===== 2025 Q3  (2025-04-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Marco, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel: Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the March quarter and our June quarter outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace; and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market closed and available on our website along with supplemental materials. We are presenting today's discussion and metrics on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. All full-year references made refer to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin with some introductory comments on the business environment and the quarter, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Now over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. I will start our March quarter results and talk about some comments about the current business environment, followed by some recent market share reports and finish up with some business highlights. KLA's March quarter results were above the midpoint -- all the guidance range with revenue of $3.06 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.41 and GAAP diluted EPS of $8.16. KLA's results continue to be fueled by strong demand in leading-edge logic and high-bandwidth memory. KLA's growing advanced packaging business also made another strong contribution in the quarter. These drivers demonstrate the critical investment required for building out the infrastructure, which is supporting AI. While there's notable macro uncertainty across many sectors globally, KLA has not seen any change in demand or indication from our customers of any adjustment to their announced investment plans. That said, the current unprecedented global trade uncertainty and potential second order effects on macro demand in the future are far from clear. Given this fluid business operating environment and potential implications for KLA, we've decided to postpone our Investor Day from June 18 to early to mid-calendar 2026. It's our hope that the macro environment will stabilize by then, and we look forward to expanding on the story of KLA's growth strategy and increasing market relevance. Our capital return announcements today reflect not only our commitment to assertive and explicit capital allocation, but also our confidence in the business opportunities for KLA over the foreseeable future. Moving along to market share reports. This quarter marks the annual release of industry research reports showing KLA maintain a strong global share of WFE and Process Control market for calendar 2024. KLA continued share leadership was highlighted by persistently strong customer adoption of optical patterned wafer inspection and share gain in advanced wafer level packaging. Over the past five years, KLA's share of Process Control has grown by nearly 250 basis points. Notably, KLA's Process Control share of advanced wafer-level packaging market has grown from being in the third position in 2019 to being on track assume the leading position in 2025. Turning to highlights for the quarter. KLA delivered a 30% year-over-year increase in revenue in the March quarter due to increased investment in leading-edge logic and HPM. Second, AI continues to be a key catalyst, driving KLA's consistently strong performance. As AI continues to advance the semiconductor industry is experiencing more complex design, accelerating product cycles, high-value wafer volumes and growing advanced packaging demand. These trends underscore the increased value of process control and assisting our customers in managing a dynamic production environment as investments and complexity increase, which uniquely benefits KLA. The further demonstration of this, the March quarter captured another period of strong momentum for our advanced packaging portfolio. Customers' adoption of KLA's advanced packaging portfolio of products, demonstrate the success of our market diversification, product technology roadmap and growth strategies. KLA's advanced packaging revenue grew to over $500 million in calendar 2024 and is now expected to exceed $850 million in calendar 2025. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew to $669 million in the March quarter, up modestly sequentially and up 13% year-over-year. Newly announced market access restrictions in early December 2024 from the U.S. government export controls impacted service revenue growth in the March quarter. Still, as a sign of its predictability and resiliency, our Service business marked its 52nd consecutive quarter of growth on a year-over-year basis. Finally, the March quarter was another solid quarter from a cash flow and capital returns perspective. Quarterly free cash flow was $990 million. Over the past 12 months, free cash flow was $3.5 billion with a free cash flow margin of 30% over the same period. This free cash flow margin ranks amongst the top 10% of companies in the S&P 500. Total capital returns in the March quarter was $733 million, comprised of $507 million in share repurchases and $226 million in dividends. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $3 billion. KLA's results once again demonstrated Process Control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio and competitive differentiation. Our consistent performance further demonstrates the critical nature of KLA's products and services, which are uniquely positioned to enable growth at the leading edge including the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure. With that, I'll pass the call over to Bren to cover financial highlights and our outlook.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA's March quarter results demonstrate market leadership combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team to get customer commitments and driving strong results, which fueled double-digit year-over-year growth and profitability improvement. Revenue was $3.06 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $3 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.41 and GAAP diluted EPS was $8.16, each finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. At the guided tax rate 13.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share would have been $8.55. Gross margin was 63%, about 50 basis points higher than the midpoint of guidance, as product mix within our Process Control segment was stronger than modeled for the quarter. Operating expenses were $575 million, about $10 million below the guidance midpoint, as the timing of prototype material expenses were lower than expected. Operating expenses were comprised of $338 million in R&D and $237 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 44.2%. Other income and expense net was a $36 million expense. The quarterly effective tax rate was 15%. Net income was $1.12 billion, GAAP net income was $1.09 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow $990 million. The breakdown of record of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4 billion of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, Debt of $5.9 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. KLA's balance sheet provides the ability to fund our growth strategies, organic and inorganic and offer attractive capital returns to shareholders. The cornerstone of KLA's business is consistently generates strong free cash flow driven by one of the best operating models in the industry and a predictable and highly differentiated service business, which helps drive a capital return strategy that includes consistent dividend growth and increasing share repurchases over the long-term. This strategy supports a strong track record of predictable and asserted capital deployment and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis. To further underscore our commitment to capital returns and our confidence in the long-term value accretion of KLA, today, we announced the 16th consecutive annual dividend increase, which is up 12% to $1.90 a share per quarter or an annualized dividend of $7.60. Along with this action, we also announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, raising our total repurchase authorization to $5.46 billion. Turning to the outlook. The industry outlook continues to be driven by increasing investments in leading-edge logic, high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. For WFE in 2025, our outlook remains the same as in late January. We forecast WFE to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage from approximately $99 million to $100 billion level in calendar 2024. Growth is expected to be driven principally by increasing investments in both leading-edge foundry and logic and memory to support growing AI and premium mobile demand, partially offset by lower overall demand from China. Given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities and higher expected process control intensity at the leading edge across all segments, we are confident we will continue to deliver growth outperformance compared with the WFE market in 2025. KLA's unique product portfolio differentiation and value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, accelerating process node capacity ramps and ensuring yield entitlement and high-volume production. We remain encouraged that our customer discussions have not changed and are working hard to align shipment slots with their requirements. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting our customers, executing our product roadmaps and driving productivity across the enterprise. KLA's June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $3.075 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry/Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 69%. The memory is expected to be approximately 31% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 76% of the revenue mix and NAND, the remaining 24%. Gross margin is forecasted to be 63%, plus or minus one percentage point, inclusive of the impact of recently announced global tariffs. This estimate is to the best of our ability, given the complexity and of the regulations and how they align with our global processes. Consistent with this assessment, we expect global tariffs to have a roughly 100 basis point headwind to gross margin per quarter, assuming relatively stable quarterly revenue expectations for the remainder of the calendar year. Of course, this environment is changing rapidly, and we will continue our assessment and evaluate mitigation opportunities within our operational processes and pricing strategies. For calendar 2025, based on results for the March quarter, guidance for the June quarter and our expectations for business mix across systems and services, systems product mix and factory utilization, we expect gross margins for the year to be approximately 62.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Other model assumptions include other income and expense net of approximately a $35 million expense for the June quarter and expect this to be roughly consistent throughout the calendar year. The effective tax rate assumption for June is 13.5%. Beginning in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year, our effective tax rate will reflect the adoption of global taxation Pillar 2, which is expected to increase the rate to approximately 14% in the second half of the calendar year. For the June quarter, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $8.28 plus or minus $0.78, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.53 plus or minus $0.78. A quick update on our remaining performance obligations or RPO disclosure in our SEC filings. As a reminder, RPO is primarily a systems only metric for KLA. In our report, RPO during earnings as it is disclosed on our subsequently filed SEC 10-Q and 10-K reports. There is significant divergence in practice and companies have different definitions and disclosure practices on RPO. This lack of consistency among companies reporting can be a source of confusion for investors and make the disclosure difficult to compare across industries and peer companies. We will continue to provide our backlog balance annually in our 10-K report. We will update our quarterly disclosures for RPO starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, which is the quarter ending September 30, 2025, to be a transaction price for contracts that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of the end of the quarter. This disclosure of RPO would be consistent with the disclosure of our industry peers. In conclusion, our near-term revenue guidance continues to point relative to stability around current business levels despite the increased uncertainty from changes to global trade. We are staying close to customers as they also navigate this challenging environment. We continue to see solid growth in calendar 2025 and expect to outperform the mid-single-digit WFE growth rate by several points. KLA's focus on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer-term relevancy and growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, KLA is focused on implementing our strategic objectives designed to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, innovative solutions and operational excellence drives industry-leading financial performance and allows us to return capital consistently. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Operator, can you please provide the instructions and begin the queue.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon Great job on another solid quarter of execution. Despite the view that team is still going to drive $3 billion plus per quarter throughout the year, you're holding your WFE view of up mid-single digits percentage year-over-year, you're not seeing any major changes to your customer spending plans. Yes, you did highlight the 100 basis points hit to gross margin due to tariffs, but at the same time, you did also take up your full year guidance on gross margins, but you're postponing your Analyst Day by nine months to a year on the potential trade and tariff uncertainty. I understand the direct impact concerns and risk on global demand for electronics. But is there also a significant tariff-related risk on your equipment and systems post, let's say, the 90-day reciprocal tariff I mean, the team, I thought was fairly geographically diversified across your manufacturing base. I wouldn't think so. Maybe just take us through some of the puts and takes around tariffs and trade and your ability to modulate your global manufacturing operations under different tariff-related scenarios to minimize the impact on your system shipping to different geographies.
Bren Higgins: Hi, Harlan, it's Bren. Thanks for the comments, and there's a lot in there. The first thing I'll say is our decision to push the Investor Day was really just related to the current uncertainty, obviously, global trade structure and construct that's being discussed today is really unprecedented, and we'll have to see how that settles out. I did talk a little bit about our view on tariff impact to KLA, and of course, that's very fluid and could change, but we do see a little bit of a headwind in our gross margin as it relates to mostly our service business and having such a strong contract stream, particularly in places like China, where you have some reciprocal impact of parts going in that can have an effect on our business. So you have that exposure, you also have whatever we bring into the U.S. factory. So some of that is being mitigated through different exemptions. And so I think there's some fluidity on that. So we'll see how that plays out over time. But -- and there's also some mitigation steps we can take from a process point of view in terms of how we manage our network, move parts around the world and so on. Obviously, when you do things like that, you're going to focus on what's the right thing for the business operationally. And certainly, in a higher structural tariff environment, you might consider doing things where return on investment might be higher. So we have to go and evaluate those things. We're looking at that. We're also looking at longer-term pricing strategy as well in terms of mitigation effects. So when we thought about the Investor Day, we said, look, there's this tariff concern, what it does to in terms of second order impact to the macro, some unknowns associated with that. So we thought it was prudent for us to just move it into early '26, where we feel like we hopefully have a more stable environment. So we're looking forward to it. We're pretty excited about what's happening in the business. You put out a lot of our strength in our results and what we've seen over the last few years in terms of our relative growth and share of WFE. So we think we're pretty well positioned both in core WFE, but also opportunities in advanced packaging. And our service business performed extremely well despite some of the challenges with export control. So we think the business is in a pretty good place, and we are just reacting to global macro environment that's changed a lot in the last three months. As it relates to the footprint, we have a pretty diverse footprint around the world. We've established it over the past two decades. We've moved products to different locations. I'd say again that you start with where it makes sense to do things operationally, whether it's cost or execution talent and so on, and then you optimize as it relates to taxes or incentives or other potential regulations. So those things can change. And so you have to make sure that the operational considerations are first and foremost. So we have a global footprint. We'll assess the situation, and we'll do what we think is right for the business over time, and that's pretty much all I have to say about it.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then maybe on a bright note, Rick, as you mentioned in your shareholder letter, calendar '24, share rankings are out for Process Control. The team and the Process Control segment outgrew overall WFE last year. And despite your dominant number one position, you're 6.5 times larger than your number two competitor in the space, you still gained 50 basis points of share and strong number one position, I think by my count, in five out of the six major subsegments within Process Control, I think the one area where it was a bit of a surprise where you made significant progress was in e-beam pattern wafer inspection and despite optical continuing to dominate at a 7x larger market versus e-beam, the KLA team did double their e-beam inspection revenues last year. You gained about 700 basis points of share there. So the team's strategy has always been to introduce new solutions when the market is ready to adopt. So what's driving the incremental opportunity in e-beam? And how is the KLA's e-beam platform sort of differentiated?
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Harlan. Yes, I think that the progress we made in e-beam has been long coming. I mean, we've been investing in our platforms for many years in terms of getting the e-beam products to where we thought they could really be supplemental to the optical and work in concert. And I think a lot of the success that we're now seeing is we got those platforms to start performing at a high level, and customers have now had a chance to evaluate them. And I think what we're finding, especially on the very high end of the most challenging layers of the most challenging nodes is that people are actually doing both. They're doing optical EV mod, some of those layers. And the synergy between the two tools -- I mean one of the things we always look for the interoperability between the two, so that you can leverage the strength of e-beam with optical. So we're seeing those results. I think, more importantly, our customers are seeing them, and we felt good about it because, as you know, often this takes months or quarters for customers to really test out the capability. So we're confident that we're on a trajectory where we're going to keep growing that business. And -- at this point, we're really glad we invested for so many years. I think there was a time where we're spending a lot of money on e-beam and it took a long time to get these results, but we're really thrilled with where we are now and our customers are telling us we need more. And so from that standpoint, we're excited about forecast. We ran into a problem last year where as we started getting demand, we didn't even have capacity. So Bren and the ops team had to ramp it up to be able support it. So we're in good shape with that. We got a great customer feedback and very excited about the progress we've made in e-beam.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren.
Richard Wallace: Thanks.
Operator: And we'll go next to Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the services growth. I understand that it's a bit pressured this year because of the loss of fabs in China. Can you talk about your full year outlook on the services for this year?
Bren Higgins: Sure, Atif. So yes, the biggest impact we felt was in Q1, where growth quarter-to-quarter was fairly limited. It was despite losing access to the fabs to put up our 52nd quarter of year-over-year growth. Consecutive quarter year-over-year growth was, I think, pretty impressive and the team did very well with that. Last year, when I think about just the semi PC part of the business, now there's also our EPC part of service, but semi PC grew -- in 2024, grew above trend line about mid-teens, about 16%. This year, I think it will be low double digits. So if you look at the total service growth, our expectations for the year are trending right around 10% or so. So a little bit below the long-term target. But given the impact of those controls where you lose access to those tools. Now as those tools are providing limited in what kind of supply they can provide to the broader market to meet demand, you would expect some capacity to potentially get added in other places that offsets that. So we would think over the long-term that you get that business back as we model our service growth over the long run, really based on long-term growth expectations for internal in terms of useful life, rising ASP, but also growth in semi revenue. So long term, we feel very good about the long-term target. In 2025, we're going to be slightly below at around 10%.
Atif Malik: Great. And as a follow-up, on advanced packaging momentum, good to see you guys raising the bar to $850 million and number one market share this year. Rick, if you can just pull a curtain a bit on your kind of competitive positioning in advanced packaging? Are you stronger on the logic or the side or the HPM side? And what are your thoughts about hybrid bonding adoption?
Richard Wallace: So I think I mentioned this before, Atif, that what we've really seen is the market in many ways has come to us. And this really kicked off a couple of years ago, mainly around packaging that we've seen pushed for AI applications and just the very -- the high cost of that entire package. And therefore, it can support the kind of cost per inspection that you couldn't support on, frankly, lower-cost solutions in terms of the packages. So these packages, as you know, if you have a large chip combined with a number of memory chips that are stacked, the value of that is very high. So it's both inspection and measurement, but also some of the process capability that we have in SPTS. That's really differentiation in the solutions. In many ways, what we've done is we've taken the products that we have for the front end and adapted them for the back end, and that's what's getting traction now. And mainly, it's with and we've seen a lot of applications driving, and we see big growth. So we talked about going to $500 million to $850 million, and frankly, that growth trend continues, that's the message we're getting from our customers. So one of things that we're still sorting through is what the available market is for KLA because we think about how much of WFE do we talk about, but there's also all this investment that's not necessarily included that in packaging. And so we're still sorting through what that looks like, and that's going to help us outperform the overall industry.
Bren Higgins: So I think one other point on this is, to Rick's point about being able to adapt our front-end solutions to the back-end is there are some incremental engineering requirements as it relates to handling of substrates and so on in different environmental conditions is that that's a lot of engineering at least from a sensitivity and performance point of view in the systems that has already been done. So the ability to take that also brings a nice incremental profit stream to the company as we leverage some of the -- some of that to capability. And as that market starts to move to needing more capability, then you move up the value stack in terms of KLA solutions to address those challenges for our customers. So it's a great opportunity from a growth point of view, but it's also an opportunity from a margin point of view of something that was a bit a headwind given the nature of what was required that turns into a tailwind as customers demand more capability from us. So we're really excited about that opportunity moving forward, particularly given the growth rates of advanced wafer-level packaging is likely faster than overall WFE growth over the next several years.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we will go to Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya: Thank you. I had near and longer term question. On the near-term, I saw that China, I think, came in at about 26% in March. I think you had estimated closer to 29%. So does it go up in a kind of flattish top line year? And related to that, the $500 million impact that you had mentioned for the year, how much did you see in calendar Q1? How much more is left to go?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, on the map for China. And you're right, we spent some time on it last quarter. And we thought that for 2025, the business would be somewhere overall, our percent of business in China would be somewhere in high 20s, maybe 30%. And our view is still consistent with that. Now I think it will be lumpy over the course of the year in terms of what shows up in any given quarter. So it was 26% in Q1. We'll see. I'm not going to guide Q2. We'll see what ends up coming in from a revenue recognition point of view. But over the course of the year, right around 30%. And I think when you look at that relative to our expectations for the year, with some of soft guidance we've given about second half revenue, then that translates into China being down about 15% to 20% or so for the year the overall company. As far as the export control impact, we really size that based on the impact that we had through the month of December and some of the juggling of shipments as it related to certain other customers that might have taken tools through 2025. And I didn't really focus on what happened in the given quarter as our business is pretty fluid. So things move around. Our view of the impact is still consistent with what I said last quarter at $500 million of revenue, plus or minus $100 million, with roughly 70% of that being -- or 65% to 70% of that being systems, still the same. But I'm not going to bridge back to what happened in Q1 versus other quarters. We've looked at the total impact over the next -- at the time, roughly four-plus quarters and that's how we size the impact.
Vivek Arya: All right. And from a follow-up, I know a little early, but I'm curious, like, what's on your dashboard to gauge whether 2026 WFE could be up, down flat? How does China figure into it in terms of opportunity and risk because a lot of long-term investors in KLA, they're always looking out. So how would you want them to think about what your opportunity set is in 2026? Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Right. So 2026 for us right now, that was obviously a big question earlier this year as we thought about some of the macro uncertainty. The feedback we're getting for the AI build-out, I think it's really important for everybody to understand what our customers are telling us is that they're still building for capacity that is less than the stated demand out there for the capability. So if you think about how many wafer starts are being started and what the implications on some of the hyperscaler CapEx would be it's still understated. And so we think that, that will continue to grow, and that's the feedback we're giving. And part of the thing that's so hard to handicap is, how does this get impacted by some of the macro stuff. So the driver for us, we said at the beginning of the year clearly was leading edge. And it's the three things we talked about is advanced logic in support of all the design starts, the bigger die, everything in support of AI, whether it's the training or the inference chips and -- custom silicon. And then it's the HBM and there are multiple players in that, and that's a more inspection intense technology than we've had in memory for a long time. And then this [technical difficulty] I think we're still early days in all of those areas in terms of the amount of silicon that's being brought online. So I think in support of that, you're going to see continued growth at the leading edge, primarily driving those other sectors. The thing that's been slow has been, we just haven't seen much come back in terms of handsets or PCs. And those are the markets that, as you know, consume a lot of the silicon. So I think we'll know a lot more about 2026 as this build-out for 2025 continues. But the conversations we're having right now, absent any other macro goals, I think, looks pretty encouraging in terms of what the overall forecast looks like as we go out and really as we go out towards 2030. And so that's the -- we think we're early on. And today, as you know, aftermarket, there are some hyperscalers that announced continued and sometimes even increased investment in the AI infrastructure. So we think we're in a great position right now.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on that, Rick. I mean, is cleaner in space of potential kind of gating factors as you look into '26? Or how do you think about that aspect of it?
Richard Wallace: No, I don't think so. I mean I the question is going to be I think they can build, depending on where they're building, they can get the shelves up and get them positioned to invest. So no, I don't think for the plans that we see -- I mean, I think -- I've always felt that the connection one would draw from all hyperscalers and the concern that people had about his AI overheated, I would look to the silicon at the leading edge being the governing factor. And the good news on that is I don't think they're going to overbuild. And then the good news is there's going to be steady growth in the next several years to support it. So that's why we're a little more sanguine about what are people saying about the overbuild. But I don't think there's overbuild and I think there is going to be additional capacity when needed. We're in a lot of conversations with our leading-edge customers about that and we have pretty good insight into what their needs are going to be down to specific products. And in some areas, just I mentioned the e-beam one earlier, we're getting heads up that we've got to add capacity. And for us, it takes a while to be able to support that. So I think we're in good shape for -- as we look out in -- the rest of the year and I think as we look into '26, we're feeling pretty excited about the opportunity.
Joe Quatrochi: That's very helpful. And maybe one for Bren. Just I wanted to kind of better understand just the uptick in the full year gross margin, just given the fact that the dynamics around tariffs that you talked about. Maybe can you just help us like understand kind of what's giving you the confidence there to increase it?
Bren Higgins: Yes. No, it's -- I appreciate the question, Joe. And I think what we're seeing is from a mix point of view, we've had a bit of headwind over the last few years as it relates to some of the cost dynamics as with the inflation that we experienced and what that meant to product cost. And as we're shipping new platforms, it's the opportunity for KLA generally to reset that as we deliver more favorable cost of ownership to our customers, but then reset that and the capability that exists in the next generation of product that comes to market. So that's certainly been a factor. I mentioned earlier that we're starting to see some scale benefits as it relates to advanced packaging, which we're encouraged by as well. So there's a number of factors. I'd say most of it is in product mix, but there's been certainly some opportunities for us to deal with some of the cost pressures we felt over the last few years. So yes, we've got the tariff impact. But despite that, I feel that we are trending more or less in line with this expectation of margins somewhere around 62.5% as we finish the year, plus or minus 50 basis points, so 63% in March and then the guidance, 63% plus or minus 1% for June. And then as you look forward, we're going to be somewhere, even with the full quarter of potential tariff impact is roughly 100 basis points. We're still somewhere in and around that 62% range given expectations for revenue levels that are relatively stable.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Timm Schulze-Melander with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Maybe the first one, just on the sequential Q-on-Q. Could you just help us maybe with a bit of the gross profit bridge, pretty flat revenues but a really decent impact on gross margin? Maybe if you could just peel back some of the moving parts, that would be really helpful. Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Well, I think gross margin is roughly flat -- as you look at the -- because we were 63% and then we're guiding in March, and we're guiding 63% at a roughly flat revenue number. So there's some puts and takes -- some puts and takes in there as it relates to the different products that are revenue in the quarter. But in general, our expectation is pretty consistent for the company overall.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Yes. I was thinking more about the March quarter compared to the December quarter.
Bren Higgins: March compared to December. Okay. No, that's a great question. So if you look at March overall, it was mostly related to -- typically for KLA, our biggest issues tend to be really around the product mix of our business. And so we had some higher value systems. Not every product and KLA portfolio carries the same margin. So the margin was more weighted to some of our higher value products.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Okay. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. I think if I caught it correctly, you talked about the service business basically being the sort of source potential tariff impact to margins. Maybe if you could just give us a bit of color about that and also maybe just kind of how you're thinking about how you might respond to that pressure kind of on a medium- to longer-term basis?
Bren Higgins: Well, one thing that's unique about KLA's service business is it's a high percentage of our revenue is contract revenue. And so we deliver and customers pay by a service contract, and we support the system and make commitments for service and support, uptime and performance, availability and so on as it relates to those systems. So as part of that, then we have to then also ensure that we've got the parts whenever there are failures. So typically, in a particular region, we are importing those parts to support the tools. And given it's a contract stream, we're the importer. So potentially carry some exposure depending on where those parts might to be coming from - and so there have been some exemptions that have come through as it relates to that, particularly as it relates to parts going into China, but that's been where we do have some exposure. So we'll see how that plays out. So that's the aspect that's tied to service. Obviously, you have tariffs potentially on parts that are coming from outside the country into the U.S. for tools that we're building in in our factory the U.S. that then ultimately, those tools stay in the U.S. If they round trip out of the U.S., then you can then draw back some of that. But as it relates to the service piece, the issue is, as I talked about. Now you're in a billable situation, you could potentially adjust the customer because comes an ex-works type transaction, the customer would potentially then have to be the importer and then have the tariff liability. But because of the contract structure, it's a little bit different for us. Now ultimately, over time, if you're ending up with a structural cost increase, you have to come up with ways to pass that cost along. And so there are different pricing strategies that we need to consider in our business based on what the long-term implications are.
Timm Schulze-Melander: Thank you, Bren.
Operator: We'll go next to C. J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C. J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Bren, I'm just trying to dig into your kind of relatively stable half-on-half revenue outlook better than some of your peers. So curious, is that a function of perhaps less memory exposure, sustainable foundry or greater seasonality from PCB in the second half or SPTS kind of taken off? I guess, what are the key drivers of driving that sustainability?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I'm taking a quick look here, C.J. As I look at it, it looks on a half-to-half point of view, looks fairly stable. I would say memory potentially could tick up a bit and foundry logic looks like it is probably make it tick down a little bit. But I don't see a lot of moving parts here as I look at it moving forward, I'd say the percent of businesses, at least as it relates to our semiconductor customers, it's pretty consistent.
C. J. Muse: Great. And then I guess as my follow-up, you highlighted great growth in advanced packaging. The lion's share of that is CoWoS. Can you speak to kind of the work you're doing on HBM, how you're thinking about insertions? Is it 8PM 4E, and is there a way to kind of size the opportunity sitting here today? Or is it too early? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes. So I would say that we have -- we're certainly seeing increasing momentum. Most of our exposure and the share that we've seen -- the share gain we've seen has been on the logic side, but in high bandwidth memory, as customers are going to increase stacks of chips, it's creating incremental opportunity. So we feel like we're getting more traction, it's driving the need for more capability and we're getting more traction with certain customers. So we think, over time, as you see a selection process as a customer transitions, it creates an opportunity for us to compete for some business. As you know, those customers are running at pretty aggressive capacity levels in terms of delivering for their customers. So when you're in that environment, you don't necessarily want to change anything. So I think we have to wait for a selection as you move into higher stacks. And then obviously, ultimately, as you think about technology changes with hybrid bonding down the road creates another incremental opportunity. So we're seeing increasing momentum on the memory side, and would expect that to continue as we go through really as we continue to this year and into next year.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on branding. When I look at the U.S. revenue, it's up Q-o-Q, but the dollar figures are still pretty low. And I'm just trying to reconcile that with what TSM said about investing in Arizona. Do you think the Process Control being an early cyclical, some of the early purchases for Arizona are done? Or do you think there's still potential for the rest of the year? And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Most of our business when our biggest customers that were in centric. So that isn't -- most of that is going to Taiwan and not into Arizona. Arizona has been a slow investment cycle over the last few years. So there's been a level of business that we've had that's been a kind of low levels -- lower levels consistently over the course of a longer period of time. But given the focus and the drive on into, that's driving most of our business into Taiwan.
Krish Sankar: Got it. And then a quick follow-up on tariffs. Thanks for the color on the service impact from tariffs. I understand a lot of moving parts, but I'm just wondering, if it ever comes to it, can you meet non-U.S. demand from your non-U.S. manufacturing facilities and U.S. demand from the U.S.? Or is it not as simple as that?
Bren Higgins: As it relates to service?
Krish Sankar: No, as it relates to systems.
Bren Higgins: Well, look, as I said in the first question, I think it was Harlan's question at the beginning. We have a global footprint, and we've established it over the last couple of decades. We've moved products around the world depending on what makes sense operationally for us. You can't do anything in a short period of time. In a longer period of time, you'd have to consider, I think it would be very hard for us to have complete capability across factories. We certainly aren't in a position necessarily to do that today. But could you, over time, increase your flexibility, you'd have to make some investments to be able to do that, you potentially could do those things. But you be comfortable that that you're facing an environment is not going to change because those are significant investments you have to make.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tom O'Malley: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first was just in regards to C.J.'s question earlier just on the second half and whether it's weighted memory or Foundry/Logic. And it sounded like memory is up a little a little bit, Foundry/Logic maybe down little bit. If you look at the mix of memory, some of your peers have already talked about like a sharper falloff in the second half when it comes to NAND. And I fully appreciate that your business is very small there. But the correct interpretation of that, that the DRAM side gets a little bit stronger and you see a little weakness on that? Are you seeing anything different just given or the timing of your NAND business?
Bren Higgins: I say that DRAM is the biggest driver. What you're seeing in NAND is more technology investments and some upgrades. So there's some activity there, but it's fairly limited. Most of what's driving our business is investment supporting our bandwidth memory.
Tom O'Malley: Helpful. And then I think that it's obviously brave of you guys to go out there and kind of talk about tariff impacts already when many of your peers have kind of said, hey, don't look at the second half and you guys are being pretty prescriptive when it comes to the gross margin. So maybe it's helpful. Can you guys talk about what you guys did in order to get to that 100 basis points per quarter? Like did you look at different facilities? Did you take everything as a whole? Like any kind of description or color as to how you got to that number would be super helpful. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Well, so Tom, what I didn't do was -- what we had to do was really just drill through all of our business, right? And there's a fair amount of unknowns. What I didn't say early on was the various caveats, right, that things could change. And certainly, we're in a pretty fluid dynamic and who knows something could change in a short period of time. We'll see what happens in 90 days and so on. But we know what we're what we're shipping and bringing in with our bill plans and given our lead times, what's coming into our factories around the world, obviously, we have visibility into the contract streams from a service point of view, given how unique that business is in the industry and how our customers -- our percent of business is -- that's a contract base is much higher than what other companies might have. And look, we'll see. I said roughly around 100 basis points. We'll see if things change. But at the end of day, I can I can look at what's in service, look at what's in the factories. There are some potential unknowns as you think about what might come from suppliers, but we think we handicap that as best we could. And then there's obviously mitigation steps that we'll take over time to offset whatever pressures we might feel. So -- and we can do...
Richard Wallace: Let me add. Because it reports to brand, but have a really strong logistics team and the same team that got us through COVID without missing deliveries and without lifting guidance was the team that drilled through all this. So I would say that Bren's team was all over this. And that's why we were able to like assess the impact and then change even during the week, we were doing it or a few days, as the rules change. So I don't think it was luck, and we're not guessing. We did a lot of detailed work. The assumptions could change over time. And that's part of the concern we have about having everybody together for an Investor Day is something that changed the morning of that day. And so we're kind of waiting for things to settle out. But it was a lot of hard work. We know where our parts come. We understand the rules and we applied them. That's how we got there.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. I have a follow-up about the second half comments that you made in particular about the Foundry/Logic. I think the comment was that it's going to tick down a little bit. It was down a bit, and then you're guiding kind of flattish for this quarter. I'm guessing most of that is China. I'm just curious as to how you're expecting, and two, demand to kind of fare? And if you can talk about where we are in the N2 cycle? And then, I guess, as we go to next year, when do we expect 1.4 to kind of kick in?
Bren Higgins: Well, so I think around N2, the investment cycle we're seeing this year looks pretty strong as we've said, and we feel pretty good about its continuation of next year. Our customers are going to add in this first year, somewhere around to 40,000 to 50,000 wafer starts. And we think that that you'll see at least a doubling of that into next year, maybe more. So we feel pretty good about some of the moving parts, it's not our only customer that's investing here. And so like I said earlier, I think half to half, it's things tick up a little bit, things ticked down a little bit, but more or less our mix of business expectations from where we started the year is more or less about the same.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it. And then more of a longer-term question. I'm just curious to understand a little better what the implications from high NA. I know it's early days, but as we go to high NA, I'm reading that the reticle sizes will come down. I'm guessing the complexity will increase quite a bit. And of course, packaging complexity will go up. But if reticle come down. So just curious to understand what the implications for semi PC intensities with?
Richard Wallace: I think those are exactly some of the issues that our customers are considering as they think about when to insert and how much to insert. I think that the one thing that is definitely true is the reason you want high NA is because you want to print smaller features. And that's always been a driver for our business because the same thing that allows you to print smaller features means that smaller defects matter more. So our customers, when they go -- when they increase the resolution on their lithography, have to increase their sensitivity on their inspection. That's a good thing. And also, at the same time, it means that we've got to drive our capability to have more detection on those advanced devices. The reticle quality and the verification of reticles has been a huge driver in EUV in general, and that created a whole separate category of what we call print check, which is where people take the wafers that are being printed by EUV and they inspect the wafer to verify the design. Even though there are tools for reticle, there's also that additional. We would expect, especially in the early days of high NA that there would be more radical check required. So from our standpoint, it drives increased percent of inspection and measurement because of the continued scaling, but it also -- we're working very closely with our customers who are considering that because one of the decision points they have is do they have the metrology and inspection to make those nodes work. So that's a big part of the conversation. So I would say that the most likely scenario for High-NA is when it gets introduced, it will be at a limited number of layers on whatever device or node that it's introduced and our customers because they have to be thoughtful, we'll have a backup plan in terms of whether it's multi-patterning or other ways to achieve their objectives. So it's in the end, good for us as EUV has been good for driving relevance and of inspection. But I think it remains to be seen when that timing actually happens and what devices. And I'm quite sure because our customers keep telling us it's going to be based on their economics, not just on the performance, but on the total cost of implementation.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it. Thank you, Bren.
Operator: We'll next go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Bren, I wanted to ask about semi systems half-on-half. You quantified in the presentation, you actually quantified the outgrowth relative to this mid-single-digit WFE this year. You said you're going to outgrow by several points. So if WFE is up 5, I take several to So that means systems will grow like 8, and you did 7.5% in last year. So that puts you at 8% for the year. So if we know what you're doing in the first half, it implies back half systems is down like 15% half-on-half. That's a lot. So do you take issue with that math? Because I thought systems were going to be more like flattish half on half, did like something change?
Bren Higgins: Yes. Hi, Tim, I'm looking at the numbers here and based on revenue expectations, I think semi PC systems are going to be roughly spot in the second half of year.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Then outgrow by a lot more than 7...
Bren Higgins: Yes, several points relative to the WFE is up mid-single digits, I said we'd do several points better than that.
Timothy Arcuri: Yes. Well, if the numbers are going to be up like 12%. So that's like a lot more than several. But anyway, okay, so then on RPO. So why stop reporting RPO midyear? Was it like causing the problem? And then I guess, you said that you're going to include it to be the transaction price for contracts that have not yet been recognized as the end of the quarter. So how is the new practice different from current practice?
Bren Higgins: So we're not going to stop at mid fiscal year, we're just giving you a heads up that we're going to make a change going into our new fiscal year, which begins on July 1. So it's the September 30 ending quarter. If you look at the quarter we just completed, and you'll see the actual numbers based on the historical practice in the 10-Q that we'll file at the end of this week is the RPO came down to about 8.9%, changed a couple of hundred million, so not really much change in it. Our view moving forward was one of the things that was -- and it's something that we spent a significant amount of time on over the last several months is that companies -- the disclosure practices across companies very widely hear about what RPO really is. And so what we're really trying to do here is converge towards where we think the majority of our companies are. I mean, the whole point of disclosures is to be able to make adequate comparisons across companies, across industries. You certainly can't do that with this metric given the wide divergence and practices that people have related to it. So we think our view is a good balance view moving forward. What's actually an obligation is something that has shipped to customers and has an FPA, whether it's that or whether it's a service contract that's been signed. And so our RPO guidance will converge to that, which is more of a deferred revenue -- the deferred revenue disclosure across our systems and service. And we'll provide a backlog assessment, which is more or less what we were doing before in our case going forward. So we're going to continue to tune as we complete this year, and then we're going to make some changes moving next year. So we can be consistent -- a little bit more consistent with what the rest of industry and equipment. And so I think if you even look across large caps, you'll see that the three large caps do it have been doing it all differently. So it's a source of confusion. I get it lot. So what we're trying to do is align more closely with what some of our peers are doing.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, Bren. Awesome, thanks.
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Tim.
Operator: We have time for one more question. We'll go next to Melissa Weathers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Melissa Weathers: Thank you for letting me ask a question and squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on the high-volume manufacturing side. This is a big theme that you guys talked about at your last Analyst Day as you shift from more of like R&D-type spending to HVM spending and being a bigger part of the mix there. So how are you seeing this play out in the current leading edge nodes and maybe future nodes? Like is there any way you can help us contextualize how much the HVM opportunity is for KLA?
Bren Higgins: Historically, KLA was more levered towards R&D and fab ramp and as a fab move to entitlement yield levels. There was a reduction in Process Control intensity and shift in our customers strategy to focusing and driving productivity in the fab. As the design start environment has picked up over the last several nodes, it has driven more challenges into high-volume production as customers are trying to manage yield across different process flows in a very different or robust design mix. And so as a result of that, you end up with different designs that test design rules in different ways. Our customers don't want to start any more wafers than they have if they deliver the tight market windows. And so you're seeing adoption of more process control in a high mix foundry in high-volume production. So it is changing, and we're also seeing even back boarding, where they're seeing a change in mix, where a fab at N5, for example, had certain tool set expectation based on an expected type of mix. But as you've seen more and more HPC products move through those fabs. It's driven the need for different and more capability. So you're seeing a lot more adoption in production than what you used to see if you go back 10 to 20 years in the industry. And so I think it's just really reflective of the dynamic environment our customers are trying to manage to with process windows that are extremely tight with these leading-edge nodes.
Melissa Weathers: Thank you
Operator: Thank you. And I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional and closing remarks.
Kevin Kessel: Great. Thank you, everyone, for your time and your attention, your interest in KLA. We appreciate it. I know it's a busy earnings day. We will be catching up with all of you at the upcoming conferences and meetings. With that, I’ll turn it back now to the operator for any final closing instructions.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the KLA Corporation March quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2025 Q2  (2025-01-30 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Todd, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel: Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the December quarter and calendar year 2024 results and outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on ir.kla.com along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise specified, all full year references we make are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on our call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will start with some introductory comments, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace, I wanted to remind everyone that our 2025 Investor Day will be held on the morning of June 18, in New York City. Now over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. I will summarize KLA's overall performance for calendar '24 and the December quarter and cover company highlights and updates on the industry landscape. For calendar 2024, KLA again delivered relative growth outperformance, strong profitability, and healthy return to shareholders. Specifically, 2024 revenue grew 12% to a record $10.85 billion. And the process control revenue grew by over 12%, which indicates increased market share, while the services business grew 15% to $2.5 billion a year. Also for the calendar year, KLA maintained industry leading gross and operating margins at 61% and 41%, respectively. The company grew free cash flow to $3.4 billion and returned $2.9 billion in a combination of dividends and share buybacks. KLA's outperformance for the year was driven by a return to growth at the leading edge, which includes increased investment in AI, high-performance computing and continued momentum in advanced packaging, as well as sustainable performance for KLA's services business. Turning to the December quarter results for KLA came in above the midpoint of non-GAAP guidance range, despite navigating through the business impact of the new U.S. government export controls, which were released late in the quarter. Specifically, the quarter revenue topped $3 billion for the first time. Diluted GAAP was $8.20, finishing at the upper end of the guidance range for the quarter. GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. The business landscape is performing as expected, and we're encouraged by the strong demand we're experiencing in leading-edge logic with specific memory customers supporting high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging. KLA's differentiated portfolio of solutions aligns exceptionally well with enabling our customers to navigate increasing complexity, growing design starts, and larger semiconductor devices in an environment of rising semiconductor demand. Specific highlights in the quarter include a combination of strong sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrate an improving industry environment. KLA is specifically positioned to benefit from accelerating growth at the leading edge. Across all sectors, there are technology development investments supporting AI and HBM, as well as strengthening supply-demand environment, which positions the wafer fab equipment industry for growth in calendar 2025. AI continues to be a crucial catalyst for KLA. We are well aware of the recent revelations of DeepSeek and the implications that it portends a diminished demand for advanced semiconductors in support of the AI infrastructure build-out. As a company that has been developing AI models for use in our own inspection systems for many years, our own experience supports the theory that increased compute efficiency enables more adoption of AI in our platforms. The demand is clearly elastic. As it pertains to the demand environment for advanced semiconductors, we see no reason to believe that increased compute efficiency in AI will have an impact on the advanced demand environment in the foreseeable future. AI is both an important driver and enabler of KLA's business. Specific drivers connected to AI that are a positive for KLA's growth are higher volume and higher value wafer demand, more complex designs, accelerating product cycles, larger die size, and growing advanced packaging demand. These trends demonstrate the increasing value of process control and assisting our customers through managing a dynamic production environment as investments and complexity increase. Exemplifying this momentum for our advanced packaging portfolio continued in the quarter. The growing demand for more powerful systems of chips is driving more complex heterogeneous chip integration enabled by advanced packaging, which increases the value of process control in the chip package. This is fueling growth for KLA and our broad portfolio systems. KLA advanced packaging revenue grew to approximately $500 million in calendar 2024 and is expected to exceed $800 million in calendar 2025, up from our last estimate of $750 million. KLA service business grew to $667 million in the December quarter, up 4% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. This makes 50 consecutive quarters of growth for our services business on a year-over-year basis. Finally, quarterly free cash flow was $757 million in calendar 2024, and the free cash flow margin was 31% over the same period, putting KLA amongst the top companies in the S&P 500. Total capital return in the December quarter was $877 million, comprised of $650 million in share repurchase and $227 million in dividends. Total capital return over the past 12 months was $2.9 billion. KLA views consistent and healthy capital returns as fundamental to delivering value for shareholders. KLA's December quarter results delivered strong sequential and year-over-year growth, which validates KLA's process control leadership and portfolio strength. KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams continues to be the foundation of our sustained success. We'll now pass the call over to Bren to cover financial highlights and our outlook.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA's December quarter results demonstrate market leadership, combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team to meet customer commitments and drive sequential and year-over-year growth and profitability improvements. Revenue was $3.08 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.95 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $8.20 above the guidance midpoint. GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. Gross margin was 61.7%. Operating expenses were $596 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $342 million in R&D and $254 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 42.3%. Other income and expense met with a $31 million expense. The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.7%. Net income was $1.1 billion, cash flow from operations was $850 million, and free cash flow was $757 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and markets, major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $3.8 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.9 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. During the December quarter, we retired our $750 million November 2024 bonds at maturity with cash on hand. KLA's balance sheet provides the ability to fund our growth strategies, organic and inorganic and offer attractive capital returns to shareholders. Turning to our outlook, the industry outlook continues to gain momentum in the near-term, driven by increasing investment in leading edge logic, high bandwidth memory, and advanced packaging. We expect the WFE market to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2025 from the high $90 billion level for calendar 2024. Growth in calendar 2025 is expected to be fueled principally by increasing investment in both leading-edge boundary logic and memory to support growing AI and premium mobile demand offset by lower overall demand from China due to the digestion of elevated levels of investment over the past couple of years. In an encouraging development, our top customer recently said in an earnings call that they expect the number of new takeouts for N2, or the 2 nanometer node, in the first 2 years to be higher than both N3 and N5 in their first 2 years, fueled by both smartphone and HPC applications. As communicated in early December, we continue to estimate the impact on KLA's revenue in calendar 2025 from recent export controls in China to be approximately $500 million, plus or minus $100 million with roughly 70% of the impact affecting our systems business. While we are hopeful, based on our interpretation of the regulations, that there should be licensing opportunities that will mitigate some of this impact, we are taking a cautious view given the significant delays in processing licensing requests by the U.S. government over the past few years. However, given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities, and higher expected process control intensity at the leading edge across all segments, we are confident we will continue to deliver growth outperformance compared with the WFE market in 2025. KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $3 billion plus or minus $150 million. Our revenue guidance is up 27% year-over-year at the midpoint, further illustrating the improvement we expect to see in calendar 2025. Foundry/Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 73% and Memory is expected to be approximately 27% of Semi Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 75% of the revenue mix and NAND the remaining 25%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 62% plus or minus 1 percentage point or up approximately 30 basis points sequentially at the midpoint despite slightly lower revenue primarily due to more favorable product mix expectations. For calendar 2025, based on expectations for business mix across systems and service, systems product mix and factory utilization, we expect gross margins for the year to be approximately 62% plus or minus 50 basis points. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $585 million as we continue to make significant product development and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Given our expectations for company growth over the next couple of years, we will maintain our operating expense trajectory. For the remainder of calendar 2025, we expect sequential increases of approximately $15 million in incremental operating expenses per quarter. This is driven by our priority around our product development roadmap requirements as well as revenue growth expectations. Our business model is predicated on ensuring 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over the long run. Other model assumptions include: non-GAAP other income and expense, net, of approximately a $36 million expense for the March quarter and expect this to be roughly consistent throughout the calendar year. The tax rate assumption for March remains at 13.5% and we expect this to remain through the June quarter. Beginning in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our fiscal year, our tax rate will reflect the adoption of global taxation pillar 2. Based on our current modeling, we think pillar 2 implementation will drive the tax rate slightly higher to approximately 14% in the second half of the calendar year. We will provide an update on this planning rate mid-year if necessary. For the March quarter, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $7.77 plus or minus $0.60, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.05 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 133.3 million shares. In conclusion, our near-term revenue guidance points to relative stability around current business levels. Based on the strength of our backlog and market position, we see growth in calendar 2025 and expect to outperform the mid-single-digit growth rate we expect from the WFE market. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer term relevancy and growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, KLA is focused on implementing our strategic objectives designed to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, innovative solutions and operational excellence drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A.
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Bren. Operator, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Vivek Arya with the Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Mani: Hi, this is Michael Mani on for Vivek Arya. Thank you for taking our questions. To start, we heard from two of your peers yesterday. The peer that is action deposition focused issued a pretty similar WFE view to you guys for [indiscernible] digits, while the other reiterated their annual guide suggesting that the spending remains healthy. So the question is if total WFE is increasing something like $5 billion or so this year, but within that, WFE is also increasing. [Indiscernible] is also growing pretty strong, so consuming a good part of that incremental growth. What exactly is happening to the process control part of the market this year? And if process control WFE is growing solidly, which it seems like it is, does that suggest that mid-cycle digits for WFE could be conservative, or are there other parts of the market that are shrinking by that much? Thank you.
Operator: And pardon me, do you -- speakers, do you have us muted?
Richard Wallace: My apologies.
Bren Higgins: Yes, this is Bren. I'll take that one. And the guidance was clear that we think it's somewhere in that range of about $5 billion, to use your number into 2025 versus 2024. We feel pretty good about KLA's share of overall WFE opportunity into next year. Obviously, as we move into 2025, we've got more investment in leading edge and that's certainly a nice driver for our business and we're already seeing KLA's share of WFE at the N2 node being meaningfully greater than what we saw at N3. What's happening in DRAM, first advanced DRAM is good for us with scaling and EUV but also as you look at high bandwidth memory, high bandwidth memory is also dragging process control intensity due to the lack of redundancy, more complex logic circuitry in the base die, the need for more reliability, bigger chips and so on. So, we feel pretty good about all of that. And then I think finally, the growth that we referenced in the letter in advanced packaging is accelerating for the company. It seems like every quarter I keep raising the numbers, so I'm pretty excited about the opportunities that are there and it seems to be accelerating as we move into this year. So for all those reasons, it looks like process control intensity, KLA share of market looks to increase in 2025 based on our assessment. And in an environment where memory is probably a higher percent given expected growth in DRAM, I think the dynamics I talk about more than offset a slightly changing mix that's still Foundry/Logic heavy but a little bit more DRAM in terms of our views on '25.
Michael Mani: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And for my next question, could you help us with the linearity for revenue this year to the best extent you can, just because we're kind of at a high watermark for revenue this quarter. So should we expect maybe to be more first half weighted versus second half, especially given China's normalizing into the year and there's this impact of the export restrictions that we should consider? Thank you very much.
Bren Higgins: Yes, the second half, I'm not going to comment on it. As we said in the letter, we feel pretty good about relative stability as we look at the funnel here moving forward. We'll see, as we start to move through the year what happens. But in terms of how we're modeling the company, it seems that we're bouncing around this $3 billion level, plus or minus, at least as we look at the first half of the year.
Richard Wallace: Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. In process control, strong outperformance for the team in calendar '24. I think your process control systems business was up 15% year-over-year, right? That's versus WFE at up in the mid single-digit. But if I look back over the past 5 years, the team's process control business has outgrown WFE on average by about 500 to 700 basis points per year. So given this year is going to be more leading edge technology inflection driven, which is where obviously you guys have a strong leadership position, is it fair to assume that if WFE is up mid-single-digit percentage points this year, that your process control business should grow kind of low to mid-teens percent in calendar '25?
Richard Wallace: Harlan, that's a -- thank you for those comments. Obviously, we're not going to guide for the year, but clearly, we're feeling great about the position we have. And a couple of things have changed, as you well know, in terms of the dynamics. One, because we've resumed scaling, there's more opportunity for more inspection. So I've always viewed the opportunities as being twofold. One, there needed to be an opportunity and then we had to have a solution. And sometimes we've had the case where, for example, if you go back years to 3D NAND, where of course, if we could have looked through and found defects, there would have been an opportunity, it was tough to do. But now we're really at an interesting point where the leading edge, every dynamic is going kind of in our favor. In terms of higher value wafers, you've got larger die size, we talked about this in the prepared remarks, and you've got accelerated technology nodes and more layers that need to be figured out. The other dynamic, of course, that you know is HBM is looking more like logic than it used to. Less redundancy, more valuable die, and of course the dynamic around packaging. So we feel great, as Bren said, about process controls position and overall the spend for our customers. And that's the conversation we're having with our leading customers is very focused on getting that availability and being supportive of their technology ramps as they make these big investments going forward.
Harlan Sur: That's great. Thank you for that. And then on the 60% growth outlook for your advanced packaging businesses here, can you just kind of help us unpack that a bit? How much of that mixes 2.5D packaging technology like [indiscernible] versus HBM versus other packaging types? And what is the rough mix of process control versus semi-manufacturing systems? And then we're already starting to see some future AI designs moving to 3D SoIC technology starting next year. Is this a further tailwind for the team given the higher complexity of these next generation 3D architectures?
Richard Wallace: Yes, great questions. I mean, I think two things have happened and we got this early indication from our leading customers 1.5, 2 years ago, that the challenges in packaging were going to look a lot more like what was going on in the front end, and they asked us to make some of the platforms that we use for the front end available for packaging. So back to the question, what is this? A lot of it's inspection and metrology, derivatives of the projects and programs that we have and have many years of experience with. There's clearly some plasma dicing, so SPTS [ph] is part of that overall solution. But there's no question that our customers are driving, as you know, it's a very expensive, when you have these high-end chips along with this complex packaging and this HBM, the risks are very high if there's yield loss. So there's more inspection opportunity there, and we feel great about the continued growth as we go forward. Right now it's mostly 2.5 HB, but we see it's going to go forward, and our customers are, this is an area that's moving very quickly, and because they need solutions, they're very focused on making sure we understand them as we go forward.
Bren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it's Bren here. It's about 65%, 70% semi-PC versus process.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper in your outperformance relative to WFE. Within that, you're including that 500 million China hit. And so, we'd love to hear, I guess, beyond the rising process control intensity at 2 nanometer and HBM, are there other drivers? Are those the two principal ones we should be thinking about?
Bren Higgins: Yes, those are -- C.J. those are the two principal ones.
C.J. Muse: [Indiscernible].
Bren Higgins: Yes, you've got higher intensity at the node. And to Rick's point, we feel very good about some product momentum in a number of our markets. So that's -- and then I think finally, as you look at that and you look at what's driving growth within process control, you've got an acceleration in certain products where we have a strong market position. So they're influencing the growth rate, obviously more relative to the overall. So that also drives an improvement in share. Optical pattern inspection being one of those areas.
Richard Wallace: Well, and reticle. I mean, we saw some improvement in some of the work in reticle, and including the Gen 5 CTA [ph] for print check, which obviously shows up in the optical, but it's part of that solution. So, look, we're feeling pretty good, and there was some investment made by our customers to support prior nodes once they realized that there was still a yield opportunity there.
C.J. Muse: Just to follow-up on that, Rick, you talked about share gain. Can you elaborate on that? And then my second question would be on service. You talked about hitting kind of a long-term growth rate over time, but would be curious, given kind of the China impact, how you're thinking about growth for overall service in calendar '25. Thanks so much.
Richard Wallace: Sure. So on the share side, I think there's a couple areas that might be more obvious than others. One is optical, simply because optical grew disproportionately perhaps in the rest of the market and we have a large share there, so that creates a greater overall position there. We had some really strong momentum in e-beam, but then the other area where we really saw some strong performance was in packaging. And so that's the one where the teams have really done a great job focusing the last couple of years, and we've been able to see continued momentum there. So we feel pretty good about it. Obviously the numbers for the year aren't going to come out, but we have gained a lot of share in the last couple of years, and the question was, would there be any retransfer, and we feel pretty good about where we are. For service, anytime you lose access to a fab, you have the immediate headwind that you can't get access to that equipment. So as I look at growth this year, I think growth is probably in the high single digits for service, which is below the long-term model. We outperformed the long-term model by a little bit in 2024. Over time though, it's generally our view, at least in terms of how we run the company, as we think about the efficiency of the market, that, that if you have fabs that are inhibited from being able to supply that that capacity has to get added somewhere else. And so that would create an opportunity for us to make some of that up over the very long-term. So -- and obviously that would mean that you would end up with whatever was spent before would have to be replaced somewhere else. So I think over the long run, we feel pretty good about the growth trajectory in our long-term model, but in the short run, it does affect, obviously, your ability to get at that capacity, which puts pressure on the growth rate and also puts some pressure on our ability to move resources around. And so we'll have to deal with some inefficiencies. We've staffed up to support those fabs, and now we have to move those folks to support other customers. So there's a few moving parts, but in the long run, we feel pretty good about the trajectory, given the higher value offerings, what we're seeing in terms of pricing as it relates to new products, the opportunities in packaging for incremental service. So I think that the drivers for service are all pretty compelling. Obviously, the install base is growing, lifetimes are increasing. So in the long run, we feel pretty good about the long-term target.
C.J. Muse: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Just to follow-up on the services impact from China, just given the fact that most of your services is highly recurring, do we just take that, I guess, quarterly kind of run rate impact all in the March quarter and then grow from there? Or is there further kind of headwinds to think about in the out quarters?
Richard Wallace: Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. Because you lose what you would have gotten at those fabs, and then it grows from there. So I think that's a reasonable way to think about it.
Joe Quatrochi: Okay, perfect. And then just thinking about capital intensity for process control on the DRAM side, can you talk about just the difference in HBM process control intensity, relative to conventional DRAM, just how to think about that adoption? I know, obviously, EUV being adopted across the board is helpful for you guys, too.
Richard Wallace: Yes, so as I said earlier, right, with an HBM device, you've got a few things that are happening, you've got big or die, because you have to drill the DSPs. They're bigger, so you have less redundancy, which historically has been pretty significant in DRAM, and so that's been a headwind to process control intensity. The logic circuitry is more complex. The reliability on all the guy in the stack is higher. So for all those reasons, it's very good for process control intensity. I think overall for DRAM, it's moving the needle probably somewhere from, we'll call it the 9 to 10 range where we've been historically as a percent of WFE, that it probably moves up a good 100 to 150 basis points from there. Now, obviously, mix will affect that. Most of the focus is on HBM in terms of new requirements. So mix dynamics could affect that. But we feel pretty good about these dynamics as they affect and drive the DRAM market. And it's most pronounced in the latest technology nodes and that's where we're seeing it more. And so it's going to take a little bit of a time for us to really figure out what that overall looks like. I think by Investor Day, we should be in a pretty good position to talk about it on a longer-term basis.
Joe Quatrochi: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks. Bren, can you give us RPO? It was supposed to be up. Can you give us the number?
Bren Higgins: Yes, so RPO was down about $900 million. About half of that was related to deep bookings we took due to the December 2nd regulations. So about half of it related to that and then the other half shipment levels were higher. So that's how it played out in the quarter.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay, thanks. And then process control systems, you said pretty stable from here, but what about EPC? It was up a lot this quarter. It grew a lot in, well, it didn't grow that much, but it grew a lot in Q4. So how to think about it for this year? Can it grow 10, perhaps low double digits this year?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think overall EPC is probably going to be about mid single digits. You have to remember that what shows up in EPC is flat panel business. And so at the end of this quarter, we will be done shipping systems for flat panel after we announced end of manufacturing 12 months ago. So you have the flat panel revenue coming out and so obviously that in this year affects the overall growth rate of the EPC businesses as we report those segments. So overall we feel pretty good if you look at SPTS growth especially semiconductor, mostly driven by advanced packaging growth year-to-year. ICOS, component inspection, again a packaging-centric business, is also growing. PCB businesses are more tied to mobility and capacity, so less growth in those areas. And then of course you got the offset from losing the [indiscernible]. Now, losing the [indiscernible] does enhance the margin ratios, gross margins probably 20 bps higher. I think operating margins are probably 30 bps higher because the revenue mix is a little bit richer and certainly that's factored into how we guided gross margins as we look at next year -- look at this year, 2025.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you, Bren.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. And Rick and Bren, thanks for quantifying the $500 million plus or minus impact from export control. You also spoke about China WFE digestion. I'm just kind of curious, if you lean in the digestion from China, how to think about your decline in China sales year-over-year on top of export controls in '25 versus '24?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I'll try to help with that. I mean, obviously, we'll have to see how the year plays out. But if you look at how we finished the year, right, this last quarter was 36%. We finished the year at 41% of our business in China. As we look at 2025, I think that percentage drops to about 29% plus or minus, a point or two as we go forward here. And so when you do the math on that, assuming the stability that we articulated about our top line, as we think about where we are right now, that translates into the overall China business down somewhere around 20% or so.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then another question is can I know -- to know China, I apologize for this. But when you look at your numbers compared to some of your peers over the last two quarters your China sales have been more resilient compared to your peers? Is it due to the wafer business or is it because China's building domestic critical capacity? Like what's happening there that kind of makes you relatively more resilient to your peers?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think the easiest way to think about it, you have to remember that KLA is really about helping customers qualify process and speed time to results, yield learning and so on. So as a result, you end up with, particularly with Greenfield fabs, a higher level of adoption is that fabs opening and more continuous investment at lower levels. So when a customer goes to add a significant amount of capacity, obviously more capacity centric peers are going to participate, but then they'll get it in that quarter and then it'll fall off. Where ours tends to be a little bit more consistent in terms of the investment profile. And so it also, I think, tends to hold up because I think the value of process control, given the maturity of those operations, is pretty high.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you, Bren. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Tom O'Malley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mine is a little short-term oriented, so forgive me here. But the last two evenings, we've seen you and a competitor kind of talk about better NAND pretty significantly into the March quarter. I was just hoping you could give us a little more detail. It didn't sound like from a sequential basis you would really call that out. I don't think you gave a ton of details, that would make sense. And we didn't see it coming there, but just maybe describe what's happening there. Is that coming from a single customer? Is that coming across multiple customers? I totally understand it's a much lower base from you guys, but we'd love to try to figure out where the strength is coming from just on a sequential basis into March.
Richard Wallace: It's strength at pretty low levels. It's pretty broad based. We have seen the NAND business tick up right over the course of the '24 and into '25. We expect a little bit more improvement there. I think overall for the industry off of a very low level there's likely to be some WFE growth there, but it's not significant and as a percentage it's bigger obviously given the level of WFE at that presently but would expect to see that improve a little bit moving forward, but not a lot in 2025.
Tom O'Malley: Got you. And then on the DRAM side, clearly there's debate in the broader market. You guys called out AI in some of your prepared remarks, but it seems like there's some share jockeying that's currently taking place. It sounded more positive for the year, your kind of view on the DRAM side. Any commentary, just when -- you think about 6 months ago is when you talked to your customers, obviously people were putting in capacity for kind of all 2025. Have you seen incremental spend there in the short-term or rush orders to try to catch up by customers? Anything on that would be helpful. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Well, I think our customers -- this is Rick, our customers certainly set out their plans looking out for the year, so there's been no real short-term change. I do think the strength in terms of what they're seeing in demand in support of the AI infrastructure continues to grow, and we see momentum there. So we are definitely in conversations, a lot of them about slot availability. Remember, we still have many products or a few critical products that are supply constrained so we're in conversations about that. So we feel pretty good about the demand especially at the leading edge and the dynamics around the advanced DRAM are playing to our strength because of the challenges both the value of those devices, but also the yield challenges and as we mentioned before the die size are smaller less redundancy and it's looking more like higher process control intensity as we talked about. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Chris Caso: Yes, hi. Thanks. A follow-up question with regard to the China impact. And you've given some color on what you expect that for the year. From a quarterly basis, is there any sort of incremental headwind or benefit as we go into the second half? I know that you talked about some of the mitigations and licenses, which are taking some time, but I guess how do we think about this as we go sequentially through the year?
Richard Wallace: Yes, we've been pretty cautious with it overall. We'll see how it plays out as I said in the prepared remarks in terms of licensing that could mitigate the impact, but when we look at it over the course of the year or what we expected, it was pretty consistent across the year. So, it wasn't, maybe again, that could be the nature to have customers buy process controlled versus other types of products. But it was pretty -- half to half was more or less pretty consistent.
Chris Caso: Okay. Got it. And just to follow-up on gross margins, again, you're kind of starting out with 62. You're guiding to 62 for the full year. So, sort of assuming that remains stable as you go through the year. And I guess at what point with regard to some of the operating leverage that you typically get with the fall through, what's kind of the starting point from that, that we can start to see, some of the leverage kicked in as revenue starts to grow.
Richard Wallace: We have mixed issues that that generally are the biggest impacting item to our overall gross margins, more so than customers or segments. But I would expect as we start to see overall revenue accelerate, we'll start to see the kind of leverage that we've seen historically. So I said 62% plus or minus about 50 basis points for a reason. I think some of that is predicated on what happens moving forward. We do have, depending on the mix, right, we do have markets like the packaging market which carries a lower gross margin given the complexity of the tools than some of our higher end systems, but obviously the gross margin dollars are quite significant and the relevancy growth at KLA is significant. So we're pleased with that. But I think as we move forward, I think you're likely to see us continue in that 60% to 65% range as we accelerate revenue over time. And as we talked about in our 2022 plan, we saw gross margins were around 63% or so, obviously predicated on a volume level of about $3.5 billion. So that gives you a sense of kind of where we're at from here to there moving forward. And I feel pretty good about our ability to achieve that given the investments we've made that are still -- I think we're in a good position to deliver against that. I don't think we have to go and make incremental investments in terms of the capacity, the hard asset capacity we have to execute to those business levels.
Chris Caso: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. One short-term question on your March quarter guidance. Just the Foundry/Logic, I think you are guiding for 73% of the mix to be Foundry/Logic. That is -- I think, implies at least in a mid-single-digit type decline. We haven't seen a decline in that business in a while. And I'm just trying to understand how that reconciles with your comment about end-to-demand being strong in the short-term.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I'm taking a look at it. I don't think it -- it doesn't look like it changes all that much. So I think it's -- given the overall revenue guidance is what it was, I think for semi-PC systems, I mean, we'll see how the quarter ends up. And we do have business that isn't, that's infrastructure business, for example, that doesn't show up in those percentages. So when I look at the businesses that the semiconductor customers, it's pretty consistent, so I don't think it'll change a little bit. But as we talked about, I think Memory overall is a higher percentage of the mix in 2025 than it was in 2024.
Srini Pajjuri: Okay, got it.
Richard Wallace: If there were some other customers non-N2, N3 that showed up in December that aren't showing up.
Srini Pajjuri: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Then I guess as we go through the year, obviously N2 is going to be relatively strong. Do you still have, I guess, material contribution or are you still expecting material contribution from N3 or is it at a minimal level? And then I guess, just to follow-up to that, how does the, I guess, PC intensity change as you go from N3 to N2? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes, so most of the focus in terms of new investment is on 2 nanometer. There's still some incremental investment that's happening, Srini, but the vast majority of it is 2 nanometer centric. Obviously, there's packaging investment that's also happening. And I mentioned it earlier, yes [indiscernible] been over the last couple quarters or so, I've said that at N3 versus N2, at N2, we thought we were about 75 basis points higher in terms of KLA's share of WFE. I think that we're likely higher than that's probably 90-ish to -- 90-ish basis points, maybe 100 basis points so trending in the right direction for sure.
Srini Pajjuri: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Brian Chin: Good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Yes, I was just curious, in terms of Logic/Foundry chipmakers that are at the leading edge, but they've been expanding capacity aggressively, can you comment on the magnitude of residual spending you still see with them besides R&D and technology development? Obviously, you're able to offset that for any driving there, [indiscernible] outgrowing WFE this year, but just curious if you had any sort of commentary around that.
Richard Wallace: Are you saying -- I'm sorry, you said one that aren't at the leading edge?
Brian Chin: At the leading edge, but not expanding capacity aggressively. That's kind of one guy doing that. But in terms of the other ones, you're sort of on the pace, or maybe -- on the pace, but not just not doing out aggressively. Maybe some sense of the signal spending engagement you still have with them.
Richard Wallace: So let's say we derisked that in our '25 plan.
Brian Chin: Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe just caring for that last question, how about the process control intensity going from 2 nanometer [indiscernible] around to 16A? Because I think they're kind of meant to be somewhat closely coupled to some degree.
Richard Wallace: Yes, we're a little early on that one. So I'd like to, before we start making comments, actually shifting the support to that activity in a way to actually model it. One of the things, obviously, we've seen over the course of the last several nodes for intensity reasons, but also for share, is that because of the design start environment, limiting reuse, customers are managing a much more dynamic design environment. You now have more designs that are driving leading edge RAMS. All these things have been positive factors, and then there's a share element as well. This fundamental, I think, shift moving forward in the composition of semiconductor revenue to larger, higher value die [indiscernible] density is very problematic. I think plays to growing opportunities for process control. We have to execute on our programs to be able to deliver the right solutions for customers to solve their problems and solve the right problems at scale to production. But I think if we execute in our own business, it does create an opportunity for us to see continued tailwinds in this area.
Bren Higgins: Yes, and let me give a little more perspective too, because we've actually -- usually, if the spending is done in a node, that process control intensity is kind of set. But what we've seen happen is when we have new solutions that find new [indiscernible] problems that are yield impacting, we've seen some back porting of that. So in other words, you might see some systems going into prior nodes, which actually drives those intensities up the prior node, which is the new baseline to go forward. So we feel -- we think part of the outperform is the fact that we're actually have more solutions that solve the problems. We've always had more opportunities than we've had answers for in terms of customers trying to figure out how to learn quicker and adopt new technologies, but our technologies are really coming together in a way that we think there's both share but also it drives adoption simply because we're solving more problems. So when we look at what we're seeing for N2, we feel pretty good about the potential to help our customers ramp those nodes and that'll be a basis on which to build going forward. For example, a lot of people didn't model early on the reticle verification on wafer, the print check that we're using for Gen 5. That's essentially a new application. Once people valued that, then they might even go back and back port some of that capability when there's yield opportunity. So we felt pretty good about where we are in terms of driving overall intensity, and that'll be part of the message we share at our Investor Day is how we see that going forward, which will include the node you talked about.
Brian Chin: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.
Charles Shi: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So I think that you guys don't want to exclusively call out the direction for the second half in terms of the growth relative to the first half of the year. But it sounds like the base case assumption from you guys is that you're probably going to be around that $3 billion per quarter level, maybe throughout the year. Maybe some of that is contingent upon whether you can get some export licenses for that $500 billion impact from the latest export control. But is there any other swing factors that you probably don't have a conclusion yet, but that could support some of the second half growth? Is there anything that you haven't mentioned?
Bren Higgins: Well, with licenses, as we said earlier, we haven't built that into the plan. And so we'll see how that plays out. And I think, the stabilizing around current levels as we look forward, it seems like we're operating around this level. And as we go beyond the middle of the year, we'll see what happens. We mentioned earlier about derisking some opportunities. And so we'll see how those potentially play out around certain customers, but that could be a swing factor as well. And I think that back to what we said about certain parts of the market we've been a little bit more cautious on. We'll see if there's more upside in China. I think we've tried to derisk that relative to the levels of investment we've seen over the last couple of years, but we'll see how that plays out as we move forward. But I think we’re -- for now it feels like around the current levels is the best that I can do from a guidance point of view.
Charles Shi: Thanks, Bren. Maybe a quick follow-up. What's the expectation for China revenue contribution into March quarter?
Bren Higgins: It will come down as a percent, to be in high 20s. We'll see. We'll see what ends up revenuing, right, because you've got different rev-rec policy issues from whether it's a new customer and a new fab versus an established customer. So that could either accelerate revenue to revenue shipment or extend it to an acceptance process. So we'll see how things play out. But in general, I would expect it to drop from the 35% level, probably into the high 20s, maybe 30 at the highest.
Charles Shi: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Rick, the question on foundry concentration comes a lot with investors. Obviously, you guys are doing very well with your top foundry customer on N2 and gate all around, and there is [indiscernible] in Japan that's kind of ramping this year. How are you guys leaning into the two struggling foundries this year if that poses a risk to your business?
Richard Wallace: I'm sorry, say it again, how are we dealing with …?
Atif Malik: How are you guys leaning into the two struggling foundries and what impact that could have both this year and [indiscernible] years in terms of your exposure?
Richard Wallace: Well, we're -- we obviously work with all our customers and so if there's a way for us to add value, we're doing that. I think the bulk of the stated CapEx number pretty clearly head towards the direction of biggest player in the market in terms of investment, but the others, we engage. I mean, certainly everyone that we work with wants to improve their ramp up time of new technology and improve their yield. And so, of course, we're doing that, but that's not where the bulk of the business is these days. So I don't see a huge difference in terms of how we think we're engaging now relative to how we were in the past. It's just the dynamics have shifted much more toward the leader who's further ahead now than they've been in quite a while.
Atif Malik: Fair enough. And Bren, on the $500 million restrictions impact, can you give some color? Were those like trailing edge logic projects or was it a DRAM contribution in those sales?
Bren Higgins: Yes, most of it was logic. Yes, very little --in fact all of that was logic. I mean, very little that was memory.
Atif Malik: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you very much and thank you everybody for your time and your attention. We know how busy today is and this week is, so we appreciate it. We'll be speaking with you all very soon. I'll turn it back now to the operator for any closing instructions.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the KLA Corporation December quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2025 Q1  (2024-10-30 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon everyone. My name is Bo, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation's September Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin Kessel: Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the September 2024 results and the December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on ir.kla.com along with the supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP basis, unless otherwise specified, all full year references we make are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosure of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on our call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will start with some introductory comments, followed by Bren with financial highlights and our outlook. Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace, I wanted to provide a save the date for our 2025 Investor Day. It will be held on the morning of June 18th, 2025 in New York City at the NASDAQ market site. We will provide more details closer to the event. Now, over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. KLA September quarter exhibited strengthening customer demand and solid execution by our global team. Results exceeded expectations and delivered continued relative outperformance with revenue of $2.84 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7.33, and GAAP diluted EPS of $7.01. All results came in at the upper end of their guidance ranges. As expected, we are encouraged by the signs of the strengthening leading-edge logic and memory environment for our top customers and we remain confident in our plan for steady improvement and continued growth in 2025. Quarter saw a number of highlights, including strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. In foundry logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies, and slowly rising capital intensity continued to be a long-term secular tailwind. In memory, technology development investments supporting AI and high-bandwidth memory and an improving supply-demand environment are positioning memory makers return to growth for the wafer fab equipment industry in 2025. This quarter continued to demonstrate growing customer adoption of KLA's advanced packaging portfolio and we remain confident that revenue in this category will exceed $500 million in CY 2024 and continue to grow in CY 2025. We also continue to see AI as an important driver and enabler of our business. Growth in demand for AI CHIPS supports rising process control intensity, which benefits KLA meaningfully. Additionally, KLA was an early adopter in using and incorporating AI into our products and designing our computer architecture to leverage GPUs. KLA's future product enhancements will leverage AI to improve the performance and customer cost of ownership of our leading-edge systems. Daily service business grew to $644 million in the September quarter, up 5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, making this the 49th consecutive quarter of growth on a year-over-year basis. Finally, the September quarter was strong from a cash flow cash flow and capital returns perspective. Quarterly free cash flow was $935 million. Over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $3.2 billion, free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. Total capital return in the September quarter was $765 million, comprised of $567 million in share repurchases and $198 million in dividends. Total capital return over the past 12 months was $2.6 billion. We are confident the KLA operating model positions the company well for sustainable outperformance relative to the industry over the long run. I will now pass the call over to Bren to cover financial highlights and our outlook.
Bren Higgins: Thanks Rick. KLA September quarter results demonstrate market leadership, combined with the consistent execution and dedication of our global team. Quarterly revenue was $2.84 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.75 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.33 and GAAP diluted EPS was $7.01, both above the respective guidance midpoints. Gross margin was 61.2%, slightly below the midpoint of the guidance range as the systems product mix was modestly weaker than expected. Operating expenses were $560 million, Operating expenses were comprised of $322 million in R&D and $238 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41.5%. Other income and expense debt was a $41 million expense with the downside from guidance attributed to the mark-to-market effect of the strategic supply investment. The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $988 million, GAAP net income was $946 million, cash flow from operations was $995 million, and free cash flow was $935 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets, major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Our debt levels are expected to decline in the December quarter as the company retires its November 2024 bonds at maturity. Moving to our outlook. In the near-term, the industry outlook remains positive for our business. Our quarter-to-quarter performance is also consistent with the views we articulated at the beginning of the year. For calendar 2024, supported by recent customer announcements, our expectation is for the WFE market to increase modestly from the mid to the high $90 billion range for the calendar year based on our internal analysis of reported results and guidance across our peers and customers. Our perspective on calendar 2025 expectations is mostly unchanged from what we articulated last quarter. While we will not be overly specific on expectations for next calendar year until we report in January, we do continue to expect another year of growth, fueled principally by growth and investment in both leading-edge foundry, logic and memory, mostly DRAM, offset by lower China demand as customers absorb the equipment investments made over the past couple of years. Given KLA's business momentum, market share opportunities, and higher expected process control intensity at leading edge across all segments, we are confident we can maintain our relative WFE market outperformance in calendar 2025. KLA's December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.95 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and memory is expected to be approximately 24%, semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 76% of the segment mix and NAND, remaining 24%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point or up 30 basis points sequentially at the midpoint on slightly higher revenue and more favorable product mix expectations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the December quarter to be approximately $580 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $15 million in incremental quarterly spend and operating expenses over the next several quarters, supported by our product development road map requirements, revenue growth expectations, and further balanced against our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage business model over the long run. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense debt of approximately $33 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $7.45, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS $7.75 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 134 million shares. In conclusion, we are guiding to our third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and improving market demand at the leading edge and expect annual growth to continue in calendar 2025. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that addresses customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer term relevancy and growth expectations. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence for what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of semiconductor scaling leads to increasing complexity and new technologies that have strengthened our confidence in the rising importance of process control for enabling new technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results and process integration at Fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across high-volume manufacturing environment with high semiconductor device design mix. In addition, our service business continues to increase its relevance of system lifetime increases and customer expectations for increased tool availability and performance is a growing long-term tailwind. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook and industry demand trends favoring KLA are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is well positioned and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are very promising. That concludes our prepared remarks. Let's begin the Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen--
Kevin Kessel: Sorry, go ahead, operator. I was just going to say please provide the instructions.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you Mr. Kessel. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Vivek Arya of Bank of America.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I'm curious, there's a lot of excitement about the leading edge, but how do we square back to the fact that only the leading foundry of payers to want to increase spending, but the next two want to cut spending. So, is this TSMC spending good enough to drive up leading-edge investments by the double-digit or so pace that everyone is looking for? I was just curious, this excitement, is it broad-based? Or is it just based on one foundry's desire to increase spending?
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Vivek, for the question. It's not a foundry question. It's a customer of the foundries question. I think they would obviously -- if there were more suppliers of leading edge, I think that the business would be spread across them. But right now, there's one supplier in the leading edge. And what they're seeing is significant demand above as they indicated in their call, what they anticipated. And a bit of the -- we anticipated 2-nanometer demand to be strong, but the fact that there's additional demand for 3-nanometer lead us to some pretty robust forecast through the rest of this year for the bookings and also into 2025. So, I don't think it's a function of the number of players, I think it's a demand driver. And as you know, it's across a number of players because it's not just in support. I mean, AI is the fastest-growing segment, and that's both for training chips, but also inference trips, and that's really driving this additional demand that we're seeing.
Bren Higgins: And Vivek, the other thing I would add is severely close to our customers, and they all approach process control in different ways. But generally, we want to make sure that we're collaborating and close enough to them that we have a pretty good understanding of the overall demand picture. So, we think that in terms of assessing what each customer is doing in terms of the demand that they're going to satisfy that Rick articulated, we feel good that that we have our supply is supporting that aligned with that demand expectation.
Vivek Arya: That's very helpful. And for my follow-up, a question on your China exposure, about 42% in September. Curious what you are expecting or what's baked in for December? And -- maybe just the broader question is, can you maybe dissect what the exposure is in China? How much is product services? How much is resilient or how much might be exposed to any potential restrictions or overbid? Just how do you think about China for the next several quarters, whether it's on an absolute basis or whether it's on a percentage of sales basis? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Well, Vivek, understanding China right now this year, it's important to keep in context what happened in 2022 and 2023 and 2024, right? So, if you go back to 2022, we took a lot of orders for greenfield projects and had supply constraints and strong demand from our other non-China customers that effectively limited what we were able to produce in 2022, and we focused on our more strategic long-standing customers. And as we moved into 2023 and 2024, because a lot of that activity was greenfield, it wasn't necessarily being put in place to react to supply and demand dynamics. It was basically new fabs that were starting up. And so while it was funding available, those customers were able to step in and fill a void in 2023 and 2024 that came from our other customers pulling back pretty meaningfully. So, as we look at 2022, so it's been at elevated levels for a couple of years. If we look at the fourth quarter, as I said before, I thought we would see the percent come down. And it looks like it is coming down to somewhere in the mid-30s for the fourth quarter. And then so if you look at 2024, it's been elevated into the low 40s as a percent. And so when we look into next year, expecting some digestion next year, I would expect that to drop somewhere down to around 30% plus or minus a couple of points or so moving forward. I'm not going to get into the various aspects of the mix from a service other than saying, just from a service point of view, it's a less mature market. So, service is a lower percentage than sort of at corporate average percent as a percent of revenue. So, hopefully, that's helpful. But that's all I'll say on that front. As it relates to export controls, we've been getting this question for over a year now in terms of when and if and how much. And so I don't want to speculate on the hypotheticals that are out there and how to think about it. So, once we have clarity, if something happens, we'll assess the impact, and we'll have more to share with you. But for now, I don't want to speculate on anything more than that.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Harlan Sur at JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. On your qualitative comments on the 2025 view, right, you're calling out growth for next year. You said not much change relative to your new 90 days ago. I assume that in terms of maybe total dollar spending, you did call out lower China revenues next year, right, versus your view on stable previously. So, should we interpret the downshift in China as being more than offset by incrementally better spending on advanced foundry and logic and memory on the strong demand trends that Rick articulated earlier?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think we started with -- you just go back to what we said a quarter ago that a view of stability, maybe it was going to be up a little bit, down a little bit, but not as clear. I think where we sit today, I would expect that it will be down some, and we think it's being offset by the leading-edge demand that Rick referred to. So, overall, our views on 2025 haven't really changed.
Richard Wallace: Yes. I mean, Harlan, if you think about at the exit rate that we're talking about for Q4 -- that is -- if you keep that rate for 2025, that's a higher number. So, you could have China be at a similar dollar level but a lower percentage.
Harlan Sur: Got it. And then on your process control business, right? If I look at wafer inspection and patterning and metrology, right, up 10% year-over-year first nine months versus a year ago, now within this, inspection is up 18% year-over-year. So very, very strong way for the first nine months of this calendar year. Patterning, metrology, down about 5% right over that same period of time. But -- looking into next year, right, given the patterning and metrology sort of intensity increases on things like gate all around, backside power distribution, advanced memory, like would you anticipate your patterning/metrology business to see an acceleration of growth as we move into next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes, that's our current view. Metrology is very closely linked to process tool purchases because you're monitoring the films, you're monitoring overlay and so on. So, patterning tends to scale up and down with more capacity investments. I think given expectations for design starts, you're also going to see the reticle part of the business increase next year as well. So, I would expect that we'll see growth in metrology and reticle inspection into next year. What's been driving inspection is a lot of this activity given some of the yield challenges that customers have been facing, obviously, into starting to pick up here in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, in advanced packaging, where we've seen an inflection of growth in our inspection offerings for that part of the market as well. So, that's been a driver for some of the incremental growth of inspection relative to patterning.
Richard Wallace: Yes. One other thing, Harlan. I think if you look at capacity constraints that we were more gated on lead-times of subsystems such as optics for the inspection business. Didn't really have that phenomena in metrology, so those tend to flex as Bren said more with production. So, we still have good backlog when it comes to the BBP platforms. and an increasing demand environment for us. So, we're also seeing additional capacity coming on to support the growth in 2025, so that, that will allow the BBP product lines to grow.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next now to Joe Quatrochi at Wells Fargo.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering I'm 2-nanometers as you think about just the capital intensity process control. Is there any color that you can really share there and how we think about sample rates to 3-nanometer?
Richard Wallace: Sure. What we're seeing right now is what we expected on to and what we're seeing a little bit on 3 is there's more process the window -- process windows are being squeezed even further. So, there are more inspection points being added. So, when we think about how many steps and the places that people are inspecting, those are going up. So, we have a run part analysis of what it looks like and the tools that it will take. What happens is, let's say, you go from 3 to 2, you might not dramatically increase the number of EUV layers, for example, but there is some increase and associated with that are more places where you have to sample. So, initially, when you're in debug, you have a higher number, but then you see -- you're looking at different defects, so you might even be looking at higher sensitivity settings, which means you need more capacity to support it. So, we haven't fully quantified because when we work with our customers on that, we're actually looking for efficiency. So, you debug and then you see what is left that I have to sample at a higher frequency to be able to ensure process stability during ramp in production. But the initial expectations are -- and what we're seeing is that 2 nanometers will be higher, more sampling at higher levels with more systems with more configurations, driving higher process control intensity, and that's the trend that we're seeing. The other thing is, as Bren mentioned, because they're more -- if you think about what's coming, there are going to be more designs at these advanced nodes than we maybe a few years ago, might have imagined, there's higher variability, so higher mix and mix drives a need for more sampling as well.
Bren Higgins: So, Joe, on architectures. When architectures change, it tends to drive process control higher, we saw that with FinFET, if you go back to the last local high of process control intensity or KLA share of WFE. So, as we transition here to a new architecture, it will create not only are there other additional patterning requirements from a metrology point of view, more layers deposited and that creates opportunities for us on the film measurement side, you also have new defect mechanisms because of the nature of the structure. So, you have these varying defects, where there's residue that's left over, that's very hard to inspect. And so we've introduced new capability for that very two [ph] or gate all around specific defect type. And so there's an increment of opportunity there beyond what we would normally expect to see in a node to node transition. So, there's a lot of opportunity out there. And if we can execute, we feel very encouraged by what's in front of us.
Joe Quatrochi: Well, that's helpful detail. As a follow-up, I think in the past, you guys try to help us how to think about like growth half-on-half, second half versus first half? And I guess as we look into the first half of 2025, should we be thinking about similar kind of levels half-on-half growth as we've seen kind of second half versus first half in 2024, how should we think about that?
Bren Higgins: Well, I would say to Rick's earlier point, that based on our expectations into Q1, we see a pretty stable environment from the current run rates as we move forward. So, I won't get into the full half. At this point, we'll have a lot more to say about our views on 2025 when we report out for the December quarter and January. But certainly, as we look at the March quarter today, I feel very good about the overall stability and the run rate levels of the business.
Joe Quatrochi: Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next now to C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe to follow-up on that last question and your comment about stability into March. I believe 2 is moving into HVM in Q1. And you talked about expected strength from advanced packaging. And when I look at your foundry logic business in the current quarter, where Taiwan actually fell sequentially. It looks like you're seeing some good business from rapidness and mass currently Intel. So, -- can you speak to perhaps the breadth of foundry logic that you're seeing early 2025. And I would think that would be a complete offset to a slowdown in China. Would love to hear your thoughts?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I would expect, given the -- I'll say this, just given the normal ramp schedule that our leading foundry customer executes against -- but normally, you'd start to see those will start to ship in volume in the first part of the year.
C.J. Muse: Okay, great. And then a gross margin question for you. It looks like semi process control gross margins dropped maybe 150 bps sequentially in September and you attribute that to mix. So, as we look forward, how we should think about that -- those margins kind of normalizing? And what kind of run rate should we remodel into and through 2025?
Bren Higgins: Yes, mix is always a factor, C.J. for me. So, I would say that normally, our incremental margin model suggests about a 60% to 65% incremental. The mix variability can cause movement across quarters. But if you look at it over longer periods of time, it tends to stick pretty closely to that. The packaging opportunities have been great opportunities from a growth point of view. But currently, we're selling some lower end systems into that part of the market. So, it is affecting the mix bit, although we're encouraged about the trend there for the need for more capability moving forward. So, it's those kinds of issues. I would say that we're operating here in this, I'll call it, 61.5% range. And at current run rates, as we sort of project out into next year, I think we're likely to be north of that route versus south of that as we move forward. That's probably the best I can do.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll go next now to Tom O'Malley at Barclays.
Tom O'Malley: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask specifically on the NAND market. So, you guys are coming off a really low base in September, but there's a bit of a debate right now if you look out into calendar year 2025 about where normal capacity is for historical NAND and where you're moving potentially to technology transitions and what that means from an equipment perspective? So, I guess maybe the broader question is, what are you seeing in the NAND market? Are you seeing intensity kind of pick up there? Are you seeing customers look to expand lines? Or are you seeing that technology upgrade as well? Just any comments on what is driving that NAND growth into next year? And just your take on the market would be the first one?
Bren Higgins: Well, at a pretty low base. So, as we think about next year, we would expect some incremental investment next year, but again, off of a very low base. Mostly, what we're seeing is utilization rates get better. We're seeing our customers financial performance, improving inventory levels, improving things like that. So we think that translates into some investment into next year. But we don't see it really growing a lot on an absolute dollar basis, but it is operating are coming off a very low level. So, I think we're optimistic on some incremental business there as we move into next year.
Richard Wallace: Yes, the one technology trend that will help process control intensity for NAND is the wafer-to-wafer bonding. But other than that, we're not really pushing the technology compared to DRAM or logic.
Tom O'Malley: Got you. Super helpful. And then the second is just on the advanced packaging side. You guys spent a decent amount of time on the last call talking on the topic and I think increasingly, you're seeing the move to hybrid bonding kind of accelerate. So, others are kind of saying 2026 timeframe. But are you seeing some opportunities in 2025? And -- could you just try to shape like the size of that business today and some of the opportunities that you're kind of reaching down. Some of your smaller competitors are kind of talking about seeing you in some of those areas already, but -- any comments there would be helpful as well? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes, you have development activity there, but we don't expect any move from a production point of view to the hybrid bonding as it relates to high-bandwidth memory until probably at least into the 2026, 2027 timeframe. So, what's really driving that part of the business for us is mostly on the logic side, although we're encouraged by some of the trends we're seeing in memory in terms of opportunity. HBM devices themselves create higher process control opportunities because not only do you have the silicon trade in terms of bits per wafer, if you will. But you also have higher reliability requirements. You had the logic circuitry that has to be processed go stack the die. So, there's a lot of opportunities within that that we are encouraged by as we move forward.
Richard Wallace: So, one of the truisms in our business for inspection metrology is what is the cost of the inspection at any step relative to the cost of the best step. And what I mean by that is if you go back in time and they were making wafers for solar, we never saw there being much opportunity because the cost of the wafer is just not very high. so it couldn't support much inspection. You go to the other end of that and you have the cost of an EUV reticle is so high the cost of failure is so high, there's a lot of money spent on the inspection. The biggest dynamic that changed in advanced packaging is the relative cost of that step and the fact that the cost can support a much higher level and a need for a much higher level of inspection capability. So, our view is we did not go down to that market. That market came to us because it got much more challenging. And the need for higher level inspection, if you think about HBM and you think about what's at risk for our customers. So, they recognize that and they're investing much more heavily to ensure that those steps are clean because the cost of failure there is so high. And that's a big part of what's driving capital intensity and our product portfolio has moved to some of those dynamics. And those will play out over the next several years, but we're already seeing early evidence of that. And the earliest indication of that was when our customers started talking to us about bringing in our front-end tools into the back end because of these challenges.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Srini Pajjuri at Raymond James.
Srini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi guys. So, my question is on M3 versus M2 demand. I know you said both of them were strong. I'm just wondering, in terms of the near-term upside you're seeing -- is that more coming from M3? And if so, just curious if M2 is also tracking in line with your original expectations?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I would say that what we've seen over the course of the second half of this year has been more M3 upside. We're starting to see billing investment with some shipments this quarter for M2. And most of what's driving next year is very M2-centric.
Srini Pajjuri: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then maybe you can speak to the visibility, especially as China comes down next year. I'm just wondering if that has any impact on your bookings and RPO just in general, your level of visibility as we go forward?
Bren Higgins: Well, so the RPO has flattened out we'll report and you'll see the specifics on it, but it was more or less flat quarter-on-quarter expected probably to a little bit next quarter or for the -- in the December quarter. So, I would say that, in general, lead times have generally been coming in. Some of that has been, as Rick mentioned earlier, new supply or new supply capability so we can actually start to ship some tools that we've had some supply constraints relative to the demand. It really -- I would say that as you start to see some of the greenfield projects will cause some of that to pull in, right? It's greenfield gets pulled back as some of the digestions happening. We're waiting for second round on some of those projects that the need to get into the queue earlier is less urgent. Although when you have new customers, they want to show commitment and so they typically will and want to sure delivery time. So, they'll typically try to give us orders and make sure we're planning for them further ahead. So, I would say, in general, lead-times are generally pulling in, and we've seen the RPO tick down, but now it looks like it's starting to turn around a bit, see how that progresses as we move through the rest of this quarter and into next year.
Srini Pajjuri: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Krish Sankar at TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First of all, I want to clarify something, Bren. You mentioned that China could go from 40% to 30% of sales next year, but dollar value remains the same. A, is that true? If so, then your overall revenue should still grow pretty strongly compared to what WFE is expected to be. I'm just trying to figure out how to think about those two metrics?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think it's a trend down. Look, we'll see how the year plays out. But I would expect it could be the same. It could be a little bit less. I think what we were trying to say earlier is that investment levels have been pretty stable. So, we'll see how it plays out. It's a little bit difficult to see into the second half of the 2025 from here. So, I was just trying to give you some sense of directionally where things are moving as we see next year from percent of the overall.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. And then just to clarify one other thing. I know you kind of mentioned about how the foundry demand is improving in the leading edge, which kind of makes a ton of sense also from China. And then -- on the DRAM side, I think as mentioned in the past, process control incentives going up from 10% to 11%. Is that helping you next year or is most of it already baked in this year?
Bren Higgins: No, I think it's helping. There's a lot of momentum from certain customers, particularly as it relates to advanced DRAM and high-bandwidth memory that's creating opportunities for us. So, we're encouraged with -- and as we said earlier, I said before, is I'm encouraged by an expectation to see more DRAM investment next year and expect to see stronger relevance of KLA and process control in that ramp. So, what -- if I go back to my comment about the cost of the semiconductor and the value of inspection. If you think about this trend for AI, it's definitely playing out in DRAM and in packaging, right? So, the DRAM for HBM is a more expensive technology. It's more critical, it's larger die. These are wafers that are going to have more EUV and they also have less redundancy in them. So, the combination of those factors is what will drive our customers to increase their intensity around process control. Just EUV is a good example of a pretty significant application we have with our Gen 5 is print check on EUV and that dedication to having -- using a Gen 5 to verify a reticle as it prints, has been part of the driver of the of the success BBP. So, if you think about trends overall, we don't quite know how it's going to play out for advanced DRAM, but the trends are very positive at this point.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks Rick, thanks Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Great. Thank you. On the topic of export controls, you sort of said you don't want to speculate until we hear it. I guess I'm just -- how do you expect that to get conveyed? Have you had preliminary conversations it sounds like there might be more of an entity list focused this time around where you get surprised? And when you're giving a framework for next year, and as we had a much lower framework, is how much of that is informed by what you're hearing that they might do versus just kind of I guess, work at this point?
Richard Wallace: Well, so if you go back to the 2000 -- two years ago, there was some notice, but I think for the government itself, they have their own process, which involves multiple number of players. There's not one person or one group that decides. They have to go through a reconciliation across their own agencies and also when they're trying to do multilateral, they're talking to other places. So, I think truly nothing is decided until it's announced. And we don't get much heads up on when that's actually going to happen. So, that's why we keep saying we don't know, we can't speculate. There's plenty that's been written -- but if you read all that's been written, this thing would have happened 4 times in the last nine months, right? So, clearly, something is causing it to not get decided. And so we're not going to speculate on when it does. When it comes to what our peer companies have said, I think our forecast for 2025 hasn't changed, and it's much more in line with where others are now than what it was. So, our view has not changed. Nothing about our forecast for next year has really changed in the last several months as we talk to our customers and we envision what kind of investment environment there's going to be.
Joseph Moore: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then within your China business, I know you had kind of catch-up on the DRAM side that were causing DRAM to be elevated. My perception is that fact [Technical Difficulty] -- is it more driven by foundry at this point?
Bren Higgins: You started to break up there a little bit, Joe. But yes, I think what you were asking about was DRAM memory moving forward versus foundry logic. And yes, there was some catch-up investment that happened. I would expect less memory, memory to be down more in terms of the overall, I think it's going to be down as parts of the market we don't have access to, but in general, in terms of our business, I would expect foundry logic to modestly adjust, but still to be fairly strong. And I think infrastructure more or less continues, but that's more of a radical statement than a wafer statement.
Joseph Moore: Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Charles Shi of Needham.
Charles Shi: My first question. I remember a quarter ago, you talked about not just the 3-nanometer for second half this year but also next year, but we'll look at all the headlines about 2 out of your 3-nanometer customers that doesn't look like there is 3-nanometer upside from done, but the one large customer that actually the leading one they did not rule out more of the 5- to 3-nanometer conversion or even for next year. So, my question really is, are you still seeing the 3-nanometer upside for 2025 given the current visibility here?
Bren Higgins: So we had this question earlier in the call. But yes, 3-nanometer continues to be strong. And as we said earlier, we would expect 2-nanometer to be a big driver into next year, but there's still a 3-nanometer activity that is been stronger than we anticipated six months ago.
Charles Shi: Got it. The other thing I want to ask you to make a clarification or maybe provide some color, your reported North America revenue for the September quarter seems like pretty high. I go back probably the last seven, eight years, it looks like it's probably the highest number of revenue you get from North America. Might if you provide some color on what's driving that big uptick in the September quarter?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So, it was stronger and it's more leading edge-centric, I'll say that.
Charles Shi: Thanks.
Operator: We'll go next now to Atif Malik at Citi.
Atif Malik: Thank you for taking my questions. First, on China, is it possible to understand how big your wafer and reticle inspection business in China because I believe that business is a bit different from your peers that are facing maybe restrictions?
Bren Higgins: Yes, it is -- Atif, it is different, right? We're exposed to those investments. We haven't disclosed the actual amount, though. But I would say, over the last couple of years, I would say it's been somewhere between 25% and 35% of our China systems business. So, it's decent, but the preponderance, obviously, is our semiconductor customers.
Atif Malik: Understand. And then, Bren, on the services business, given the scenario of a China demand coming down like you laid out, will there be an impact on your services growth expectations of 12% to 14% longer term?
Bren Higgins: Well, we're pretty bullish on service and service opportunity, and we're trending closer to the top end of that range than the bottom end. We're seeing really dynamic trends in terms of useful life and new value offerings that we have within our service model that is driving incremental service demand. And of course, at the shipment levels, the new tools going out, high conversion rates, ASPs generally are higher, which drives contract pricing growth. That's part of it, but also the extending useful life. So, as we said before, it's a high mix, high complexity, relatively low-volume business. There's not a lot of redundancy. Customers have very high uptime expectations and so they run the tools at very high levels. They have matching requirements across the tools. So, these tools are the eyes and ears in the fab. And as a result of that, customers ensure that they're operating and so that drives our service model that drives the contract stream, which is 75% plus of revenue. And yes, there are dynamics around FX, depending on some service businesses priced in local currencies that can affect the revenue line. And if you did have control, those controls affect service opportunities there. But net-net, we still feel very comfortable with our long-term model and feel like we're trending towards the high end of the model versus the low end.
Atif Malik: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Timothy Arcuri at UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Rick, I just want to be kind of clear about how much handicapping you're doing for the export control. It sounds to me like you're not really handicapping much at all, and you're just sort of waiting for it to get announced and once it gets announced, then it will impact your numbers as does. Is that fair? Because Lam was pretty explosive that they are. They have a base assumption as to what it's going to look like, and that's and that's handicapping our guidance. Is that not the case for you? Or are you making a base assumption for the guidance as to what the exports will look like?
Bren Higgins: Well, so Tim, I'll take the first part. So, as it relates to guidance, and how we're thinking about the fourth quarter, we have a guidance range. And I would say that as we contemplate all the scenarios, and of course, we have energy issues in terms of the size of our tools and so on. From an ASP point of view as we contemplate all the various scenarios, we're comfortable with the guidance range that we provided for the quarter. As it pertains to long-term impact of something that may or may not happen, we'll have to assess what it means in terms of what we have in backlog, what the forecast, how do we look at those customers and their investment plans and so on. So, we won't have a detailed information until something happens, if it happens. But as far as it relates to near-term, guidance, I think we feel comfortable with the guidance range we provided.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, Bren. Thanks. Then I guess just math on next year. So, you grew revenue like mid-30s this year for your China revenue, it's up mid-30s. Of your films tiers, one grew 20%, the other one is barely going to be up. And I think China WP's up about 20% this year. So, you're up a lot more than what you're -- so almost peers are. So, it doesn't matter what I think China WFE is. But when you think about how fast you grew China versus your peers, do you think there's any pull forward of your China spending maybe because there's no alternative tool that's available from a mastic Chinese company. So, why not to some degree stockpile your tools and move them around as these new entities came up consolidate. So, I'm just wondering if you think that the hangover for you could be a little more severe than your peers? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Tim, there's different buying patterns in terms of timing. If you look at 2023, I think we probably -- our China business undergrew our peers. So, if you if you look at any one year in isolation, it might drive you to a conclusion, not really accurate. I mean I think look at 2023 and 2024, I think the general activity levels of investment have been, I think, relatively consistent across most companies that have a broader period of time. Process control tends to particularly in greenfield probably get adopted more heavily early on. Because customers are monitoring very, very closely, doing a lot of sampling. So, as wafer starts start to grow, then less process control tends to diminish a bit. So, there's probably some timing in terms of how they buy overall. And in 2025, given where we are today, and we'll see what overall WFE, but to the earlier comments, we do expect some digestion in 2025.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, Bren, thank you.
Operator: We'll go next now to Toshiya Hari at Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to get your thoughts on customer mix going into 2025 and any implications for margins. You mentioned China is down next year within leading-edge foundry and logic, TSMC obviously, share and growing share within WFE as well. So, does that -- or could that potentially pressure gross margins? I know your gross margin profile has been remarkably stable over many, many years, if not maybe decades. So, I doubt it, but we do get this question quite a bit from investors. So, curious how you're thinking about evolution in customer mix and implications for gross margins?
Bren Higgins: Yes. Our gross margins are not customer-dependent, it's more product specific. So, our margins don't vary across different customers. Obviously, customers that buy more tend to get volume-related incentives. But beyond obvious volume incentives, there isn't any real difference between customers or regions in terms of overall margin. Now, they all buy process control differently and at different strategies. And so all of our products carry different margins, they're not all the same. So, that's one of the product mix factors that tends to drive some variability there. But yes, it's more about products than customers or regions.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you. And then as a quick follow-up, another one on China. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more context by application or customer type. I know you service a broader range of customers relative to some of your process tool peers. Customer groups like match shops, wafer suppliers more on the infrastructure side. I'm curious what percentage of total China those guys account for this year? And as you look forward into 2025, what kind of trends are you expecting? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes. Earlier on the call, I mentioned percentage is probably somewhere in the 25%, maybe as high as 30% a given year. But in general, from an infrastructure point of view, that's about the mix. And I would expect that to be mostly stable, but more reticle strict than wafer in 2025. So, that's there. I think we mentioned memory earlier. I think memory comes down meaningfully partly due to the investments that have happened, partly due to just the lack of market access to some memory investment for us. So, -- and then I think foundry and logic corrects, but doesn't correct all that much.
Toshiya Hari: Helpful. Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. We go next now to Chris Caso at Wolfe Research.
Chris Caso: Yes, hi. I guess the first question is on DRAM and kind of what you're thinking about for next year because it does sound like there's some divergence between different customer groups there. Most are expecting the China part of DRAM to be down pretty significantly. Can you give us a view of generally what you're seeing with regard to DRAM investment and kind of pinning from your customers as you go over next year and how that may have changed over the last quarter?
Bren Higgins: I would say it hasn't changed all that much. This year, it's been much more about our customers' business is getting better, their financial performance improving. And that some of the investment has been somewhat isolated. We mentioned China earlier as an example. We've seen utilization rates improve, which has been good for our service business. And we would expect as it relates to high in DRAM and supporting high bandwidth memory to see some incremental investment in next year. We'll have more to say from a quantitative point of view in terms of expectations around how much growth and how that translates back to KLA in the January call. But from just an overall context point of view, we expect to see a decent step-up in DRAM investment next year.
Chris Caso: Okay, great. My question is that some investors are starting to ask about. And there's generally implications of what happens if leading edge tends to consolidate more than it has already. And perhaps that could be just because when leading edge customers are just growing so much more quickly than the others. It's probably early to make that call right now. I bet some of your customers would disagree with that. But thinking about it now, what would the implications be if we saw more consolidation? Would that provide some pressure because just more suppliers than simply more suppliers and customers?
Richard Wallace: I think it would depend on the drivers. In other words, in a world where there was a single driver for the leading edge, say, take a microprocessor than -- and it had been made at multiple places, then you'd argue, sure, consolidation would be more efficient. What's interesting now is because there are so many advanced designs, the efficiency -- you need scale to have efficiency and they already have that scale. So, I don't think it changes that much. I do think you have some people still making investments to do leading edge, say, in Japan, for example. And there's -- that -- that -- they're hoping to get part of the market. Our assumption is it remains at about the efficiency and the way we measure that and model for it as we think about what is the capital efficiency or the intensity of capital and process control for that segment as we go forward. And we're not really modeling it to go up significantly because there's a lot of players at the leading edge. Truthfully, there haven't been. I mean, for years now, we've really had primarily one major player at the leading edge. And so that's for most of the volume. So, we're kind of already there. If that were to change, that might drive up intensity beyond what we're modeling more so than go the other way. Does that make sense?
Chris Caso: Yes. Yes, that’s helpful. Something we're thinking about. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question today. We'll take that now from Blayne Curtis of Jefferies.
Blayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in and I feel that would be the last question and giving you this one. But I was just kind of curious to your perspective, you're on in the three that kind of does give an outlook for the market. So, I appreciate that greatly. We have had a handful of companies already report, I think, generally, consensus is kind of double-digits for everybody, and I don't think people have brought them down below that. I was just kind of curious, as you assess the market, I know I guess I appreciate you trying to put something out there, but a low single-digit growth, it just seems low. So, I'm just kind of curious, one, I think your numbers are up double-digits. It seems like your tone would suggest that, that's maybe the right trajectory. So, I'm just kind of curious where that outlook came from. And I think in general, do people have it wrong, I guess?
Bren Higgins: I'm sorry, what period of time are you talking about?
Blayne Curtis: For 2025, all right? I mean the WFE forecast that you put out, I appreciate you putting it out, right? But you said high 90--
Bren Higgins: No, we haven't put one out Blayne. We provided an update to our 2024 view that we actually see 2024 in the high 90s versus the mid-90s, which is what we what we said three months ago. So, as it relates to 2025, we haven't actually put a number out there. The only thing we talked about is in reference to our own business in our views of current run rate a reasonable amount of stability here moving forward.
Blayne Curtis: I apologize. That was my mistake. I just want to ask on the other one on the China outlook. So, I thought you were talking about your kind of prospective end markets in China being down, I just want to make sure I heard you. I know you had a couple of questions on this. I apologize for the clarity there as well. But you said December down, I think you said 35% of revenue. So, it would be down as a dollar amount, but then you said kind of flat kind of for the rest of the year. And I thought I heard you say that then it still dropped as a percent of revenue, which is another way you can kind of back into, I guess, what you're seeing in growth. So, I was just trying to understand if that's the mechanics of what you said. And I guess that's another way you can kind of back into double-digit growth. I know you're trying to put it out there. I just want to understand what you said?
Richard Wallace: Yes. So maybe -- this is Rick, let me try to clarify our view. We said earlier in the year that we think we think one of the things we're doing is preparing for growth at the leading edge. That's where we are now. We think the growth in the next year is going to come from the leading edge. And that's both in memory as it pertains to high bandwidth and a lot of the work that's going on. It has to do with advanced packaging and it has to do with advanced logic foundry. The other business, such as that we've had, for example, in China, we don't know exactly, but that's not leading edge, that's a mature business. And we think it's too early to say. But when we look to 2025 and then look beyond to the model we had for 2026 or even what we'll start talking about 2030. We think we're getting back to the historical levels where leading edge is what's driving the growth, it's the largest percent of the business and the legacy will be a smaller percent. When exactly that happens, we don't know. But that's the trend that we're seeing. And what we're seeing is very good indications of strength in leading edge based on the design starts and based on the conversations with customers. In the last quarter, for first time in quite a long time, our leading-edge customers have been asking for acceleration, more systems than they'd originally planned for, and they want to make sure we can support them and install them that's what gives us the confidence that 2025 is going to be driven by investment in the leading edge.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks for that.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Blayne, and thank you, everybody, for your interest, for your time. We'll be following up with many of you in the following days. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for any concluding instructions.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Kessel. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the KLA Corporation September quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-07-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is David and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel : Welcome to our earnings call to discuss the June 2024 Results and the September Quarter Outlook. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market closed and available at ir.kla.com, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. All full year references are to calendar years. The earnings materials contain the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future Investor events, presentations, corporate governance information, and links to the SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosures of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. Let me turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. I will cover a few business highlights for this quarter. KLA's June quarter revenue, gross margin, and EPS were all above their respective guidance midpoints. The quarter played out mostly as expected with strong customer demand and solid company execution. We continue to see signs of a strengthening market environment for customers at the leading edge and remain confident in our plan for steady improvement throughout the remainder of this calendar year and into 2025. This quarter, KLA results returned to sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, demonstrating an improving industry environment. Foundry/logic, the continuation of scaling and incorporation of new technologies and slowly rising capital intensity continues to be a long-term tailwind. In memory, technology development investments, supporting AI, high-bandwidth memory and the improved in supply-demand environment support an expected return to growth for memory markets in 2025. The June quarter also marked another quarter of strong performance from our portfolio of broadband plasma or BBP products, which we also refer to as Gen 4 and Gen 5. This year marks 40 years of innovation for our BBP patterned wafer inspection business. We continue to see significant differentiation, keeping this product line at the forefront of defect discovery for the semiconductor industry. We expect this product family momentum to continue delivering strong relative growth performance in County Year 2024. AI continues to be a driver and an enabler for KLA's business. AI adoption is driving higher volume wafer manufacturing, more complex designs, larger die and chip size, and growing advanced packaging demands which support an increase in process control intensity. Last quarter, we estimated that the KLA opportunity to would reach approximately $400 million in annualized revenue exiting calendar 2024. Today, we're raising that estimate to more than $500 million in total advanced packaging revenue across the entire KLA portfolio on the momentum we're experiencing. Additionally, AI is enabling KLA to further differentiate our products and make continuous improvement in the performance of our systems. KLA Services business grew to $614 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Utilization rates of existing installed capacity are steadily rising across all business segments as end-market demand improves. Finally, quarterly free cash flow was $832 million. The last 12 months free cash flow was $3 billion, with free cash flow margin of 31% over the same period. KLA results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio specific product strategies. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product roadmaps, and preparing for growth at the leading edge. I'll now hand the call over to Bren to go through the financial highlights and outlook.
Bren Higgins : Thanks, Rick. KLA’s quarterly results demonstrated our market leadership combined with the consistent execution of our global team. KLA continued to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer's changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.57 billion above the guidance-based midpoint of $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.60 and GAAP diluted EPS was $6.18, both above their respective guidance midpoints. The gross margin was 62.5% at the upper end of the guidance range as a richer product mix than modeled and higher revenue volume drove upside to guidance. Operating expenses were $553 million. Operating expenses were comprised of $324 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Operating margin was 41%. Other income and expense net was a $32 million expense and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.6%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $893 million, GAAP net income was $836 million, cash flow from operations was $893 million, and free cash flow was $832 million. The company had $135.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets, major products, and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.7 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three major rating agencies. Moving to our outlook, we believe our business is transitioning from a period of stabilization to a resumption of growth, which began in our June quarter and we expect to continue through the remainder of Calendar 2024 and into 2025. For calendar 2024, we remain encouraged by the improvement in our customers revenue and profitability over the course of this year. This improvement will ultimately translate into new investment in capital equipment to support semiconductor growth over the medium-term. Our high-level outlook for the industry remains largely unchanged. Our expectation is for the WFE market to be in the mid $90 billion range and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. While it's too early to be overly specific on expectations for calendar 2025, we do expect a year of growth, fueled principally by growth and leading-edge investments in both Logic/Foundry and in memory. Given KLA's business momentum, we are confident in our relative performance opportunities moving forward. KLA's September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.75 billion plus or minus $150 million. Foundry/Logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecast to be approximately 80%. And memory is expected to be approximately 20% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 83% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 17%. Gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as higher revenue volumes offset by weaker anticipated product mix. Consistent with our comments last quarter, based on the current industry outlook, top-line growth expectations for calendar 2024, higher forecasted growth in services and expected system product mix, we are still modeling non-GAAP gross margins to remain relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically guarded by product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses are forecasted in September quarter to be approximately $565 million as we continue to make important R&D and scaling investments to support expected revenue growth. Looking ahead, we expect approximately $10 million to $15 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. This is supported by our revenue growth expectations and in-line with our 40% to 50% incremental operating margin business model. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include; other income and expense net of approximately $34 million expense, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $6.69 plus or minus $0.60, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $7 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135 million shares. In conclusion, our business has transitioned from a period of stabilization to one of growth. We remain optimistic that the indicators of improvement we have seen will continue throughout the remainder of calendar 2024 and into 2025. KLA is focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology roadmap requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives which are geared to drive outperformance. KLA's focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions, and operational excellence is what drives industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and allows us to return capital consistently. The return of scaling and increasing complexity has solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control in enabling technology advancements. This is not just an improving time to results in process integration and fab ramp, but also an optimizing yield across a volume production environment with high semiconductor device design mix. This bodes-well for KLA's long-term growth outlook. The near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving, and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain compelling. That concludes the prepared remarks. Let's begin Q&A. Kevin?
Kevin Kessel : Thank you, Bren. Operator, we're ready for you to provide instructions and begin the Q&A section.
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, recently TSMC said they expect the number of new tape outs for 2 nanometers in the first two years to be higher than what they saw for 3 and 5 in their first two years. And I think they've also heard a number of AI customers accelerate their roadmaps. I'm curious, what does this mean for KLA in terms of your outlook and kind of your share of the WFE wallet. And do you expect 2 nanometer to be a bigger factor for 2025 or for 2026?
Richard Wallace: Thanks for that. Yes, we're definitely having those same conversations with our customers in terms of in the reticle world, of course, when there are more design starts we see activity in the reticle market in terms of inspection for those reticles and then early lots. We're still early in N2 and in terms of your question, it's really going into 2025 and then 2026. But the other thing we've seen is strengthening in N3 as well. So I think both of those factors are being driven by some of the same drivers we talked about in the prepared remarks in terms of what we're seeing from AI driving that. So it does lead us to believe that our goals to increase our percent of WFE continue to be supported by the opportunities afforded by the additional process control challenges. So I think we're in pretty good shape with that. The other thing, of course, is being driven in some of these advanced AI chips as larger die size, which as you know are a bigger challenge from a yield perspective and creates more incentive for more inspection, especially as these processes are brought online and ramped up. So mostly what we see is it's 2025 leading into 2026 in terms of when they reach HBM. Bren, anything to add?
Bren Higgins: No, I think you covered most of it Rick, I would say also 1 of the things that were encouraged by that with the design start environment given the high mix of parts, that our participation with our customers in terms of process control and monitoring that happens in production tends to be at a higher level. So they're trying to manage a robust design environment that's testing design rules in different ways, and that tends to be positive for continuous process control investment as they wrap the node.
Richard Wallace: Remember, Vivek, earlier in the year, we talked about a more positive tone we were seeing from our customers and it was related to the early demand that they were starting to sense from their customers. That's why we believed and that's how it's playing out that we would see strengthening our business. Maybe what's new, a little bit new is the strength, additional strength in N3 which wasn't as forecasted as the rollout of N2. So I think both of those are adding to our belief that we're in a good period for consistent acceleration and demand on the leading edge.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Now on advanced packaging, you raised it from $400 million to $500 million. I wanted to clarify, is that on an exiting full year basis, or is that for the full year? So just that clarification, then, how would you break it out in terms of specialty and inspection metrology?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, It's a good question. So that's our expectation for the business level in 2024. So it isn't a run rate necessarily, but what we expect to do, which is significantly above what we did last year, which was closer to $300 million. So a mid-60% growth rate with continuing momentum. I would think that we would continue, at least through the first half of next year, to see strong demand around packaging. So, it's really an opportunity for us. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of customer interest as we're seeing more and more focus on broadband capability moving into the backend. So it's an encouraging opportunity moving forward. I think the growth rate relative to the growth rate at WFE will be higher over the next few years. So one of the things Vivek, I'm sure you've heard is that, one of the bottlenecks now for AI is silicon is part of it, but the packaging come off is also part of what we're seeing. And we had customers for the first time in my career from the front end start pulling us into packaging conversations because they want front-end capability, as Bren said being used in packaging to assist. So I think, we talked about AI being a driver, it's really driving not just the silicon but also packaging and also of course, HBM for -- you need all three of those to fully execute on the plans people have. So to your question on mix, about, I'd say 60% of it is process control. And then you have the remaining 40% is in our process -- specialty process business and also some exposure in terms of chemical process control as well. About 60% of it in the classic semiconductor process control part of our business.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about returning to growth for memory in 2025. I know it is early, but would love to hear kind of your initial thoughts and maybe separating DRAM versus NAND? And then within DRAM, how you are seeing HBM conversion versus DDR5 and greenfields? And same for NAND, later accounts versus any sort of expectations for greenfield in the 2025 time frame?
Bren Higgins: Well, 2024 is really a transition year for memory. We're not seeing a lot of growth overall. Some in the DRAM front and some investment that's happened in China. So I think from a WFE point of view, 2025 is when we expect to see more growth there. I think that you talked about the drivers, particularly around DRAM and HBM being drivers into next year. I think, as we see our customers' business models improve, and we are certainly seeing the financial performance improved with pricing going up, so significantly over the course of this year. But that will translate into investment as we move into next year. I think on the flash market, we're less bullish into next year, although it is operating off a pretty low level. We'll see as we get closer to it. But right now, we do see a recovery in both parts of it, but certainly led by more DRAM than flash on an absolute WFE basis.
Richard Wallace: Yes. And I think much like some of what we saw in the early discussions of AI last year where we didn't really see an increase in silicon because there was still utilization leverage that our customers have. Some of that's in memory. So we really don't see capacity starting to be added significantly until '25 and into '26 on HBM. So as Bren said conversion, but then you don't get the capacity until later, and it's really HBM associated DRAM before you see flash.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, again in the prepared remarks, you talked about confidence in your relative performance. And obviously, no question around the foundry/logic side, given the complexity and larger die size. But curious, as you see increased memory into the mix, is there enough share of wallet on the logic/foundry side to kind of mitigate that and allow that relative outperformance? Would love to hear the kind of puts and takes around that.
Bren Higgins: Yes, we feel pretty good, CJ. We are seeing relative performance this year, and this is a year that's still pretty heavy overall in what I'll call legacy levels of investment, particularly in China. So as we start to move to leading edge and you see the entry ramp and also the initial investments; and then two we would expect that given our position, particularly in certain markets that we expect to scale and grow much faster than the overall that we are pretty well positioned into next year to see foundry and logic leading edge investment drive KLA share of the overall spend. We were talking about DRAM and HBM. HBM is a device that tends to -- first of all, you have advanced DRAM, you have EUV as a -- you get the introduction of for use of EUV with those chips, but also as you start to put the chips together, it creates not only potential packaging opportunities moving forward, but you also have increased sampling to ensure that each of the DRAM die is functioning properly. So we've seen DRAM improve from a process control intensity point of view since the introduction of EUV. And so I would expect to see that continue as well as we move forward. So yes, I think we feel pretty good about the relative positioning of the company as we move into next year.
Richard Wallace: So CJ one of the things that we're seeing, and we haven't seen in many, many years, if you remember part of the reason memory had lower adoption was because of repair. And it seems that on leading DRAM, repair is less effective than it's been. And so that is a factor that's driving some of our customers. Obviously, they are going to try to get through that. But that's -- they're expecting that they are going to have larger [need] (ph) for -- a greater need for process control because of that. And as Bren said, you also have -- because of EUV, you get the introduction of print-check into memory, and they have issues associated with pellicle. So I know it's very much into the weeds, but it drives more print-check. So the process control adoption is setting up to maybe be better than historical, while most at least for the advanced DRAM.
CJ Muse: Very, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Harlan Sur: And good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As the team steps into the second half of this year, advanced technology node deployment is accelerating, obviously reflected in your strong guidance for the September quarter, appears to be reflected in your confidence on the spending outlook this calendar year and grows into next. Near-term, does the team anticipate sequential growth in the December quarter? And then relative to let's say, last earnings call has your qualitative view on 2025 improved? I mean I know, Rick, you mentioned incrementally better 3-nanometer investments. Any other indicators that are coming in better versus your prior expectations -- as you look into next year?
Richard Wallace: Harlan, I'll start here. First, we do expect sequential growth in the December quarter, as we discussed last quarter when we talked about the March quarter being the bottom and expectation of sequential growth through the year. So that's how we see things into the December quarter. We'll see how things play out in terms of what that looks like. I would say on the margin, we are incrementally more bullish certainly when you look at the funnel in terms of opportunities into next year. As we've seen that fill out, we have seen strength in the funnel to support our outlook into next year.
Harlan Sur: Perfect. And then for my follow-up, and this is sort of a follow-on to what Rick was saying, but as you mentioned, memory has always had a lower process control intensity. But there are dynamics that are pushing advanced logic-like capabilities right, into memory. You mentioned more EUV [adoption] (ph) in DRAM, but like for example, in HBM, DRAM, I mean, that's requiring is very advanced logic chip that sits at the bottom of the staff, right? That's using against CMOS logic technology in NAND, the periphery and controller chip, which is increasingly becoming more advanced logic is being processed separately from the NAND staff right, and then bond it together. And then this whole NAND sort of bonding technology process appears to be a nightmare from a manufacturability and yield perspective. But kicking in totality, I mean it does appear that these dynamics are driving memory process control intensity higher. I mean, any way to quantify, I know historically, memory intensity has been about 10%. But if you look at all of these trends over the next few years, like where can you see that memory intensity sort of trending to?
Bren Higgins: Yes. It's a good question, Harlan. And you did cover all the advancements that have us pretty excited in terms of opportunity moving forward. We have seen intensity improve over the last couple of years or so. But what we are waiting for to lean in, if you will, into those -- to that improvement is to see a full cycle in terms of investment by our customers. And so I think as we look into next year, I think that where we are today is probably we're historically around 10% that were probably in excess of 11% today. And I think moving forward, if we can execute and deliver some of the products and capabilities we have in development here, I think it creates a number of opportunities covering the things that you talked about and some of the other things we talked about in the last question or two.
Richard Wallace: Yes. And just contrast that from a few years ago Harlan, if you go back and you think about 3D, 3D happens and our customers go backwards in lithography, right? DRAM is not really pushing design rules nor pushing advanced logic around the DRAM and repair is still working. Like you take all those factors off and you get more into the expected growth and intensity that you get in logic or in the leading-edge foundry for similar reasons. But so we haven't fully modeled it because it's really hard -- customers are still trying to figure it out. But there is more characterization happening at the leading edge, leading us to believe that there is going to be more implementation. But until they've been through the cycles, they don't know, but it is to Bren's point, why we feel more bullish in our engagement in those customers, they recognize an increased need for the process control capability. And then you just add on this bonding packaging question, and that's a huge issue and the value of HBM is so high also. So I think there is a lot of factors. In many ways, there are plenty of opportunities. Then the other part of that, the answer is, making sure that our solutions actually are going to work for those opportunities, and we are still proving that out.
Harlan Sur : Perfect. Thank you very much.
Richard Wallace: Thanks Harlan.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur -- I apologize from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one for Rick on gate-all around-PDC intensity. Some of your peers have talked about 30% increase in metrology intensity at 2-nanometer gate-all-around or 3-nanometer. And the reticle inspection peers have talked about EUV map that's actually coming down to 20 from 30 from 3-nanometer. So when we put these two trends together, I'm curious how you're looking at your overall PDC intensity? And does that imply that you're gaining share on the reticle side?
Richard Wallace: So let me unpack that a little bit. I think that -- it is definitely the case for gate-all-around that it creates new integration challenges and so we've seen, and we've talked about this for some time now, the adoption of Gen 4 to support that in a new configuration to be able to resolve the issues around that. So there is -- that's a driver. It is also a different approach than what customers have to use for the -- because of the architectural [change] (ph). There's more metrology intensity being used and largely an increase in the need to control voltage threshold. So VT control becomes more important. And so that's also a part of it. You also just have film thickness measurement and management hire. So overall, we would anticipate but that's all kind of rolled into how we model the increasing process control intensity that we've outlined before there is really nothing that's different than when we model that going forward toward our 2026 plan in terms of overall process control intensity and our share performance there.
Bren Higgins: Atif, if you look back to the last local high and KLA share WFE, it was when the industry transitioned from planar to FinFet structures. So typically, architecture changes do drive because of just the change that's happening and the immaturity of the change, it does drive process control intensity to a higher level. So historically, it is proven. So Rick talked about not only inspection opportunities, but you are depositing a lot more layers, 20% to 30% more critical layers on the metrology side. So we think in a number of areas, it is going to create opportunities. And you still have the scaling dynamics, while Litho layers are constant. Those are still pretty challenging layers in terms of -- from a defect control point of view. So we are pretty bullish about the opportunities. I think it's feeding into a lot of what we've said here over -- in the last few questions in terms of our confidence moving into next year.
Atif Malik: Great. As a follow-up, Bren, the revenue guide is a bit wider than usual plus minus $150 million versus $125 million. Is that just a function of higher revenues? Or is there something else?
Bren Higgins: Yes, a function of higher revenues. It's about 5% or so. At some point, as we move through the different quarters and revenue ranges, we start to make an adjustment just because of the higher levels. So there is nothing indicative in that other than the revenue is up 9% higher and we decided to -- it was 9% in June and then the guidance, another 7%. So that it was prudent to raise the range. You have to also remember that we do have integers that are quite large. If you think about our broadband plasma systems, they could be anywhere even plus $20 million depending on the configuration. So tools moving in and out can have an impact in terms of our overall. So it's really more just the increasing revenue level and not related to anything else.
Atif Malik: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Christophe Caso: Yeah, thank you. Good evening. I guess first question is on the trends that you are seeing in mature node. And specifically -- well, I guess, China revenue in general I think your prior comments were an expectation for China about flat in the second half. You talked about if that's still your view and what you are seeing outside of the leading edge?
Richard Wallace: Yes. It still might not be the absolute dollar basis right? And then with the second half growing relative to the first half -- the percent will start to move in the second half versus the first half. But on an absolute dollar basis as I said last quarter, it's about flat. Now depending on what happens, you've got a lot of new projects and RevRec could be an issue with newer customers. So where it shows up in terms of which quarter, I'm not going to comment on. But if you just take a step back and look at a half-to-half point of view, it's very similar to what I said last quarter.
Christophe Caso: Got it. And then following on, you made some comments about the impact of high NA in the past. I mean, one could you remind us a little bit about the impact of high NA on process control? And then secondly, with regard to timing for that, there's been some noise around that about sort of implementation schedules? Anything different than you see on your side? And I recognize that you folks would probably be a little bit earlier in seeing that given the timing of when you install process control?
Richard Wallace: Well, I think that the difference for high NA -- the most obvious difference is you are going to continue scaling. So you are going to get smaller defects and you're going to have new challenges associated with reticle qualification and that takes the form both in the [mass shop] (ph), and ReQual and in Print Check. So all those factors continue, but it is really an extension of the trends that we've seen. And when you get high NA, you'll get also just the mix will shift. You'll have some layers initially of high NA and then you'll have others that are going to be the 0.33. I think what we're hearing and seeing from customers is very consistent with what we believed in terms of when HVM happens. We don't see any acceleration in the timing. If anything, there's the potential for delay in terms of the HVM implementation, there will be characterization work happening before that. But like all technology transitions, we see the existing technology often extends longer and has more upgrades and it's more cost effective. And that's what drives customers ultimately, it's about the economics. And so I think what will happen is if they can do that, then they'll bias toward extending the life of the 0.33 and the efficacy of that in the leading edge and then high NA comes after. So nothing has really changed in our view. No acceleration, if anything, potential for some additional delay in the implementation.
Christophe Caso: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one is actually on China and Rick and Bren thanks to the insight on the China revenues. I just kind of wanted to ask a question in a different way. One of your peers ASM International today said that China mature nodes are in a digesting mode and calendar Q1 was the peak. I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that? And how to think about China sales into next year, especially given a long lead time you might have a better insight than others? And also, is that a factor in your gross margin down just a smidge in September quarter? And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Krish. On China, it looks -- like I said earlier, I think from a half-to-half point of view, it's relatively flat. So I don't see any real change. A lot of that's dependent on project timing given the level of greenfield activity that we're seeing there. As we move into next year, my early view on our business levels is more or less consistent with what we're seeing this year. I think when you look at the order funnel, what we have in backlog, what we have in deposits, gives me some confidence in terms of what we see into next year. So I don't see a change. Obviously, the mix could -- will be changing. There's infrastructure investments. It's obviously the logic/foundry memory and so on. But from an overall level, it seems that it is pretty consistent year-to-year. On gross margin, it -- while we outperformed in the June quarter, it was a little bit more than what we had initially modeled in the quarter. There is some investment that we're seeing in the September quarter from that. When you look at KLA gross margins, I talk a lot about product mix being the biggest driver of our gross margin in terms of variability quarter-to-quarter. It's not customer mix, it's not region mix. It is the portfolio mix and not all the products in our portfolio carry the same margin profile, but also within the product families themselves. And particularly when you're selling across multiple nodes with highly configurable systems, you can end up with bearing gross margin profile even within the same product families. So it's really a function of that than it is anything else. And of course, the June quarter was stronger. I did put the comments, which were very consistent with last quarter in terms of expectations for this year in the mid 61% range. That's our expectation. And then moving forward, as we see the business continue to grow into [2025] (ph), I think you'll see KLA's general incremental gross margin performance in and around that 65% incremental gross margin, plus or minus, as we move forward here. But in any given quarter, it could add a little bit of variability, but nothing that's different than what we usually see.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging. Thanks for the color, like the $500 million run rate from $400 million like three months ago. Is this really a function of the advanced packaging market growing? Or -- are you like targeting markets like macro inspection, which I feel like your peers or your competitors are doing better than that? Are you like targeting those markets that's also helping some of this incremental revenue growth [indiscernible] this year? And also kind of curious if you can extrapolate that into like panel-level packaging, which is probably a few years out? Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Yes. I think there is no question that the package market is growing, and it's for all the reasons that you hear, I think that there's been an acceleration. And again, I mentioned earlier in the call that some of the gaps, if you think about what's going on overall with AI or packaging shortage related. So there is a lot of investment happening there. Is it not -- it's not just macro, it's what historically would have been considered pretty advanced lithography not that -- or inspection not that many years ago because the design rules and the yield and the what's at risk, cost-wise is much higher. Many years ago, when we bought a company and started doing packaging, one of our customers ask, why are you even bothering, this is not a KLA market. What happened in the last year is now customers are saying, we need your capability that you have in the front end to be applied into some of our advanced packaging challenges and accelerated workshops with us talking about that accelerated product road maps and a lot of customer excitement and interest. So they're driving it very hard because they have shortages, and it is really across many of our products, both in our processing, but also in our process control. So it's been significant to see the growth and the speed of it. As we said, that's the annualized -- that's the annual number for calendar '24, but we'd expect the trend to continue towards growth in '25 and beyond.
Bren Higgins: Most of our growth has been more on the logic side. And I think one of the things we are excited about moving forward is that as you move in high-bandwidth memory to hybrid bonding techniques, they do increase the complexity of the process of fair amount. And as you know, the KLA position in the market is one of higher value offerings, supporting more complexity. And so we're encouraged by what those opportunities might look like as we get out into the into the '26 and '27 time frame. Obviously, the industry is thinking a lot about what's next in terms of panel level packaging and so on. And so there is obviously R&D that goes into that. But -- so that's work that we will be doing in the company. And so I think that those opportunities, to Rick's point, are just showcasing, I think what's the opportunities that are available in this part of the market over the next several years.
Richard Wallace: Just one final point. Some of our customers -- our competitors are coming at this from a lower end. And in many cases, the requirements are at the top end of their capability. And so what we're hearing from customers is, even though in some cases, they are buying our systems, what are at the bottom-end of our capability, what they also want is the road map. So I think they want the ability to buy that capability now the expectation and the knowledge that they can upgrade it over time as their requirements continue because you are now with that packaging. There is no question that road map is going to look more like a traditional scaling road map going forward.
Krish Sankar: Gotcha. It’s future proofing. Thanks Rick, thanks Bren. Very helpful. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Thanks Krish.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Joseph Quattrocci: Yeah, thank you taking the question. I just want to kind of understand, I think looking at the guide for the September quarter and thinking about sequential growth into the December quarter, is it more fair to assume now they're kind of thinking about low double-digit half-on-half growth rate for the calendar year relative to the high single digit last quarter that you talked about. And then kind of duck-tailing that, I think last quarter, you talked about process control systems mixes being closer to like 70% for foundry/logic. Is that maybe a bit higher than that now?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So on those fronts so again, I don't want to guide December, but I think high single digit, low double digit is probably the right way to think about our performance for the year overall. So I think that as we saw in June relative to the expectations we had a few months ago, we did better than we thought September guide was higher, certainly higher than what consensus was. So I think the incremental optimism I talked about earlier in the funnel is revealing and some incremental growth here through the second half of the year. When I look at the overall mix of business, I think that foundry/logic is likely closer to 75%. So last year 70%-30% or approximate semiconductor process control shipments -- or revenue to semiconductor customers is closer to [75%, 25% and 24%] (ph). But we'll see how it ends up.
Joseph Quattrocci: Perfect. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, the [N3] (ph) strength you're talking about, I mean, given the lead times for Gen 4, Gen 5, I mean is that going to kind of enter the model in terms of demand into next year? Is that how we should think about that? Or can some of those tools be pulled into 2024?
Bren Higgins: Well, we are seeing more capacity come online. Those are products where we've been supply constrained certainly around Gen 4. So as new capacity comes online. I think it's one of the challenges for us frankly, back in 2023 as we were limited and as we move through this year, from a quarterly run rate point of view, we are getting incremental supply and that -- given the supply constraints and the level of demand, we are seeing growth there and would expect to see that continue into next year. So I'm fairly bullish on that part of the business growing faster than the overall market, both this year and next year. So I think that's one of those areas that I said earlier about our relative confidence in terms of share of the overall market is our presence in certain markets that are growing extremely fast relative to the overall and certainly high-end wafer inspection is one of those.
Joseph Quattrocci : Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to double quick on China and what you're seeing in the region. You guys gave a lot of color in terms of what you're expecting for the overall geo. But by application, any standouts as you think about DRAM, foundry, other applications or maybe by customer type, mask making, wafer making, et cetera, whether it be trends you saw in the first half? Or as you think about the flattish outlook in the second half, and you stand out to the positive side or the negative side?
Bren Higgins: DRAM was stronger in the first half and will be in the second half. I would expect that wafers probably a little weaker. I think on the reticle side, it is a little bit stronger. And then foundry/logic is stronger offsetting the weaker memory.
Richard Wallace: Some weakness in automotive.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up on your services business, you guys grew 14% year-over-year. and you are outperforming your peers, and I think that's off of a higher base relative to your peers, too, so really good to see that. You talked about growing toward the high end for the remainder of the year, if I'm not mistaken. Is that just simply utilization rates across your customer base improving? Or is there more to it? And as a quick follow-up, is 12% to 14% still the right range?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So utilization rates are certainly a factor. So we've seen those steadily improve across all segments in the course of this year. And so that's been a driver of incremental revenue. The other thing, and we had pretty good visibility to this was the shipments that we -- or the tools that we shipped in '21 and '22, have come off of warranty and gone into contract. In our contract renewal or attach rate is about 95%. So as those tools go up a warranty into contract that that's a driver. So we've had pretty good visibility into the service business. We've had a headwind from FX because you do have some of the service revenue denominated in local currency particularly in Japan. So there's been some headwinds to the growth rate, frankly. But yes, we are trending towards that 14% sort of top part of the guidance range. And I think for the target we put out there. And I think as we go over the next couple of years, I feel like we are closer to the top end of the range than the bottom end of the range. Thank you Toshiya.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I also had a couple of China follow-ups. At one point, you had a pretty sizable multi-national business in China is the business today mostly dominated by the China sovereigns, I assume?
Bren Higgins: Yes. We are a very little multinational business in China.
Joe Moore: Okay. And then on the China sovereign side, I mean, having seen that business shift to more of a trailing edge focus, what's happened to process control intensity? And you seem to be keeping pace with all of your competitors in terms of China exposure. So you seem to be doing quite well. I might have thought that the process control intensity would drop off given the focus on lagging edge technology.
Richard Wallace: Sure. It is definitely not as high as what you would see on leading edge. But often in the case of you have small relatively size-wise small sites, then you are not really up against the percent against a huge number of wafer starts. So that's one factor. The other factor is some of the infrastructure that people are adding in terms of whether it is mask shops or wafer. So in aggregate, that's why it's for us, it's pretty much helps serve.
Bren Higgins: And Joe, on the multinational question, I mean, most of that business is service, right? We're not really -- there's no real equipment business that's happening with our multinational customers there, but there is sort of this activity supporting those fabs.
Joe Moore: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: And then we'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Srinivas Pajjuri: Hi guys. Couple of long -- actually, one question about 2025 WFE. Rick obviously, demand is improving across the board, in China is stable. So that makes sense that WFE will grow next year. I'm just wondering in terms of -- in your assumptions, what sort of assumptions are you making as far as the chips money is concerned? Because the check seems to be coming in, in second half. Just wondering if we're getting an explicit signals from your customers that, that money is being spent in 2025?
Richard Wallace: Yes. Our forecasts are entirely independent of any [ChipPAC] (ph) money. There's no dependence on that. That if our customers receive that, it's going to be -- they're going to be getting it what they tell us is to offset cost of building fabs in places that are more expensive. But it's not contributing to that they are going to build capacity based on demand. The demand is just going to be based on their market, the overall market and then they'll buy equipment accordingly. But we are not counting on our customers get ChipPAC money to make our plans.
Srinivas Pajjuri: Okay. Thank you. And then more of a technology question, Rick. I time to time, get questions about APMI for mask inspection. My understanding is that you guys were involved in that market and maybe exited at some point? I'm just curious, maybe I'm wrong here, but I just want to get your thoughts on that as to how you are approaching that market and what your strategy for that market is?
Richard Wallace: Yes. We have not -- we're heavily involved in the reticle market. It's a market that really we started comparing with, and we're still involved in it heavily. The question on, do you need actinic inspection for reticles. It's been a long debate that we've had in our conclusion based on all the analysis that we've seen is the real market need for that is when high NA gets introduced because of the existing technology nodes, there's really three ways to deal with the problems. One is the challenges of reticle quality. One is the flagship product line that we've had for a long time, the 6xx accident extensions to that. The other one is an e-beam product that we've talked about that's being used for very high resolution. And right now, it is the highest sensitivity reticle inspection tool still in where -- with our customers, we are still in the characterization of that tool, that's the 8xx. And then the last one is printing onto wafers and verifying the goodness of the reticles and that's what we're using basically using the Gen 5 print check application for. When it comes to investment in the actinic or the product that we've identified for high NA, we're pretty confident of our ability to intercept the high volume manufacturing of high NA, which is still some years away.
Srinivas Pajjuri: Thank you. Very helpful.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Brian Chin: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Rick, you talked about inflections and sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. Are you also seeing this in terms of bookings? And did your 12-month [shippable RPO] (ph) increase this quarter?
Richard Wallace: So we'll have all the specifics on that in the 10-K that we'll file here another week or two. It was pretty close to flat, down about $70 million quarter-on-quarter, so pretty flattish compared to last quarter. I think given what we're seeing in the funnel, I would expect it likely to probably over the next few quarters, we'll start to see it increase. But yes, just slightly down from last quarter.
Brian Chin: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess you've made a lot of disclosures in the past couple of calls about advanced packaging, and you saw even a step-up on the year forecast over the past three months. Can you sort of ballpark how large the advanced packaging process control TAM is? It's – you are probably not at your kind of typical on average 50%, 60% market share in process control overall. But maybe a sense of where the starting point is now. And obviously, I'm sure you expect the market to grow and probably your share as well in the years ahead.
Richard Wallace: I'll let Bren deal with the specifics. This is Rick. But it's not just process control for us. It is also process tools because of the SPTS acquisition we did about five years ago.
Bren Higgins: Yes. Look, we -- right now, our view is that this part of the market will grow faster than overall WFE. So if you look in the long run, as we expect WFE over the next few years, the capital intensity slowly rising to grow a little bit faster than semiconductor revenue that this part of the market will likely grow faster than that. So that's the only quantifying we've done at this point. To Rick's point, we have a broad portfolio, we are seeing parts of it on the inspection side move up market, but we also sell a number of process tools. We also sell some chemical process control capability as well. So we are approaching this market in multiple ways. And like I said I think that, as we talked about earlier, in the memory part of the market as it relates to HBM, we think we are better positioned relative to some of the technology transitions that are coming in terms of our share opportunity moving forward.
Brian Chin: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask you on the outlook for EPC. I think you were looking for growth last time. Might came in a little bit below. Just curious since we're going through all the calendar '24 forecast, if you could update that one.
Bren Higgins: Yes. On specialty semiconductor quarter-to-quarter, it dipped a little bit in the June quarter, but that's for the timing issue. I think our expectation in that business is still some modest growth for the year. That has -- that business has a pretty diversified market exposure. And as power semi related to automotive has come down. We've seen packaging pick up, but there's a little bit of a dip in June, but recovers and has a much stronger second half. Flat panel business is where we announced our exit of that, and so we still have revenue in our plans for that as we exit that business and would expect in the manufacturing likely in Q1 of 2025. On the PCB front, which is more consumer centric, we still have -- that market has been relatively sluggish, it is improved a bit, but not much. And that's obviously tied much more to mobility. And so improvements into the future as we see more cell phone unit growth will drive that business. Now there was -- that business had a very strong '21 and into '22, a lot of capacity added during that coded period. And so the industry is still working off some of that capacity. Now in that business, we do have service exposure. So you have pretty good contract penetration in the PCB world. So while the systems business has been slower, there have been service contributions from a revenue point of view that we've had over the last year or so. But I would think that overall the aggregate part of that business is up a few points year-to-year. I think it is -- we'll call low to mid-single digits.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask -- I know there's been a couple of questions on China. I hear from others that you're hearing less new names, and I think the thought was maybe it would be more build-out of facilities that were already in process. You talked about greenfield there. And obviously, there's another slug of money potentially coming in. So as you look out a year more. I'm just kind of curious how you think about that frenzy we had before of all these new names that you never heard of before, creating companies. Are you seeing any view that, that might come back?
Bren Higgins: Well, there's still some new business from new customers. The other thing that's happening in China is you do see investment from our mature legacy customers in China. And so where we've been engaged in supporting those customers for many, many years. And their businesses are typically driven by supply for specific markets and in response to expectations of demand moving forward. So you do have those customers also investing more here, I think moving forward. And then you do move into second phases with certain ones, but there is also some new ones too. So it's a pretty broad mix as I look at the remainder of this year and into next year.
Blayne Curtis: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: And we'll take our last question today from Tim Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks. I had two. So Bren, my question on China. So there's been some recent news. Obviously, the US diplomatic commerce is trying to use the [foreign reticle] (ph) against some of the non-U.S. suppliers and it would kind of suggest that maybe there's some forthcoming news that there is a reason why they would want to use the FDPR, like maybe some entity-list addition. So how do you think about that? I know it's kind of hard for you to even handicap your guidance for that? And I assume you're not accounting for that at all because you don't even know like whether that's going to come. But how do you kind of think about that and what the likelihood is and how do you even handicap for it?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim, I mean, there's been a lot of news for some time. And so you're right, I can't participate here in speculation and hypotheticals about what could or could not happen. So we will continue to assess, we’re very closely with the US government. Of course, we do everything we need to do in the company to be in compliance. We will follow the laws we do, and we'll support our customers as well within the confines of whatever the regulations are. So if and when something happens, we'll assess the impact and let you know what the impact is in sort of the near term and what might be over the long term.
Richard Wallace: Well, one of the things we talked about a lot, Tim, and I know you know this, is the because of where we are with the AI drivers, we're seeing an acceleration at the leading edge. So if we think about what's really going to propel our business going forward, it's not so much the legacy, which has been may be overrepresented on historical levels the last few years. But it's the stuff we are seeing right now, especially at the leading edge in terms of leading-edge foundry, and that's been driving a lot of our business in our expectations around what we are seeing in N3 and N2, plus the packaging plus we're seeing in HBM. So if I think about ‘25, ‘26, those are going to be the things that drive KLA drive our performance and should drive good opportunities for our investors.
Bren Higgins: If you go back to 2022, 75% plus of our business was what we'll call leading edge advanced design rules, 20-nanometer or below. So with the expectation of a ramp into next year from our leading-edge customers on the logic and memory side, we think that, that's going to drive the hundreds of our business as we move over the course of next year and beyond.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then last thing. So book-to-bill based on the RPO, book-to-bill was just a touch below 1%. So this is the seventh quarter that it's been below one. And it sounds like you think book-to-bill is going to start to drift up actually that we are going to finally start to be above one. So is there some dynamic where it seems like there was this massive slug of bookings that happened back in mid-'22 and we've been kind of shipping off of that ever since. And are we kind of getting to a point now where you think that customers are kind of coming back in and there and we could begin to see book-to-bill start to drift above one, where we can start to not just be shipping off of this big slug of orders in the middle of 2022?
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think based on the funnel that we will see -- I think the order profile looks pretty good. Now orders are not always indicative of what's going on given the number of customers and the size of the orders. And then when it comes to KLA, even the size of the ASPs of certain types of products. But all that being said, yes, it went from about $13 billion at its peak in terms of RPO down to just 10 today. So it's still quite large, but I would expect that moving forward that at least over the next couple of quarters, it looks that the order profile looks decent. So yes, I think that's a reasonable way to see it.
Richard Wallace: Thank you Tim.
Operator: I'll now turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks.
Kevin Kessel: All right. On behalf of KLA, we appreciate your time and your interest. We'll be seeing many of you through this quarter at different conferences. If you have any follow-up questions, please do reach out to the KLA Investor Relations team. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude the call.
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-04-25 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Doug, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you for joining our earnings call to discuss the March 2024 results and the June quarter outlook. I am joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace; and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results released after the market close and available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials. Today's discussion and metrics are presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. All full year references are to calendar years. Earnings materials contain a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events, presentations, corporate governance information and links to the SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the disclosures of risk factors in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some introductory comments followed by Bren with additional financial highlights, including our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Today, I will review KLA's March quarter results, main highlights and address the new market share reports as well as a broader industry outlook. KLA's revenue of $2.36 billion was above the midpoint of our guidance range. EPS results, both non-GAAP and GAAP, were above the midpoint of the adjusted guidance we provided on March 18 in conjunction with the decision to exit the flat panel business. Market conditions have stabilized, and we expect our business to improve as we progress through the year. We're encouraged by the improvement in our customers' business across multiple end markets, which is driving discussions with our customers about future opportunities for leading-edge capacity investments. At the start of each year, new global market share reports are published by third parties that provide additional insights into the state of our industry. These reports show consistent, long-term KLA market leadership in process control and demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio that offers our customers unique capabilities to address their technology challenges while meeting their productivity demands. This year, following significant gain in 2022, KLA's 2023 market share declined by nearly 1%, driven primarily by a loss in access to approximately 10% of the China market as a result of U.S. government export controls. That said, KLA's consistent market leadership in process control and some of the most critical markets in WFE reflect the success of our customer-focused strategies and the power of our portfolio. We're confident that KLA's quarterly revenues bottomed in the March quarter as expressed in our prior earnings call. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and slowly rising capital intensity continue to be a long-term tailwind. Additionally, the increasing complexity in advanced packaging applications for AI and other advanced technologies drive demand for both our process tool and process control products. Overall demand growth, along with increasing technology requirements will drive the need for more capability from inspection and metrology systems. Our advanced packaging business will generate approximately $400 million in run rate in 2024, and we expect this business to achieve growth rates meaningfully above the growth rate of WFE going forward. In services, our business grew to $590 million in the quarter, up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year. Quarterly free cash flow was $838 million, and the last 12 months free cash flow was $3.1 billion with a free cash flow margin of 32% over the period. KLA's quarterly results continue to demonstrate our sustained process control leadership and the success of our broad portfolio and product strategies. Customers continue to prioritize and invest in leading-edge technology transition and this aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings. In this industry environment, KLA will continue to focus on supporting customer requirements, executing on product road maps and preparing for growth at the leading edge. Bren will now discuss the financials and our outlook further.
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results demonstrated a consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show  resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing requirements. Quarterly revenue was $2.36 billion, above the guidance midpoint of $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.26, above the guidance midpoint of $4.83. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.43, above the guidance midpoint of $4.06. In the March quarter, both non-GAAP and GAAP diluted EPS were negatively impacted by a $62 million charge for excess and obsolete inventory related to the company's strategic decision to exit the flat panel display business announced on March 18. This charge had a $0.40 impact on EPS. Excluding this item, diluted non-GAAP EPS would have been $5.66. Non-GAAP gross margin was 59.8%, above the top end of the revised guidance range. Excluding the FPD charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been 62.4% and roughly flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $544 million comprised of $320 million in R&D and $224 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP EPS at the 13.5% guided tax rate would have been $0.04 higher or $5.30. Non-GAAP operating margin was 36.8%. Non-GAAP other income and expense, net, was a $34 million expense and the quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate was 14.2%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $715 million, GAAP net income was $602 million. Cash flow from operations was $910 million, and free cash flow was $838 million. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments, end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. On February 1, KLA issued $500 million of 4.7% senior notes due in 2034 and $250 million of 4.95% senior notes due in 2052. The  company expects to use the net proceeds from the notes offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding indebtedness at or prior to maturity. Moving to our outlook. We remain encouraged by constructive customer discussions around their future investment plans, which are further supported by recent reports of an improving end market demand environment and customer profitability. Consistent with these industry trends, as we indicated in last quarter, we believe our business bottomed from a revenue perspective in the March quarter and looking ahead through the balance of calendar '24, growth is resuming in the June quarter, and we expect business levels to improve as we progress through the year. For calendar 2024, our high-level outlook remains unchanged. We still expect WFE demand to be roughly flat to modestly up from 2023 and that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half. KLA's June quarter guidance is as follows: revenue of $2.5 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry/logic revenue from semiconductor customers is forecasted to be approximately 82% and memory is expected to be 18% of semi-process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 78% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 22%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in the range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point based on product mix expectations. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling non-GAAP gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted in the June quarter to be approximately $550 million as our merit adjustment process occurred in the March quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth in quarterly operating expenses for the remainder of calendar 2024, supported by expected revenue growth. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately $38 million expense. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $5.66, plus or minus $0.60. And a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $6.07, plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.4 million shares. In conclusion, as we articulated 12 weeks ago, we are encouraged with the indicators of improvement ranging from our customers' conversations to the public reports over the past few months. KLA remains focused on delivering a differentiated product portfolio that anticipates customers' technology road map requirements and drives our longer-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have solidified our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield across a high semiconductor device design mix, volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook as near-term industry demand trends are continuing to improve. In alignment with this, KLA's business is improving and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact in both legacy and leading-edge markets. That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Operator, can you please provide instructions for.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Last year and first half of this year was more mature node by spending maybe more infrastructure focused as well. As you step into the second half of this year, it does feel like advanced node momentum is starting to accelerate right, both foundry and logic and memory and -- appears to be reflected in your confidence on improving spending outlook for this calendar year. Given your relatively longer lead time, your critical role in enabling these advanced technology migrations, like how are customer discussions, the initial forecast visibility and outlook for calendar '25 shaping up for the team? I mean I assume it's a more advanced technology-driven profile next year, which should be good for the team, but wanted to get your views.
Richard Wallace: Great. Harlan, thanks for the question. This is Rick. Absolutely, we are having different kind of discussions now than we've had for a while with our leading-edge logic and memory customers. As they prepare for the ramp and we're seeing increased demand for -- they are seeing increased demand, they're talking about tool availability, scheduling of resources, making sure that they don't get behind, really conversations we haven't had for a while. I think the build-outs are still -- as we indicated, we see kind of stability with rising demand through the year, but the real build-out is going to come in '25 and beyond that as we see some of the conversations we're having. So really good indicators, leading indicators, design starts, advanced node discussions, R&D work. So we feel pretty good about the setup.
Harlan Sur: Great. And did you see the continued growth in the services business with industry utilizations clearly on an upward trajectory. You've got record number of tools coming off warranty customers, I think, wanting more value-added services and offerings just given the complexity challenges ahead? Has the view on the services growth profile improved relative to the last earnings call? I know you talked about being at the upper end of that sort of 12% to 14% sort of target range this year on the last call. Has that changed?
Bren Higgins: I would say -- Harlan, it's Bren. I would say, look, we're continuing to see very strong momentum, utilization rates are improving. We had a lot of tools come off of warranty, and they go into contract and our conversion rate is about 95%. So that's very positive. Customers are extending lives of the systems, which bodes well for long-term service growth overall. So I think as we track here, I think we feel pretty good about the range that we have, and we're closer to the upper end for sure than the lower end as we move forward over the next few years.
Operator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Christopher Muse: I guess, first question, a near-term question on the mix you expect for June, which a pretty massive shift to foundry/logic from memory. So, I guess, as part of that, can you speak to some of the underlying drivers? And within that, do you see perhaps a pickup from domestic China memory beyond the June quarter? Or I think in the prior quarter, you talked about revenue rec pushed to the June quarter. So curious about the moving parts there.
Richard Wallace: Yes. I would say as far as China memory goes, it's more first half heavy than second half, while we're having very positive conversations with our customers on the memory front, as Rick indicated, in terms of long-term plans, we're seeing their businesses now improve. We're seeing profitability and cash flow starting to improve. But we don't expect any significant investments as we move through the rest of the year. Nothings could change. But I think that the profile, it might tick up a little bit in the second half overall, non-China but I don't see it changing in a real meaningful way. If you look back at our business, we were a little bit over 70%, maybe logic/foundry in 2023. And I think we're going to be right around 70%. I think it's going to be pretty similar overall mix this year.
Christopher Muse: Excellent. And then in terms of your commentary around accelerating top line revenues throughout the remainder of calendar '24. I guess, can you speak to the main drivers there as it relates to perhaps 2-nanometer pilot logic in Arizona handset-related EPC. What's really driving that? And is there sort of a percentage growth rate we should be thinking about half-on-half?
Bren Higgins: Yes. C.J., I think you covered most of them, right? We will see some early investment in 2-nanometer. You have the 3-nanometer build-out. You have the investment that you mentioned in Arizona. So those are all pretty good for logic/foundry segment. Right now, when I look at the overall business first half versus second half, I think the second half is high single digits versus the first half in that ballpark. We're not guiding, but I think it's going to end up in that range as we progress through the year. On EPC front, I think it is a little bit stronger. You do have some seasonality in EPC in the first part of the year. But we'll see some improvement there, I think, as we move through the second half of the year as well. And of course, service is growing quarter-on-quarter. So you've got that effect as well.
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I have two of them. One is, Rick or Bren, last quarter, you kind of said that for KLA, the overall calendar '24 revenues could grow mid-single digits based on WFE. And obviously, some of these expectations that mid-single digits [indiscernible]. Given that you do have some exposure on that side, I'm just kind of curious how to think about your overall revenue profile for this year -- year-over-year? And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Yes. So -- and when you look at the WFE level and when we talk about a flat to modestly up. And that, I think, depends on your view of WFE as everybody adds it up differently. Our view is that WFE was probably $90 billion to $91 billion, and then it's slightly up from there -- or flat to slightly up from there in terms of how we're looking at this year. So I think that's the way to think about it. Simply put, given that WFE is more or less flat to modestly up, that we were going to see this increase in service that we talked about, we're going to see some modest improvement in EPC. And we've seen some improvement given the outperformance we saw in March, the incremental guide into June in our semi PC business. So I think overall, semi PC share in the overall market is probably going to be fairly consistent, maybe a little bit up from what we saw in '23. And all that translates into our semi PC business roughly performing mostly in line with where we think the market is going to be for this year.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on China. Given your long lead times, I'm kind of curious how do you think about China? You did say memory would be first [ uprated ] overall China revenues? And along the same path, if I back out the FPD gross margins from March to June is down 90 basis points Q-over-Q. You said it's product mix? Is it mainly from China? I'm just kind of curious on this.
Bren Higgins: Yes. No, it's mostly product mix quarter-on-quarter, down from the FPD adjustment related to the inventory that we took related to the decision there. So it's mostly just product mix across our semi PC business. You do have some growth in service quarter-on-quarter and services is dilutive to the overall gross margin. We believe it's accretive to the operating margin, but the gross margin is a little dilutive. And then the rest is just the normal product mix we have across the portfolio. Different margin profiles across the portfolio. And so depending on what we're revenue in a given quarter, it can cause some fluctuation. But I think the guidance range is appropriate, like we saw -- I think we guided somewhere around 61.5% last quarter. It came in above 62%, depending on how things end up revenuing as we engage with customers and ship systems, there's always room for upside, which is why we give the range that we give. So there's nothing really particular to actual customers. It's more about the product mix of all regions. It's more about the product mix of the products we're shipping and getting acceptance.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Is China [ shipment ] for the rest of the year, similar range or?
Bren Higgins: So China is interesting. I think it's probably flattish over the course of the year. Second half is more or less flattish with the first half. The mix is changing a bit in terms of the end market mix. But we see it as a percent of the total come down as we see most of the growth in the year coming from our non-China customers.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Stifel.
Brian Chin: Ask a few questions. I guess, it is sort of asked earlier, but with all these CHIPS Act announcements continuing to roll in, has this solidified the timing or magnitude of any of the U.S. greenfields build-out? Or maybe what is your latest thinking on some of these projects?
Richard Wallace: Well, yes, there have been many announcements. It's exciting to see. But when you look at the timing for those projects, even, for example, the one that was announced today in New York, that one's quite a ways out. So I think the approval of the funding relative to the timing, the customers we talk to, they're excited about this, the chance to reshore under the U.S., but they're still building their capacity based on market demand. So it doesn't really affect the overall capacity investment. They're gauging that based on the overall demand. And I think what happens is -- it's the size of the investment in terms of how many wafer starts to add and what point is driven by the market. So we'd stick to the comments about when the -- what we seek for the business environment relatively independent of what location that the customers are choosing to make those investments.
Brian Chin: Got it. That's fair. And then maybe I did notice that in the shareholder letter and on the call, you highlighted advanced packaging revenue could be around $400 million in calendar '24, what growth rate does that represent versus calendar '23? And then how would you size your served addressable market in advanced packaging, which I know certainly crosses, I guess, boundaries across your portfolio?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So it's greater than 25%. So we're somewhere down in around [ $300 million ] in '23 -- a little over [ $300 million ] and close to $400 million expectation for '24. It's across a broad portfolio, right? We have process control, which we sell to those customers, which is inspection of metrology, but also process tools in our specialty semiconductor business. It's about 50-50 in terms of the contribution from each part of the portfolio. And I think on the go forward, we feel pretty excited about the opportunity to see a growth rate that's meaningfully faster than WFE.
Richard Wallace: Yes. And I think for opportunity, there's a couple of factors that are at play. One is the speed with which customers are accelerating their packaging efforts. The degree with which those are requiring leading edge. Our ability to make it make sense from a business standpoint, the packaging challenges really need to be leading edge. So there's still a number of packaging applications that are in markets that are served by lower-end competitors that we're not really competing for. So it has to do with how quickly the new technologies come on, but this has been an increased conversation in meetings that we've been having with leading customers for the last year or so. It was already talked about, but it's accelerating. So I think it's hard to judge exactly what the growth rate will be at this point. But it's pretty clear that there's a huge demand. And for many customers, they view it as the competitive necessity in order to -- there's very much of a race of getting that new capability into the market, especially as it pertains to some of the AI applications. So I would say that it's a huge driver for our customers we're engaged. There's a lot of requests for new capability and some of it comes down to us developing solutions in conjunction with those customers to meet those demands. But on its own as it stands right now, it will outgrow WFE and we think it has the potential to go well beyond that, depending on how the adoption goes and how we continue to execute against it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Tim Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: I'm going to ask about N2, Rick. So -- there has been a lot of talk recently about the big volume in for N2 is not going to be probably until '26, although there will certainly be some customers -- crypto customers and whatnot that will ramp in '25. So there will be capacity that gets installed next year. So I guess my question is, how much of a driver do you think N2 will specifically be for your business? Are you seeing any of that yet? Is it more in the back half of this year thing? Is that -- so I'm just asking about like timing, when that starts to help your business?
Richard Wallace: Yes. Great question. It is definitely being one of the conversations we're having with critical customers about timing. And we have seen -- part of our optimism going forward is those conversations are being pulled in, in terms of the needs because our customers are feeling end market pull. So I think you're right that it's -- the bulk of it -- the highest volume will be in '26. But for KLA we're already seeing those conversations, and we'll start to see some meaningful business in '25 for that with orders coming toward the end of '24 as customers figure it out. The other thing is we're seeing a number of advanced design starts for the 2-nanometer node. It's a big -- as you know, Tim, it's a big power favorable node. And so for a lot of customers, some of the challenges around data center and frankly, around AI are power related in terms of customers being able to even build those sites. So it's a big driver for our customers right now. So we think N2 is going to be a very significant node, and we're going to definitely see a lot of that. We're already seeing the activity, but it will be a big factor in '25 and then as we go through '25.
Timothy Arcuri: Got it. Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then I want to ask about China. Bren, you just said -- I think you said China is going to be flattish sort of in the back half of the year. I mean it sounds like every quarter China keeps getting stronger [indiscernible] I think it's going to downtick and it doesn't because they're just going to take tools of loans -- they're allowed to take tools. So my question is really just on the mix around China. Is this -- is the back half filling in a bit because of new customers? I mean there will be 30 to 40 new has been built, if not more than that, that are part of these big customer relationships under the names. And so is it these newly named fabs that are coming on that are sort of filling in the back half of the year? And then if we've seen a lot of headlines around potential entity list additions, if this happens, which there's been a lot of headlines about it. But if it does happen, is this downside to what you're thinking for the back half of the year or for next year?
Bren Higgins: Well, Tim, I don't want to speculate about hypotheticals about what might come or not come from the U.S. government in regards to further export controls, and we're continuing to work very closely with the government and spend a lot of time and resources to make sure that whatever the rules are that we're were compliant. It's a pretty decent mix. I talked about DRAM being down. I think the wafer infrastructure in the second half -- I think the wafer infrastructure is probably down a little bit in the second half. I think the reticle infrastructure is probably up, and then the logic/foundry is up overall. And when you net it all out, it's basically a flattish profile. The customer mix, you have -- you do have a number of new projects continuing to take systems, but you also have the -- I'll call them, the more mature legacy customers in China that are also part of that mix. So I think it's continuing to be healthy, I think, through this year. And I think the profile as we -- even beyond this year feels like it kind of continues more or less at current levels. Obviously, those are like half to half [indiscernible]  and in any given quarter, we'll see some movement. But that's how we see things today.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham.
Yu Shi: I want to ask a question to build on what was discussed with the team earlier. So TSMC definitely said that the revenue is going to ramp in 2026 for N2. And you kind of alluded to that, that you think the '26 volume for you will be higher than '25. But if I look at how the 3-nanometer ramps look like, and it occurred to me that 2022, which was minus 1 year in terms of production time line for the 3-nanometer was a higher volume for you guys compared with probably 2023. So I just really wonder the fact that you said you think that '26 will be a high volume for you compared with '25? Was that coming from some discussion with the customers? And what's changed this time, why they want,  kind of I mean, move the capacity to a little bit closer to the high volume at the point of entry to the high-volume production?
Richard Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. And there's a couple of things to consider when thinking about N2. First of all, this is now very clear in our customers' minds a race for AI capability. And so you see several design starts happening, not just the ones we're most familiar with, but other players too design for capability. So you have a very different demand environment. You also have a constrained capacity environment now constrained somewhat even by the ability to build facilities. But the last factor is you have the KLA phenomenon as we get pulled in early. So we're front-end loaded into some of these facilities because you need our systems to be able to qualify the rest. So it is a different node than what we've seen in quite a while because of those factors. And there -- as we meet with customers, they are very concerned about supporting the demand that they're seeing. That's why we believe we're going to get a lot of pressure to support the end of this calendar year to start supporting some of the POs that we're going to see as they plan out those nodes, and it will go through -- and we're talking about volume in '26 for them, but toward the end of '25 is when we'll be seeing more and more of that business. And of course, we don't know how much broader it's going to get in terms of the number of design starts. It is remarkable that there are this many designs specifically for 1 application at this point in the process, but it's pretty remarkably consistent as we talk to different customers and even their customers.
Yu Shi: Maybe a second question, I want to ask you about the advanced packaging capability you're building there, it sounds like you're having more of the constructive conversation with your customers maybe to put more of KLA's more advanced process control capabilities into the packaging side of the process control. So I get the overall idea, but just really hopeful you can provide a little bit more color. What kind of areas do you think the customers are facing challenges in terms of maybe ramping up CoWos, maybe wrapping up SoIC. And where do you see from process control perspective, the biggest opportunities for KLA?
Richard Wallace: Yes. I'll give you some color just from 2 stories. One, years ago when we bought ICOS, part of the theory of that case was it was giving us exposure to the back end. And I remember meeting with one of our big customers and their back-end people, and they literally said to me, why are you guys talking to us about the back end, that's not a KLA market. And fast forward to the end of last year -- calendar year in a meeting that Martin and I had with a critical customer, they had 2 topics that we needed to talk about. One was our support of EUV and the ramping of -- continuous ramping of EUV designs and capabilities and the other was advanced packaging. And these are the folks that were historically and traditionally responsible for the front end. And one of the things they said is we think you guys have the capability in a lot of your front-end tools but we need that modified and we need to have for the back end because the back end is a critical part of our differentiation, and that's the part that we need you to work with us to take what you consider front-end tools and make it -- and what we're more concerned with the cost and this is often the case at the beginning of a node. They're more concerned with capability and then they were necessarily on cost. So the dynamic has shifted pretty considerably. And again, I go to one of the biggest drivers for all this is all the work that's going on with AI. And if you look at the success and the requirement to have advanced packaging as part of those solutions, that's what's driving it. So we kind of anticipated a few years ago this [ more than more trend ] was going to become more and more relevant. But we're seeing it very specifically with customers bringing front-end people that they've worked in the front end, having them work on these back-end challenges and asking specifically for capability that we have in the front end to be used in the back end. And in some cases, we've done that with some of our inspection tools and capability. But as you know, we have to make modifications to handling and some of the operating conditions to make that work. So we're definitely seeing that, and in some cases, our ability to support and modify those systems will be the gating item for us to realize revenue on it, not the demand. The demand is there. And from a competitive standpoint, we're uniquely positioned to do that. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity, and it's a major focus area for the company.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.
Christopher Caso: This is a follow-up question with regard to memory. And I think I understand what you're saying with regard to this year, perhaps some improvement in non-China memory, but nothing significant. I guess, what are your customers telling you to be prepared for perhaps as you're going into next year. We're starting to see some prices go up, utilization up. What's your expectation for the potential improvement in '25?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Chris, you're seeing all the things you want to see, right? You're seeing pricing improve, customers are taking up utilization. Utilizations were very low. And so there's a fair amount of capacity that's been out there. We're seeing the profitability improve and ultimately, that will translate into cash flow and then what we expect to be investment next year. I think we're seeing more in DRAM driven by the leading edge of DRAM or expect to see more there. And then, of course, the drivers related to its high bandwidth memory. But I think in some ways, it's the device market -- part of the market is improving this year, and that will translate into investment next year.
Christopher Caso: Got it. As a follow-up, with regard to service, I think last quarter, you talked about your expectation that being kind of the high end of a 12% to 14% target. Is that still the right way of thinking about it? Again, we've seen utilization rates improve here. Does that make -- does that change your view of where services come out for the year?
Bren Higgins: Well, it's certainly a factor in the growth that we're seeing this year. So I've been pretty open that I thought that we'd be somewhere between $250 million to $300 million of incremental service this year versus in 2023. And I think we're closer to the top end of that range than the bottom. So it is a factor. And given the nature of process control and the complexity of our systems, the mix and the relatively lower volume, our customers tend to rely on us to ensure that they're optimizing their capital, particularly in environments when capital is constrained, yields matter a lot. And so our utilizations never drop as much as process tools where they have more redundancy, but we are seeing it continue to improve. And so I think it's a good sign in terms of the overall market health and our confidence about some of the growth drivers into next year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.
Joseph Quatrochi: Wondering if you can tell me, obviously, you seem pretty positive in terms of just the opportunity looking into next year and thinking about the size of N2 and recovery in the memory market, I guess, how does the conversation with your customers over the last several months and just thinking about your lead times to give you confidence in your ability to reach that 2026 target model?
Bren Higgins: Well, I think our confidence is pretty good. We've made a lot of investments around the company in '21 and '22, both in terms of our own capacity, but also to ensure that our key suppliers have the capacity to support that kind of demand environment. So we -- it's one of the reasons why my inventory levels today are higher than -- and they continue to grow even where the market has corrected some because of the commitments we've made to ensure that the suppliers keep that capacity in place. So we feel very good about our ability to leverage what we have. I don't think we really have to make a lot of big investments to be able to support that trajectory. And I think we'll -- because of the investments, I think, frankly, they're a little bit of a headwind today in terms of the margins. So I think over time, the leverage opportunity is also compelling if we see the kind of growth environment that we expect over the next couple of years.
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay. As a quick follow-up, Bren, I was wondering if you could give us RPO exiting the quarter?
Bren Higgins: It wouldn't be a quarterly conference call without your question, Joe. So [ 9.9-ish ] we're going to file the Q in the morning or sometime tomorrow, I think, $9.9 billion. It was down about $750 million quarter-on-quarter. Deposits are about $677 million.
Operator: We will take our next question from Tom O'Malley with Barclays.
Thomas O'Malley: I think there's been a lot of discussion on the call about advanced packaging, and you guys have talked about how you had conversations already about potentially bringing some of your solutions from the front end to the back end. There's obviously some adjustments to those tools to get them ready. Can you talk about the timing of bringing those solutions there? Obviously, you're seeing a big growth rate in the back end. But from the moment that you say, hey, we want to take a tool and address the back end to when you're actually selling that to a customer. Can you talk about how long that takes?
Richard Wallace: Sure. And we had -- yes, let's be clear. I mean we have some of our products already from the front end that are being used in the back end. That started a while ago. We're just seeing an accelerated conversation about more tools where some customers will actually name specific tools that they want. So it very much depends on the tool and I can give you a range where it could be from 3 months, it could be a couple of years depending on whether you're modifying something that's already being used in that kind of application and specializing it. So it really depends. But I do think that -- we have some that are already there. So part of our $400 million is from tools that were from the front end. It's amount of -- probably half of those is actually in some of process capabilities from SPTS. So it's really -- those are examples where we have it. And then -- also the case is some of those tools need to be upgraded to the later specifications as customers move forward in technology. So that's why, net-net, it's a positive. It's a growth segment for us. We think it will continue to grow. Bren talked about the growth from last year, and it was a big driver for going back in time for the Orbotech acquisition was our belief that packaging opportunity was going to continue to grow. So that's where we are on it. But it's very tool-specific how long it takes to modify.
Bren Higgins: We also have new products that are going to support the substrate transition as the substrate integrates into the package. On the inspection side as the lines and spaces shrink in the connecting layers. It will drive the need for more capability for more advanced inspection and metrology systems. And so any time you add sensitivity, you add capability, there tends to be a throughput or a volume hit, so it creates an opportunity for us to sell higher ASP systems so they have more capability, but if you're going to maintain the same sampling rate, then you will need more systems. So it's all a factor in terms of all these factors that are all positive in terms of how we think about the long-term opportunities.
Thomas O'Malley: Super helpful. And then my second one is just kind of on the [indiscernible] that you've given for the year. So you said second half over first half, high single digits and you talked about kind of the mix of foundry/logic being similar to calendar year '23, about that 70%. If you take those clues, you obviously see some really strong growth in memory in the second half. Could you just help us with any color, obviously, from March to June, your DRAM percentage went down a bit in terms of its contribution to memory. But in the second half, how should we be thinking about the DRAM and NAND growth profile?
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think I don't think it's going to -- it will be a little bit stronger potentially in the second half than the first, but not much because like I said earlier that expected DRAM investments in China, I would expect in the second half to be lower than the first half.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] I'll take our next question from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James.
Srinivas Pajjuri: Sorry, I joined a little late, so if these questions have already been asked, I apologize. But I think last quarter, Bren, you had a customer push out that kind of impacted your revenue for the year. I'm just wondering if there's any change or any update to that customer if you're including that in the current year's guidance?
Bren Higgins: Yes, it affected the March quarter as we had some shifting around, frankly, affected a little bit the December quarter and the March quarter, but the shifting around to make the December quarter work, obviously, the shortfall was in March. So I don't think anything has really changed. I don't expect to see much activity from that customer until we get into '25. I mean, look, things could change, we could see some surprise. But right now, at least from a planning point of view, we put it in '25, and if it pulls in great, we can support it.
Srinivas Pajjuri: Got it. And then  on the 2 nanometer, I think your foundry customers are transitioning aggressively to get all around. Obviously, that helps you, but at the same time, I think the EUV layer count is going to be somewhat flattish. So I'm just wondering what sort of impact kind of it will have on process control intensity if you go to GAA and keep the, I guess, EUV kind of flattish in terms of layers,  should we expect any impact? Or is it kind of a nonevent for you?
Richard Wallace: It's an event. I mean, our customers are definitely -- so you think about the dynamic, our customers don't want to add process control intensity if they can avoid it, they also want to ramp and yield. So those are the -- that's the trade-off. So in the prototyping stage or the early pilot, they inspect more and they measure more in order to debug the process, if you will, and ramp it. And the question is how much do they have to maintain when they ramp and that's really what drives process control. They're definitely using more capability at the front end and there are some areas where they're going to have to increase their sampling or measurement to keep up with the additional challenges of smaller design node. And there's also some new capability to have to bring because of FinFET. And so we've talked in the past about modifications of a Gen 4 optical inspector to be able to support the FinFET. But it's not the only change in that process. So the EUV layers matter, but the process integration challenges are still going to be there. When we model it, though we do see an increase, we have different scenarios for how much process control intensity will go up. But it's consistent with -- we think there'll be a modest increase in the overall process control intensity for the leaders who have been successfully doing 3 nanometers. Anybody else that tries to jump to that node though, will see a dramatic increase in their process control intensity because they don't benefit from the learning of having done 3n volume. So in aggregate, depending on how many people are supporting it over time, it will drive our intensity up for our customers. We're also expecting a more robust design environment, certainly in the first few years than what we saw at 3-nanometer and likely a steeper ramp. So in addition to the challenges of just the gate-all-around architecture, what it means from inspection but also metrology, but also more volume, earlier steeper ramp and a more robust design environment, which will challenge the customers' process integration more than you see when you just have a few designs. So we're encouraged on a number of front.
Operator: We'll take another question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, I just had a follow-up on gate all around. Clearly, you have exposure to your Gen 4 optical inspection and the metrology for High-K metal gate. Is there a way to quantify what you think your gate-all-around revenues could be in calendar '24?
Richard Wallace: Yes. I'd be making it up, Chris. I mean we haven't -- we don't really look at it that and we do think about what is the node requirement. So from that standpoint, if you think N2, you'd attribute it all to gate-all-around. So we think about node intensity for process control and blended. And as I said in the prior answer, that's slightly up, but we don't have a specific number specifically around gate-all-round. But obviously, that's the big driver for the change and why customers are pushing for N2. And we don't know yet, but that's consistent with the 2026 model that we've had where we see rising process control intensity corresponding increase per share for KLA.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just like if I can squeeze one more in. Just kind of curious about your Gen 4 lead times. I think last time you said it was 7 to 9 months. Has it changed? If you assume that mature node is kind of slowing, China might moderate as the year progresses. Is there a view that the lead times are coming in? Or is it still like 7 to 9 months?
Bren Higgins: Gen 4 is highly demanded across nodes. It's a very configurable system. And in fact, we recently introduced a non-upgradable version specifically for gate-all-around.  So, it's a product that has a lot of extendibility. It's been challenged in terms of supply -- the ability to get supply to meet demand. I would say -- and we will see some increase this year in revenue from that system, which it hurt us last year just because we weren't able to get any incremental supply around key components. I'll see that increase this year. And so that will help. I still think lead times are probably in the 18- to 24-month range for that product, although we do a lot of juggling to make sure that we're in a position to support all of our customers. But it has demand on multiple fronts, and I think it's a testament to its extendability and the favorability of a broadband system, which has the ability to scale the [ wafer plants ]  to meet very different inspection requirements across multiple nodes.
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Krish. And I do think, Krish, you were referring to what we said about Gen 5, the 7 to 9 months a quarter ago, Bren. So I don't know on Gen 5, if there's any change there, but.
Bren Higgins: Gen 5 is in the same ballpark.
Richard Wallace: All right. So that brings us to the end of our call. We want to thank everyone for your time and attention. We know it's a very busy day. With that, I will pass the call back over to our operator, to conclude.
Operator: This does conclude the KLA Corporation March 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-01-25 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you for joining the earnings call to discuss the December 2023 results and the March quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. 
 We will discuss today's results release after the market close and available on our IR website, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Our full year references all relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP -- of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the earnings material posted on our website. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on 10-Q and 10-K.
 Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
 Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. I will briefly summarize KLA's performance for 2023 calendar year and the December quarter and then set up our view for 2024. For 2023 KLA revenue was almost $9.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. This was higher than our expectations coming into the year as strength from legacy node customers and semiconductor infrastructure offset weaker-than-expected leading-edge investments in both logic and memory. While overall WFE spending was down for the year, there were areas of growth in the KLA business segments, including the infrastructure business supporting wafer and mass manufacturers, automotive and specialty semiconductor process equipment.
 KLA's service business grew 7% to $2.2 billion for the year. The company continued to deliver strong industry-leading margins, with non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%. Free cash flow grew 6% in 2023 to a record $3.2 billion.
 Moving to KLA's December quarter results, which were ahead of expectations as revenue improved 4% sequentially to $2.49 billion. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.28 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. We saw sequential growth in all 3 of KLA's business segments. You can find specific details in our shareholder letter released earlier today.
 Additional highlights in the quarter include growing adoption for KLA's 8900 Series platform for high-throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in our optical inspection portfolio in 2023. Continued growth in AI enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. We continue to deploy deep learning and physics based algorithms across KLA's inspection and metrology product portfolio. This has improved signal and noise recognition and reduced process learning cycles as customers resolved critical yield challenges.
 KLA's Service business grew 1% on a sequential quarterly basis to $565 million and remained on track to resume the targeted 12% to 14% annual revenue growth trajectory in calendar 2024. As we look at CY '24, I'm encouraged by recent reports from many of our customers that the demand environment is expected to continue to gradually improve throughout the calendar year. Through collaboration with customers, KLA is focused on preparing our teams for a return to growth as the leading edge and leveraging the KLA operating model to ensure readiness to support our customers' needs as the demand environment improves.
 In the near term, we see the March quarter at the low point for the year, we expect business levels to improve as we progress throughout the year. The KLA team will, as always, prioritize commitments to our customers and executing on our product growth maps.
 I'll now hand the call over to Bren to provide more specifics around the financials and our guidance. 
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. Our results demonstrated the consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing and fluid requirements. Revenue was $2.49 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint of $2.45 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16, above the midpoint of the guided range of $5.26 to $6.46. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.59 for goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge.
 Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.6%, just above the high end of the guidance range of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.7%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million, GAAP net income was $583 million. Cash flow from operations was $622 million, and free cash flow was $545 million.
 As I just mentioned, during the quarter, KLA recognized a goodwill and purchase of intangible asset impairment charge of $219 million for the PCB and display reporting unit attributed to a weaker long-term outlook, primarily for the flat panel display business. We have begun investigating strategic alternatives for this business, which accounted to 1.4% of total revenue in calendar 2023. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
 Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. In December 2023, Fitch rating upgraded KLA's debt rating to A from A- with a stable outlook.
 Moving to our outlook. Looking ahead to calendar 2024, the exact timing of a meaningful and sustainable resumption in WFE investment growth continues to remain uncertain. Though there are signs of improvements in some end markets, this improvement is off low levels, impacting our customers' profitability and cash flow generation in the near term. KLA's overall demand is stabilizing around current business levels, plus or minus the guidance ranges. As of now, this translates into KLA revenue bottoming in the March quarter, driven mostly by a customer project delay occurring in the last couple of months.
 Based on current [ vast ] schedules and our June quarter shipment plan, we expect sequential growth to return in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of the calendar year. For calendar 2024, we currently expect WFE demand to be in the mid- to high $80 billion roughly flat to modestly up from the anticipated level in calendar year 2023. We expect that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half for WFE investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current top-down assessment of industry demand as follows: In memory, we expect WFE investment to be slightly up from low levels with investments focused on high bandwidth memory capacity and leading-edge node development.
 Both NAND and DRAM fabs are still a low utilization levels as consumer markets have not yet returned to the growth levels needed to bring factory utilization back to the high levels seen in recent years. Once customers consume this excess capacity and focus on node migration, we would expect to see new investments.
 Foundry/logic is expected to be slightly up with leading-edge investment returning to modest growth levels. Legacy investment declining versus 2023 and China legacy node investments remaining relatively flattish to current levels.
 As for guidance, KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $2.3 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be 40% of Semi Process Control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 15%.
 Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix weakens quarter-to-quarter due to lower overall semiconductor process control systems revenue. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range to what we delivered in 2023. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations.
 Operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $545 million, relatively flat from the December quarter. Our calendar 2024 operating expenses, we expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth per quarter beyond the March quarter, in line with expected sequential growth in revenue. Prototype material purchases can drive variability quarter-to-quarter.
 For the calendar '24 tax rate based on current forecast, we do not expect material changes. You should continue using the 13.5% effective rate for modeling purposes. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $45 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.93 plus or minus $0.60. A non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.26 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.6 million shares.
 In conclusion, we are optimistic that most end markets are showing signs of improvement. KLA will remain focused on supporting customers, executing on our product road map and positioning the company for a return of growth at the leading edge. The visibility into the precise timing of a sustainable demand recovery is still unclear, KLA is running the business to ensure delivery of a differentiated product portfolio that meets customers' technology road map requirements and to execute our business in line with our longer-term growth expectations.
 The KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have strengthened our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield at a high design mix volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite still challenging near-term demand trends.
 In the meantime, KLA business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain very compelling.
 That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. 
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you can just give the instructions and set up the queue. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: It looks like relative to your prior view, the March quarter came in lower by roughly about $200 million. I know you talked about a customer project delay that materialized just over the last couple of months. It looks like based on your December quarter end market mix and expected March quarter mix that it's a foundry/logic customer. Was that a leading edge or mature node customer, was the delay more technology-related or just weak demand trends? And does the sequential growth outlook beyond March assume that this customer comes back this year? 
Bren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. So yes, as we said in the prepared remarks, over the last couple of months, we had a project that we were planning to ship roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of business, too, that had a pushout that's extended, I think, somewhere around 12 months. So could we see it at the end of '24, maybe could be early '25 as well. So it was more leading edge centric. And as a result of that, as we backfill that business with other business, we did see the percent of China go up a little bit higher than we had thought we would see when we were giving guidance at the beginning of the quarter.
 So it was late in the quarter, obviously affected -- it didn't affect Q4 because of the moving around of other customers and slots but certainly had an effect on Q1. As we think about sequential improvement into the June quarter, we also have part of our revenue recognition policy is that when we ship to new customers, we have to go to acceptance to demonstrate that we can -- that our tools are meeting specifications around reliability and matching and so forth. And there are some shipments that we shipped at the end of Q4, and we're shipping it in the March quarter that are aligned with a couple of projects for new customers where the fabs are opening late in the quarter. So our ability to get those acceptances and complete that process could be potentially constrained.
 So we'll see that revenue shift into the June quarter once you get the established performance, then that revenue happens at shipment going forward with that customer. But we do have some unique dynamics that are affecting us here in the first half. So it does give me some comfort about the sequential growth guidance as we move into June. But it is affecting what we ultimately guided for the March quarter, consistent with our revenue recognition policy. 
Harlan Sur: No, I appreciate the insights there. Your total process control systems business outgrew WFE yet again, right, in calendar '23. Within that, Inspection significantly outperformed, right? It was only down 5%, but your Patterning business was down almost 20%, which is actually worse versus WFE. And it's like most of that full year underperformance was due to the sharp drop-off in patterning just in the December quarter. So was that tied to the customer pushout dynamics, as you mentioned? Or is it just the lumpy shipment trends in patterning? And I guess, do you guys expect process control systems business to outgrow WFE this year? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think -- if you think about our business and the composition and how it moves with customers, Inspection, especially the leading-edge Inspection is much more tied to development of new technology, whether it's in pilot or even ramp. And some of the metrology business is more tied to capacity. So when you see a falloff of capacity, it impacts metrology more than it would impact Inspection. And that's what we saw in '23. 
Bren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. On the relative performance, we do feel pretty good about the performance overall when you think about how much legacy business was in the year and how the leading edge fell off, which typically drives higher process control intensity. Also in WFE this year was a little unique in that there was a lot of carryover WFE from 2022 for a number of peers. And so that showed up in '23, it was really activity that we started in 2022. So when you take into account those factors and look at how well we performed in '22 relative to the overall market, we were -- our growth rate was 4x what the market was. 
 The fact that we're mostly, I think, in line, maybe a little bit better than the overall market in '23 is I think, a pretty good indicator of the growing process control intensity that we're excited about here at KLA. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: I just wanted to go back to the pushout. So that I just sort of understand, if we were to adjust for the couple of hundred million that's now pushed into the June quarter and assumed it was still in the March quarter, I guess, would you still expect that the June quarter would be up quarter-over-quarter? Or would it be more flattish like we were thinking or talking about last quarter, just the first half kind of still being a similar run rate of the business? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think it's more the latter, right? We've, obviously, got a lot of moving parts in how it affects the quarters. But as we talked about last quarter, we saw the business generally continuing at guided level. We guided was [ $2.450 billion ] right? We ended up outperforming by $40 million or so. So it would have been probably flattish, more or less. But this adjustment coming out obviously has the kind of impact, and I like sized it earlier. So flattish, and then we would expect to see the second half start to improve. 
Joseph Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're going to -- you'll file your 10-Q probably tomorrow, but any color on where the RPO stood exiting the quarter? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So RPO was down about $200 million. I expected you to ask that question, Joe. So yes, $200 million quarter-to-quarter and with about 50%. So that takes you to about $10.6 billion, 45% to 50% of it to ship beyond 12 months. And then within that, we have about just short of $800 million in customer deposits. 
Operator: Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Christopher Muse: I guess, first question, can you speak to domestic China? And I guess, to what degree '23 was helped by bare wafer and reticle inspection and your thoughts on how that progresses in '24. And I guess with the mix shift to perhaps maybe incrementally more DRAM. And I don't know in terms of the really core legacy some shift is there. How are you seeing your kind of implied market share '24 versus '23? 
Richard Wallace: So for China -- C.J. I think overall, for China it looks pretty flattish year-to-year. We did benefit from the infrastructure investment that I talked a lot about over the course of the last year or so. I would expect that part of the business to come down some as some of the digestion is happening more so on the wafer side than the reticle side. And so that obviously will get made up by what I would expect to be slightly higher [indiscernible].  I think the memory piece will shift to -- potentially shift to another customer. So I could see that being flattish overall.
 So feel pretty good about the trajectory of China. There is some lumpiness given our ASPs. But I think through the year, it will be relatively consistent across the quarters, notwithstanding the timing of certain fab projects and construction schedules complete and so on. And then I think we'll start to see the percent come down as we move into the second half as you see other customers drive our expected growth as we move through the second half of the year. What was the second part of the question, C.J.? 
Christopher Muse: No, you covered it. I guess, for my follow-up, as you think about kind of second half stronger than first half, how would you kind of rank order leading-edge foundry logic versus DRAM in terms of the key drivers for you? 
Bren Higgins: I think leading edge will be -- we'll see some growth in the year. It will be, I think, a fairly modest growth as we continue through the year. I would say -- I'm just kind of looking quickly here, I would say that it is reasonably balanced across the year. So I would think that we'll see -- I would expect to see DRAM probably be -- actually, I think it's going to be pretty balanced as well from a leading-edge DRAM point of view. So I think it's pretty balanced on both fronts. And then just ticking up a little bit as you move into the second half. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I have 2 of them too. One is, I was just kind of curious, Rick, if you can kind of give color how to think about China revenues this year ex EPC? 
Richard Wallace: Well, Bren just covered that, but -- in the last question, but essentially flattish. I mean that's the general view for China this year. Flattish, little less infrastructure than we saw, especially, in wafer and reticle continues to remain basically level at this current run rate. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. If I look at kind of like where your optical inspection is and you said that revenue should start improving over time. Where is the lead times today for them -- today versus, let's say, 3 months or 6 months ago? And where do you expect them to go over the next few months? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I'll start on that. On optical inspection, so we're still constrained on Gen 4 in terms of demand relative to our supply. I would expect to see supply increase this year. And that's part of our business, I would expect to do better than overall market as we move into '24. We have -- right now, I think we've seen some normalization around Gen 5 lead times, which tend to be somewhere between 7 and 9 months. But Gen 4 is still out over a year or so, but new capacity coming online. I think not enough for what we expect over the next year to 1.5 years. But then we have another tranche of capacity that will come online as we move into the '26 time frame. 
 So we feel pretty good about what we have in terms of overall capacity, both within the -- within KLA and our facilities, but also within our supply chain to support the growth that we expect as we move into '25 with more meaningful WFE growth. And then as we target 2026 financial plan that we laid out back at our Investor Day in '22. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. 
Brian Chin: I want to ask a few questions. Maybe just -- I think someone might have had asked this earlier in the queue, but taking your WFE sort of outlook for flat to modest based on your '23 base level, flat to modest growth this year, relative to sort of the pickup and maybe your revenue and WFE being sort of in the second half kind of modest, right? You probably would need to see an acceleration in the back quarters of the year in order to kind of get to say even towards the mid -- the low to mid-single-digit kind of growth that you're talking about for WFE at the moment. So I'm kind of curious, do you see process control intensity type of profile of spending this year sort of neutral in terms of WFE, do you think intensity is higher or lower, relative to this -- again that profile of spending this year? And then how does that reflect in your revenue? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. No, you're right in terms of the math, right? As we look at the first half of this year, which is we'll call maybe slightly down versus the second half of '23 and then an acceleration in the second half would put you somewhere in the, I'll call it, high single-digit growth. That assumes that WFE is marginally up more or less from 2023. And so against that backdrop, with slight improvement in memory, I would expect our process control intensity to be roughly flat. So we were in the 7% depending on your WFE number, but assuming you're $87 billion to $88 billion in WFE in '23, about 7.6% or so. So I would expect it to be similar as we move into '24.
 And as we expect to see more growth in leading edge investment as we move into '25, then we'll start to see favorability in terms of leading-edge dynamics that tend to drive our business and higher process control intensity overall. So I think that's how to think about it right now. 
Brian Chin: Okay. And then just given that emphasis this year on memory conversions and upgrade activity, can you comment on the areas where KLA benefits and how meaningful a benefit that this sort of spending represents? 
Bren Higgins: You mean in terms of just where we benefit in memory investment or we expect to see -- I mean, certainly, you've got the -- in DRAM with more DRAM investment with the introduction of EUV, that's tend to be a positive dynamic for our business. We saw process control intensity increase as we saw EUV introduced into DRAM. So that's probably one of the bigger positives for us. So you're right, as you start to do technology conversions, instead of new capacity, it will be a little bit more muted investment. But we would expect to see our customers continue to invest in the -- in their leading-edge development for the next nodes. And so I think that will be the biggest driver for our business. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. 
Christopher Caso: I guess, the first question is kind of looking beyond 2024 and, obviously, don't expect you to provide any guidance there, but take any opinion that you have. Some of the other equipment suppliers that have had longer lead times were starting to express a little more confidence on a turn on '25. I don't expect that you've seen that in your order book yet, but interested to see what your customers may be talking about. 
Richard Wallace: It's a great question. And we have definitely had those conversations. I think that customers are looking at from a couple of perspectives. One, we do have long leads on the most advanced optical tools, but there's also a lot of development that we're doing right now to make those tools even better for the advanced logic ramps that are coming. So we're actually engaged quite a bit in R&D and in pilot with those customers. So we have a pretty good sense. They're all bullish about '25. I can't think of a customer that we have on a leading edge that isn't bullish about '25. But as you say, we're not going to see the orders for those yet. But we're certainly having those conversations.
 But more importantly, we're seeing the discussions happen around capability that we're demonstrating as they do pilot. The other thing is we're seeing a trend toward more designs, and we talked about this for the past several years. One of the leading indicators for us is the advanced designs because that's an indicator of how broad a node is going to be. 
 And we're seeing that continue and that will drive both reticle business but also is a good leading indicator for the strength of '25. That's why one of the objectives for the company is to prepare for growth as leading edge because that's what we believe will happen over the next 24 months. As Bren indicated, not the next 6 months, we should start to see the green shoots of that toward the end of the year, and then we'll see it in '25 as the way we're modeling the business and our investment right now. 
Christopher Caso: Got it. That's very helpful. As a start-up, with regard to the foundry/logic business, would you characterize, and I guess, what you talked about your WFE assumptions is some kind of slight growth this year. Is it safe to say that, that growth is either tied to new node deployments and kind of technology upgrades and such as opposed to capacity at this point? 
Richard Wallace: It's a little bit of capacity, too. I mean '23 was down, right? And so we're seeing some expansion in our capacity. The big node ramps aren't really happening as much this year, which is part of why the WFE gets driven up. And you heard TSM's call, and I think they are fairly bullish on their forecast, but we'd have to see what happens in the early parts of '25 for those ramps on, especially, the newest technologies. 
Bren Higgins: And we would expect the legacy business non-China to be lower in '24 than '23. So there's -- so it's being offset. You've got some improvement with the leading edge investment offset by some of the non-China legacy falling off a bit. So that's how we get to our forecast. And we'll see as we start -- we're having these conversations with customers. We're certainly planning for it from a capacity point of view, and we'll see as we progress through the year as we start to firm up when those shipments will actually start to take place. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: You talked about memory utilization remaining low. And, I guess, I feel like you guys kind of talked about that relatively early, and then you saw it kind of static. We've heard from memory customers, all kinds of things about different times that they brought it down and like some of them bought it up. I just want to confirm that you're seeing that as kind of a steady trend? And then can you talk about how that affects your the services revenue you can get from those guys? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. But having met with a number of memory customers recently, there's a marked difference in their tone right now. And so when we talked to them last year, it was -- there's a lot of [indiscernible] looks about -- because they had been ready for a much bigger consumption of memory. And now I think they're starting to turn the corner on that. We do see conversion technology, but utilization is -- hasn't really changed much. Service continues to be higher than -- historically, we -- our utilization rates on our equipment are higher than historically, but because I think customers, even those that have the ability to flex down the utilization on our systems have chosen not to.
 And so that's been a real strength for us. And why services for KLA did so well in '23, and we expect that growth to resume to the numbers we targeted a couple of years ago for '24 and beyond. So I'd say the posture is different, and we're going to -- and we expect to see that continue to strengthen throughout the year. 
Bren Higgins: The customers don't have the same level of redundancy with what they buy from KLA versus a lot of process equipment. And when you're focused on trying to be as efficient with your capital as you can, you'll tend to really focus on trying to drive yield. So the way they buy process control, they don't buy a lot of extra. So they take capacity offline for a process, they tend to run process control much more consistently. The customers that cut more in terms of utilization earlier have come back more. I think overall, to Rick's statement, it's been fairly flat overall.
 And DRAM has tightened a bit because of some of the AI drivers for that. But on the flash side, I think it's been fairly stable. And like I said, some improvement from folks who cut more aggressively early on. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. 
Atif Malik: Bren, you talked about strategic alternatives for the display business. Can you help us out how big the display business was last year? And then in general, on the EPC business, there are kind of auto is starting to [indiscernible] mobility is getting better. Can you just talk about how you're looking at the EPC business, excluding display? 
Bren Higgins: You're breaking up a little bit there, Atif. So in regards to the comments on display, it's about 1.5% of the revenue of the company. And there are parts of display they are more commodity based and there's aspects of that industry structurally where profitability is more challenged. And then there's some interesting parts of it, too, in terms of some of the future road map opportunities and where some of the higher-end customers are moving. So we will have more to say about that as we assess the alternatives we're considering.
 The rest of EPC is kind of the tale of 2 businesses overall. The specialty semiconductor business has done exceptionally well as we talked about in the shareholder letter. Really outperforming WFE overall. I think it's a combination of customer engagement, more applications, new products. So we're really pleased with where we're performing there and the ability to differentiate. And I would expect that to be roughly flat and with some mix shift. It has some diversity in terms of end markets between automotive and mobile and advanced packaging.
 So you could see a shift where automotive weakens, we'll see more investment on the advanced packaging side. So we're pretty positive on that. ICOS, we're already starting to see some improvement there, which tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator in terms of finished components. And so we're more optimistic about how that will translate back into the other parts of our business, given that that's a short lead time, more capacity-centric business. So again, back to our views of some improvement as we move into the second half.
 PCB has been more mobile-centric in terms of in more consumer markets more capacity centric. So that business has been weaker, but I would expect it to be a little bit better this year as well. And there are some product offerings that we have coming that start to take advantage of opportunities at high-end PCB and substrates as those integrate into heterogenous packages. So we expect the APC business overall to be up, we'll call it, maybe high single digits, a little less lead time over there. So a little harder to forecast off of the year we had in 2023. 
Atif Malik: Great. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about uncertainty in leading edge with some push out. If your foundry customers decide to focus more in putting these investments of fabs in Japan versus U.S. Is there an impact to your business? 
Richard Wallace: Well, the work that they're doing in Japan is not at the leading edge, but it is part of their overall investment with the exception of the Japanese company that's investing there. So I would say, yes, of course, that's a different kind of business for us. It's important. But the leading edge business that's being done in the foundries isn't being done there right now with the exception of one. So we're talking about the -- what we're seeing and hearing is the development is going on for the leading-edge work. The question is, at what point will they be in a position to ramp that.
 So we -- the reason we're confident of the growth that's coming is because of the engagements we had, the design starts that we see and the plans that we know that they've been discussing. So we feel pretty good about the setup as we go towards the end of the year and into next year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. 
Yu Shi: First off, I really just want to ask for some clarification about the service business expectation for calendar 2024. I think that you talked about higher forecasted growth in service. Is it higher than what you thought at the 12% to 14% this year? Or if you're just talking about higher growth than compared with your systems business? Just a quick clarification. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, more in line with the long-term target model of 12% to 14% and closer to the high end of the target range. And that's really being driven by, we talked about some of the improving utilization that we expect to see as we move through the year, which if you think about our customers, their businesses get better. They have more demand, they start to consume the capacity they have. They have sustainability in that. And then as their profitability improves, then they start to invest in new equipment. So we would expect to see that play through as we move through the year. 
 But we also will start to benefit from the tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022 as they move from warranty into contract. And so that should be a driver for service growth as we move into next year. So we'll be back in line with the overall target model in terms of how we're planning for the business next year. The great thing about service is this growth that happens pretty continuously. It does have a little bit of a dilutive effect on our overall margins, which is one of the factors in the '24 gross margin color that I provided. So even if we would expect to see revenue increase a bit, I do think that you'll see a little bit of pressure on margins. 
 Now it tends to be based on the way we do the accounting accretive to operating margin. So it's -- at that level, it's pretty positive, but it does have an effect on the puts and takes within gross margin. 
Yu Shi: Maybe another question, maybe a little bit longer term. I think in the past, you talked about particularly some of your leading-edge customers reusing their capacity in the past and may put a little bit pressure a few cycles ago on your overall growth. Your largest customer, I think, last week, talked about maybe converting some of the 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer. We don't know whether they're going to continue to do that. But any thoughts there and looking a little bit ahead, do you expect any sort of negative impact going forward? 
Richard Wallace: The -- you're right. I mean historically, customers have always tried to reuse whatever they could. There's a couple of factors that impacted going forward. One is the technology that they're going to need for [ 3 ] and then for [ 2 ] is upgraded from what they have at [ 5 ].
 And the second one is they still have volume at 5. So the question will be -- historically, when this was the most pronounced was when there was a great fall off in an existing node going to a new node. So in our conversations with them and our modeling of it, we see it pretty consistent from what we've seen in the last few years, not as high as the reuse was several years ago.
 But that factor drives us to continuously provide more capability in the tool to give them incentive to go to the new technology or to upgrade the existing. So there's nothing specifically new about this upcoming next generation of new technology, but it is definitely something customers are always trying to optimize their footprint. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I wanted to ask about book-to-bill. So it's below 1 for the fifth quarter in a row. It's up a little bit. It's up to like 0.9. So you're reaching some sort of like steady state. But it's a much different dynamic of what's sitting in RPO than what used to sit in backlog because you used to have 4 to 5 months worth of backlog.
 And now if you assume half of the stuff is parked outside of 12 months and half is inside of 12 months, I mean it's not, I guess, that different than it was before, but you still have this $5 billion plus it's parked beyond 12 months and that was never there before. So as we look pre-COVID and post-COVID, what changed? Why is there this $5 billion worth of bookings or RPOs just parked beyond 12 months? Because it isn't like your lead times have gone out that far. And I understand that with those long lead times, but it has always been long lead times. So what's kind of changed for you? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think the easiest way to think about that part of it is it's related to customers giving orders that are tied to facilities that they're planning greenfield projects. And so the schedules are driving the orders. And so it's one of those where it is a lead time centric. It's -- the customer has a project that's going to open in '25, they want their tools when they have that scheduled planned opening. And so they've given us orders. In a lot of cases, you have some China business where you've given us orders and deposits that are tied to those schedules. So that's the biggest factor in the piece that's out.
 And you're right, it is a bit of a new phenomenon. I think that we started to see after the massive ramp that we saw from '19 to '22 or so. So -- and each quarter, it's been pretty consistent, and we've been [ cleaning ] up a certain amount of that backlog every quarter, but it's been pretty consistent and it's been roughly 50% or so. So in the quarter we just completed, if you notice, if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see the deferred systems revenue is actually a little bit higher, and that's related to the dynamic I talked about earlier, where shipments were higher than revenue levels. And that drove down the RPO, but the book-to-bill relative to the revenue was actually positive.
 So -- but I don't think that changes the nature of your question in terms of the trend line. It was a little bit better, more -- it's kind of consistent with what we thought and a little bit positive in the December quarter. 
Timothy Arcuri: Yes. Yes. I mean it was up, definitely. But I guess just my follow-up on that is what's the advantage? If I'm that customer and if your lead times are well inside of that, what's the advantage if I'm a Chinese customer to booking something that's kind of sit in your backlog it's -- but parked beyond 12 months? I mean, unless I'm worried about export control and maybe, I think, because I have something I've given you a down payment that entitles me to get the tool, like is that part of it? I still don't know why I would park something like way, way beyond your lead times? 
Bren Higgins: Well, if you're a new customer and you have new relationships with us, the demonstration of credibility in terms of, hey, we want this, we want to engage. We want you to put resources in place to support the fab and that takes some time to do so. And then in a lot of cases, that also comes with deposits for a portion of the orders. 
 So I think it comes down to you're one -- if you're one of those customers who want to ensure that when your fab opens, that this isn't a bottleneck or an obstacle to your ramp in your plant. So -- and in a lot of cases, if they're newer customers to us, these aren't our -- I wouldn't say that the customers you know are booking orders that far in advance. But there are certain customers that want to make sure that we're prepared to support their plans. And so they give us orders to ensure that they're credible on those plans. 
Timothy Arcuri: Well, that's a ton of customers that we actually never heard of before. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: I have 2 as well. The first one is on high NA. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect among some of your customers in terms of, I guess, their appetite to take tools and to develop using those tools. Curious, how you're thinking about your potential insertion of high NA over the medium to long term? And how should we think about the positive impact to your business from an intensity standpoint? 
Richard Wallace: Our views haven't really changed in terms of the timing for high NA. We're encouraged to see the shipments of the tools that were well publicized. And I think that's great. It is going to take a while of course, as with any new technology to get those up and into production. So really haven't changed in terms of our view of when that turns into pilot and then when it turns to the high volume. But one thing that's clear is the increased adoption of NA -- of EUV is good for KLA and the broadening of it, as we see it being more applicable in memory also creates more opportunities, not only just in the reticle space, but because we're now dealing with -- the deep activity challenges are greater as they start printing smaller features.
 It drives both the number and intensity of the tools that we need but also how they're run. So you need to run, for example, a BBP tool at a higher sensitivity, which, as you know, requires -- we keep adding capability, but it does require more capacity to cover the same amount of silicon to support that. So it's a very good transfer for Process Control and one that we're encouraged by. But from our standpoint, no change, which I guess is really good news because if we look back at EUV, it did delay several times. High NA seems to be on track with the schedule that has been out there for some time now. 
Toshiya Hari: That's very helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Bren. Just on the display business, so it's 1.5% of revenue last year. I'm curious if you could speak to the profitability of that business. I mean, to the extent you do end up, say, selling the business, how should we think about accretion to gross margins and bottom line earnings? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, profitability is less than 1.5 -- 1.5% of KLA. So it's 1.5% of revenue, the profitability is less than 1.5% of KLA's profitability. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you again, everyone, for your time. We know it's a busy day of earnings a busy week. We appreciate it. We'll be in touch with sure all of you over the coming days and weeks. And with that, back to you, Chelsea, to provide any final instructions. 
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation  December Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2023-10-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]
 I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the September 2023 quarter and our December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins, to discuss our results released today after the market close, which are available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials.
 Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified, our full year references all related to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
 Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosures in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
 Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick. 
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. Before we cover KLA's September quarter and outlook, I'd like to address the situation in Israel as it pertains to KLA. We have many KLA employees based in Israel. We're deeply saddened by the unspeakable acts of terrorism in the Middle East and the resulting war underway. Our heartfelt condolences are with all the victims and their families, friends and loved ones. At KLA, we're focused on employee safety and well-being and are making efforts to assist our teams through these terrible circumstances, including resources and support for our employees and broader humanitarian support through the KLA Foundation. We all hope for a peaceful solution soon.
 Moving on to our September quarter results, which exceeded expectations. Specifically, revenue of $2.4 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range. GAAP EPS was $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.74. Both also finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. These results were driven by the strength and relevance of KLA's process control portfolio. Additionally, focused execution enabled continued free cash flow generation and capital returns. We are proud of how the KLA teams continue to outperform in the marketplace and deliver on customer commitments.
 The overall business environment remains relatively stable for KLA. We continue to see strength in markets served by legacy nodes, despite softness in Memory and learning edge, Logic & Foundry investments. As the industry continues to navigate the slowdown in the electronics market, we are closely monitoring any adjusting results that affect our customers' capacity.
 KLA continues to outperform the industry on a relative basis because customer investment in R&D for technology advancement and transition has proven to be more resilient to market pressures. If we look at some specific highlights in the quarter, revenue was driven by strength in legacy node investment globally and industry infrastructure investment. KLA's market leadership, product success and unpatterned wafer, optical and macro inspection also demonstrate the power of the KLA portfolio.
 Rapid growth of AI, both enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. KLA is a pioneer in adopting AI to improve the performance of our systems and create differentiation. And KLA has a long track record of employing deep learning and physics-based algorithms in our core technologies. As the cost of compute has declined, we are now able to deploy this capability more broadly across our product portfolio, leveraging our AI expertise, KLA's inspection, metrology and data analytics systems help customers solve challenges associated with current process technologies and critical industry inflections, including gate all around, 3D memory, EUV Lithography, and advanced packaging.
 KLA Service business grew both sequentially and year-over-year, ending at $560 million in the September quarter and remains on track for high single-digit percent year-over-year growth in 2023. Finally, the September quarter was another excellent period from the cash flow and capital returns perspective, quarterly free cash flow was $816 million, which drove the last 12 months free cash flow up 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months were $2.4 billion.
 In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate our continued process control leadership and the success of our portfolio strategy. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, driven by the dedication of our global teams.
 I'll now hand it over to Bren to cover more details on our financial performance and our outlook. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered a strong September quarter, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging work marketplace. Revenue was $2.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.74 and GAAP diluted EPS was $5.41, with all 3 coming in at the upper end of the guided ranges.
 Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, 40 basis points above the guidance range due to benefits from a richer product mix and better service cost performance than model. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, in line with guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $311 million of R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.2%, non-GAAP other income and expense debt was $47 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.77.
 Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $786 million. GAAP net income was $741 million. Cash flow from operations was $884 million, and free cash flow was $816 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was a strong 104% and free cash flow margin was 34%. The company had approximately 137 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.
 The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides.
 Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.35 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt principal outstanding of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $726 million in dividends paid.
 I also wanted to highlight that on September 5, KLA announced an increase in the quarterly dividend level to $1.45 per share from $1.30, the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Since its inception in 2006, KLA has grown the quarterly dividend level at an approximately 15% compound annual growth rate. Additionally, on that date, KLA announced an incremental $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These capital return actions reflect confidence in our business model and growth strategy as we progress along the path to our 2026 financial targets.
 Moving to our outlook. As we review the market and assess relative performance of our peers across the industry, we are adjusting our Wafer Fab Equipment outlook for 2023 up to approximately $80 billion, reflecting a decline of approximately 16% from the $95 billion level in calendar 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear as most underlying end markets remain soft, we continue to see KLA's overall demand stabilizing around current business levels, and we expect this demand profile to continue into the first half of calendar 2021.
 KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology advancements and transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology roadmap investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership, and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance.
 As for guidance, our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.45 billion, plus or minus $125 million, Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 68%, and memory is expected to be around 32% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND 15%.
 We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus one percentage point, as product mix expectations are modestly weaker versus the September quarter and service period cost benefit realized in the September quarter normalizes. Inclusive of this guidance, calendar 2023 gross margins are expected to end up in the mid 61% range.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $540 million. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense, net, of approximately $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. 
 Finally, GAAP diluted EPS was expected to be $5.54, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.86 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 136 million shares.
 In conclusion, we remain focused on driving differentiation through innovation as we execute our successful portfolio strategy that supports our customers' technology roadmaps. Though the industry is correcting in calendar 2023 and sustainable demand recovery still remains unclear, we are sizing our business to ensure that we deliver a differentiated product portfolio that meets our customer technology roadmap requirements and that we have the capacity to execute our business in line with our long-term growth expectations.
 With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, we continue to implement our strategic objectives, which are here to drive outperformance. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital on a consistent basis.
 We are confident that Process Control's importance to enabling technology advancements bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite challenging near-term demand trends. KLA is well positioned to deliver strong near-term relative financial performance driven by the better-than-market performance of our Semiconductor Process Control and Specialty Semiconductor businesses and continued growth in service. KLA is also uniquely exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our relative outperformance in calendar 2023. Our business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact and are compelling. That concludes our prepared remarks.
 Kevin, let's begin the Q&A. 
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please provide the instructions to queue for Q&A, and we'll begin now. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. 
Vivek Arya: I wanted to revisit your suggestion that first half could be stable at this -- the December quarter levels. So does it mean you're not expecting any change to your China shipment? Or if you could just kind of give us how you are thinking about the mix in different end markets and geos. And then kind of part b of that is, what assumptions are you making about the timing of memory recovery? Is that still kind of second half awaited and can it be incremental to this kind of conceptual first half outlook? 
Bren Higgins: Vivek, it's Bren. So we are -- I'm not going to guide the first half of the year in terms of what regions or customers might be driving. As we look at the overall sales funnel and look how we're sizing the factories, our stabilization comment is at the total company level, we see the business roughly operating at about the guided levels here over the next few quarters. So we'll see how it plays out. Obviously, it's a fluid and dynamic environment.
 I think we'll see the semi PC business be very consistent with that. We'll see the parts of EPC tend to be a little more capacity and shorter lead time type businesses. So we'll have to see how that plays through. But as we aggregate and just as we look out, trying to give you as much as we can into the first half, we see the business bouncing along at roughly these levels. 
Vivek Arya: And anything on the potential recovery in memory, like if, let's say, memory were to be recovering in Q1, Q2, Q3, is that visibility you would necessarily have? Or if I ask it in a different way, what is kind of the difference between when you start to see it and when it actually starts to show up in your sales numbers? 
Richard Wallace: Vivek, Rick here. When we talk to customers and we have had several conversations with memory customers recently, they've all kind of echoed the same thing in terms of historical lows right now in the market and utilization continue to be less than what they're hoping for, although stabilized. So we don't have any indication of any near-term change in that. And they will certainly let us know because we do have long lead items. So there are some products we're still shipping based on the fact that they're for R&D work. But in terms of capacity increases, we have no indication of any near-term changes. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: On your Services business, close to 25% of your sales, you'll be driving high single-digit percentage growth this year, and that's with your customer production activity at an all-time low. But in your shareholder letter, you guys say that you expect growth in Services to accelerate to your target range of 12% to 14% next year. I know you've got to waive off tools and systems coming off of warranty and on to contract. This would be a big driver. But what else are you guys assuming on the strong growth outlook for next year? And what are your assumptions for industry manufacturing utilization? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. So there have been drivers or long-term drivers around service growth that are implicit in our modeling and are continuing, right, in terms of the level of utilization of the installed base customers using tools for longer periods of time and so on. But, you did hit on the biggest driver in terms of our expectations for growth into next year, is that we will have a number of tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022, where we significantly outperformed the market. Those tools will be coming off of warranty and moving into contract and our attach rate is pretty high.
 So it does give us some visibility into that service stream. As you know, our contract percent of the total revenue of service is over 75%. And so that visibility allows us to not only be able to plan for, but also to optimize the cost structure that's underneath it in terms of how we deliver to our customers. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. One other thing, Harlan, is that, as you know, our services isn't dependent on consumables. And so customers want to keep these tools up and going even when they have slower utilization in other parts of the fab, but then they definitely want to ramp them as they're bringing on new nodes and starting to ramp new technology. So it's kind of the best of all worlds in the sense we don't slow down that much when it goes down, but then they're going to want to ramp as activity continues, whether it's on new technology or beginning capacity ramps on new technology nodes. 
Bren Higgins: I think the final thing I'll say about it is Rick talked about memory utilization. If you look in foundry utilizations today, we are seeing some improving utilization to the leading edge and the legacy utilizations have -- depending on where you're at and kind of the N-1 is a little bit softer, more mature nodes, it's a little firmer. So utilization rates are stabilizing and increasing in certain parts of our business. And so that's an indicator for us as we look forward into 2024 in terms of additional growth for our service business. 
Harlan Sur: Great. That's hugely insightful. Given the strong lineup and aggressive cadence of tech transitions, right, especially in foundry and logic and that's obviously driving more EUV layer adoption, right, which is driving demand for both your optical inspectors, reticle inspection, your entire portfolio of metrology products as well. If we look into next year with more tech inflections, gate all around, introduction of backside power distribution, next-gen advanced packaging architecture, is that wave of new tools, systems adoptions to support these transitions. Is that still in front of the KLA team? Or are you actually starting to see quite a bit of that now? 
Richard Wallace: Well, so it's good insight, Harlan. I think there's 2 ways to think about it. One is we're definitely seeing R&D development around that, and we have for some time, but many customers have stalled their expansion and delayed. And as you know, there's been quite a lull in especially the leading-edge companies out there in terms of really much CapEx at all as it goes towards new technology expansion, but that's coming. And when that comes, we can map out layer accounts. We know we have a pretty good sense of deployment once it goes on the run card for these ramping up new nodes. And it's both on films. It covers both metrology but also it covers inspection. And so I'd say it's in front of us as we get into calendar '24 and [ beyond ]. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joseph Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: First is for Bren, I know it will come out in the queue, but can you help us with the RPO where that was exiting the quarter? 
Bren Higgins: It came down a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So you'll get the specifics in the 10-Q, which we'll be filing here in the next few days, but somewhere just north of $500 million. So still pretty high levels, north of $10 billion overall, but did come down a little bit quarter-to-quarter. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay. That's helpful. And then just in that kind of context, how do we think about the optical inspection lead times? I think you mentioned that the demand remains stronger than supply, your ability to supply, but how do we think about that looking into this first half of '24? Do we expect that you'll start to see maybe some of that alleviate in the first part of next year as we get into more demand into the second half? 
Bren Higgins: Because we've got some new supply coming on related to some extremely long lead time parts, I would expect that we'll ship more in '24 than we have in '23. And so we still have a fair amount of imbalance here between where our customer demand is and our ability to supply. But there is some catch-up that's happening there. But those lead times are still pretty long. The rest of the company somewhere around various across different products, more capacity-centric products. Lead times are very normal today and around some of the unique products that are critical in terms of industry requirements, those are still a little bit longer. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. 
Christopher Caso: I wonder if you can speak a bit about the China business right now. A little more color on the strength that you're seeing and you obviously heard this from your peers as well. And I think the investor questions right now are about the sustainability of the China revenue at these areas. I wonder if you could address that. 
Richard Wallace: Yes, absolutely. So a couple of thoughts for KLA in particular relative to China. Because of the actions that were taken, most of the investment, nearly all of the investment that all of that we're exposed to is on legacy nodes. And there's both mostly that's to support the industries that are in China where they want self-sufficiency such as EV, and you have a lot of projects going on that require basically greenfield. So you have a fair amount of inspection measurement across the board.
 But beyond that, there's infrastructure investment also going on in China relative to the legacy nodes, both [indiscernible] and also wafer manufacturing. Those projects, I think, are going to continue for some period of time. So what we don't see is any -- I think the leading edge stuff has already been taken out and they stopped that and of course, for a lot of reasons. But the legacy continues and it's pretty broad-based. And we don't believe that's going to change in terms of the size or intent of those, and those are things that are projects that are in various stages as they continue to build. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the business as we see it right now in China. And Bren can give more specifics. 
Bren Higgins: In the near term, in the September quarter, we saw the level as more elevated than what I'd call a run rate as we had other customers that were moving around in terms of deliveries. And so we were able to -- so we backfilled that with some of this demand in China. So it did push up a little bit. I would expect it would drop somewhat in Q4, but certainly remain at elevated levels. And it's certainly something that has strengthened over the course of the year, consistent with Rick's commentary.
 So as we look at next year, we've got meaningful backlog with these customers, I've got a -- in excess of $800 million in deposits for shipments for these customers. So I would expect that we'll see some sustainability of that demand as we move into next year. And I think it's really across the segments that Rick talked about. So as I think about growth into next year in that part of the business, I think from a baseline point of view, we see it's more or less flat.
 You have greenfield projects as you have construction dynamics that are influencing some timing issues. But in general, I would expect it to continue more or less at that level over a broader period of time. A lot of these orders we booked over the last couple of years and frankly, in the expansion period of '21 and '22, are more strategic and larger customers consume the bulk of our slots. So as we've seen some slowdown over the course of 2023, that's created a lot of availability for these shipments and these customers are performing in line with the commitments that they make. 
Christopher Caso: Just as a follow-on to some of the other things you said with -- as you're starting to fill some of those orders for, say, some of those Chinese customers that were -- you weren't able to fulfill because of some of the shortages before, what effect has that had on the backlog? And is your backlog visibility going out in time about the same as it was last quarter, a quarter before? Or is that backlog visibility is starting to shrink as you catch up on some of those orders that you weren't able to fulfill before? 
Bren Higgins: I would say with new business coming into backlog, that it's not changing all that much. 
Christopher Caso: Right. So about the same. 
Bren Higgins: I'd say, it's about the same. Visibility is pretty consistent. Like I said, construction issues would be probably the bigger factor of whether projects would push or not. In a lot of cases, these are our new customers that are getting established. And so aren't necessarily exposed to some of the economic sort of supply-demand drivers that would affect more established customers. Now there are those kinds of customers also, and we're seeing normal behavior from them in terms of how they're balancing their capacity given their customer [ demand ]. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. 
Atif Malik: Bren, in the past, you have talked about the China domestic spending as 1/3 memory makers, 1/3 kind of mature foundries and 1/3 as a new entrant into the market? And my question is like you're talking about China to drop somewhat in Q4, which segment of the China market you're seeing the drop off in Q4? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I'm not -- I don't have that detail here. There's another piece of that that's also related to the infrastructure investment that Rick talked about, the wafer infrastructure and reticle infrastructure. So there's also a component of investment that's happening there. I don't -- I'm not -- we guide at the company level customer-specific activity, I'm not going to get into that. 
Atif Malik: Got it. And then, Rick, I have a question on gate all around. Historically, you guys have benefited when the transistor move to FinFET architecture. And as we start to see initial orders on gate all around for some of the deposition companies, can you talk about what that gate all around opportunity means for both inspection and metrology for KLA? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, great question. It means a couple of things. One, obviously, gate all around has been in development for a while. So we had start in terms of some of the architectures that we need to modify to support it. Specifically, we're leveraging Gen 4 technology instead of Gen 5 because of the nature of the contrast, ability of Gen 4 to see the defects that are relevant to gate all around architecture. We've made those investments and seen those results, and that's been one where we've leveraged existing technology but also leverage the work we talked about with AI, to provide capability. So we're well prepared for that when it comes to the inspection challenges associated.
 Metrology, big opportunities there because you're looking both for increased level of precision when it comes to the actual measurement, larger sample size because of the concerns about consistency across the wafers and across wafer and wafers, and also some of the specifics around the High-K Metal Gate control that people are looking for.
 So more capability. Again, we had a head start because as you know, that technology has been in development. So we've worked with development partners on that, feel well positioned to be able to support that as it expands. So it's going to help both process control intensity when it comes to both inspection and with metrology, and we're well positioned to support our customers to do that. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: I want to ask about the DRAM strength that you guys are seeing. It seems like that was the main source of revenue upside in the quarter, and it looks to be -- based on your comments, down slightly in the next quarter in [ calendar ] Q4, how much of that strength is coming from shipping to the DRAM customers in China that you alluded to in the past? And how much of that is tied to advanced DRAM technology, high bandwidth memory and whatnot. And when you look at Q4, which part of that segment is going to come down? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So when I look at the details, certainly, the shipments into China, which were expected were a driver from the baseline. As I look at the December quarter, in DRAM, I think you'll see a little bit of a mix across customers, but I don't think the number really -- the absolute number doesn't really come down all that much. So most of the investment is in that area or it's in the area that you alluded to, right, in terms of supporting some of the AI demand that's out there. But -- and then you get just general R&D investment that's happening. So it's a pretty low level overall and the bulk of it coming from some catch-up related to the China customer that we referred to. 
Richard Wallace: One other area, we are seeing some when it comes to the interposer in terms of packaging-related [ HDM ]. So that is also a driver -- smaller at this point, but the growth projections are good. Remember, as DRAM is going to leverage EUV as the investment resumes, that's going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to penetrate when it comes to the R&D, but that's not what's driving it right now. 
Sidney Ho: Okay. Great. And maybe a follow-up for me. If you look at the SPC systems revenue, it looks like it's going to be down 5% to 7% in calendar '23. I think a quarter ago, that number was like down 10% to 12%. Can you talk about what has changed? Is it just that the WFE market has improved somewhat? Or are there other KLA specific reasons that you will point out. But more importantly, how do you think that outperformance will do next year considering some of the areas that you are strong in this year may see some moderation? 
Richard Wallace: I'm sorry, for EPC or that was SPTS? 
Sidney Ho: Yes, that's for SPC. 
Richard Wallace: Okay. Got it. Look, we had some strength -- we continue to have strength, kind of the same things we talked about strength in optical. I think the process control intensity hasn't slowed across our customers, and we continue to see wafer being strong, we talked about macro being strong. So it's really across the portfolio of leading-edge. The thing that's falling off the most when it comes to capacity has been the product areas that are most linked to wafer starts and those would be things like overlay and films. But when it comes to the technology inspection, continued strength there. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. And I think the infrastructure parts of the business as well. We've seen that hold up fairly well, both in China, as we talked about in terms of doing mature, we're building capability to not only provide wafers, but also to do mature reticle sets for all the design activity that is happening. So you've got that. But then on the wafer side, you also have investments that are happening globally as those customers prepare for not only as capacity comes out fairly slowly in that industry, preparing for the resumption in demand that we're expecting here in the near future, but also different strategies around inventory stocking, more wafer-to-wafer bonding other demand for wafers.
 So that's also been a driver that we've seen hold together fairly well as we move through this year. Process control intensity is helping in, I've been pretty open with it over the course of the last year that despite some catch-up that might happen with some peers related to challenges in '22 with supply, we felt pretty good about our positioning and our exposure to some of the fastest-growing markets overall. The mix of business that's more logic/foundry-centric and this infrastructure exposure that I referred to. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick or Bren, I'm curious, you mentioned like the demand profile stays in the first half of next year. But some of your peers have called calender '24 like a transition year. And how do I overlay the fact that memory could rebound in the back half of next year, how to think about these industry WFE or KLA revenue profile next year? 
Richard Wallace: So I'll take part of it and Bren can answer. We don't know what '24 is going to look like. We just don't know. And we know what our customers are saying right now. But they don't really know yet either. So we're talking about a sustained level of business kind of being similar to what it is right now until we have a reason to believe it's going to go up. Customers talk about things improving. We have meetings and they talk about asking us to get ready. But until we actually see it happening, we don't really know. So it's very hard to talk about the levels.
 What we do know is you have historically low levels of investment company right now in memory, and we see the same thing as you do in terms of pricing. And then we're well positioned for ramping when it does ramp. We also know we have some very good indications on some of our long-term products that are products that have long lead times. But as Bren said, like an optical inspection or capacity constrained, not demand constrained on those. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We don't really have any unique visibility into '24 than those general trends and the fact that utilization seems to have stabilized and is increasing on some of our market segments, but not much visibility beyond that. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Look, I made the comment about utilization rates, and I think that's encouraging in terms of the stabilizing environment that we're articulating here. that's certainly a factor. Well, of course, we watch our customers' business models, their profitability, their cash flows, that will, okay, you're seeing the industry digest the capacity that was added and then get sort of healthy again and see pricing and all those things improve. But then one of the catalysts that are going to drive growth into next year.
 In our near term, as we said in the prepared comments, we see roughly this level of business as we move through the first half of the year. One of the things that we really focus on is we've got to make sure that we're flexible enough to be able to respond. And so we've made a lot of investments over the last few years in our supply chain and our own capacity to make sure that we have the flexibility to respond because I would expect that we could get surprised. We usually do.
 And so we want to make sure that we're in a position that we're not -- we're not constrained in our ability to supply and meet that when it happens. So that's our focus. And I think the color we provided in terms of how to think about the company and how we're sizing the company in the near term is reflected in [indiscernible] 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. And then a quick follow-up. As you said, the recent export control work has no material impact to your outlook? 
Bren Higgins: And so we're looking at that and working our way through it. It's quite complex. But preliminary estimates based on the -- I'll call it, the baseline that was established in October of last year. Right now, we don't see any real material change to our business expectations related to those new regulations. But we're working our way through it, it's complex. 
Operator: Next, we'll have Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, everyone's asking about 2024 WFE, but I guess I'm still a little confused as to what the right baseline is for this year, because pretty much everyone has now guided for Q4. So if I take you, plus Applied, plus Lam, yes, it's down 13%. So that would mean that your $80 billion number might be in the ballpark off of that mid-90s last year. But if I include ASML, it's like flat. I mean even if you exclude the fast shipments, it's fairly down. So how is WFE down this year? I guess I'm just trying to get some understanding of like how you get to that $80 billion number. Is it excluding ASML somehow? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim, we're not experts on this. What we do is we take a look at what -- we look at the universe of peer companies and how they report. If you look at what our customers say, we have some modeling that we do. And we come up with an estimate for that. So this year is a little hard because of fast shipments, and I don't even really understand all the nuances in that and that's for you guys to figure out. But also some of the issues that affected some of the other providers in late '22 in terms of their ability or inability to deliver in '22 and how that shows up in '23.
 But when we look at how we're performing overall, we think that it's in and around that low. Certainly, the fact that we're down given our belief about our market position. And if you look at Semi PC based on the guidance we provided being somewhere around down, we'll call it, 9%, 10%, somewhere in that ballpark. It doesn't feel flat to me. 
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. All right, Bren. And then I guess my second question is on inventory. It's now up to almost 300 days. It's up like $500 million over the past 6 months, but we're not really sure when WFE picks up inside of next year. I get that you still have this huge $10.8 billion worth of PO that you're kind of working off. But why is this stuff parked so far out in the future? Is it -- and if so, why hold the inventory now? What's the bottleneck? Is there something on your side still that's a bottleneck? Or is it more that the orders have been placed and maybe waiting for the fab, to be ready to take the equipment and that's why you're building up the inventory. I guess I'm just not sure why you would build the inventory if this stuff is still parked so far in the future. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim, it's a great question. It's a little bit of the trade-off that we make, and I spent a lot of time talking about how we were able to outperform the industry for a couple of years in a row in terms of some of the supply chain challenges that others were facing that we weren't. Part of it has to do with how we manage our suppliers. We do have a lot of long lead time parts and so if you just go back to, we'll call it, 15-months ago, we thought 2023 was going to be a growth year on top of what we thought was going to be $100 billion year in 2022. So, we had made commitments. We were putting commitments out longer to get our suppliers to invest. We've invested in them in terms of partnering on their capacity expansions.
 We manage our -- so I place those commitments to suppliers, we've been able to manage what we can, but in a lot of cases, we honor our commitments. And we feel that in the long run, we're in a good position in terms of the longevity of our platforms and where we expect demand to come from that will consume those parts. So some of it is what you're optimizing for in terms of our differentiation in terms of how we work with our supply chain, and we're accepting that we're going to be pretty good customers. We're going to move up to our commitments and take the parts that we've committed to. So we feel pretty good in the long run about our positioning in terms of our ability to grow when we see a reacceleration from the industry.
 And the other issue is that our service business continues to grow, right? It grows every year, and that growth drives a fair amount of demand in service. It's a high complexity, high mix, low-volume business. And because of the customization of the parts, we tend to have to do end-of-life buys and have to buy a lot of parts to support that business. When you look at our margin profile overall for the company, feel like the trade-offs we're making are appropriate. And we think it's played a big role in our relative success. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. 
Yu Shi: This morning, I think one of your smaller peers in Europe, they talked about seeing some weakening of the mature in foundry/logic side of the WFE. I wonder if KLA is seeing something similar. I mean either through your process control business or the EPC business? If not, why is that? And I have a second question. 
Bren Higgins: Not really. Look, we're watching for certain parts of, I'll call non-China legacy exposure to automotive, industrial, some of those markets to see if that has an effect on customer demand. But right now, our expectations around legacy in the near term has been fairly consistent. 
Yu Shi: Got it. So Bren, maybe a question on OpEx. Both of your peers in the bay area, they are raising their OpEx for basically the next calendar year. How should we think about KLA's OpEx going into next year, say, you talked about you're expecting revenue to be run rating at the current level, should we be thinking OpEx is kind of flat until you see the uptick in the revenue. I mean before you really raise the OpEx. 
Bren Higgins: Run rating at the current level does give you a little bit of growth into next year. And as I said, we would expect to see growth in Service. I actually think EPC probably has some modest improvement off of pretty depressed levels. Our incremental operating margin model drives how we're running the business in terms of expectations for leverage on incremental revenue. So I would expect to see a modest uptick in OpEx. We're also balancing sort of near term in terms of how we're sizing for the current environment, but also our long-term investment, requirements.
 And given our market position and our desire to go to market with the portfolio that we think is a competitive advantage for KLA does drive some requirements for investment. And we'll do that independent of topline when appropriate. But as we're looking out going forward, I would say that we'll probably see OpEx tick up a little bit as we move through '24, but not a big change, more in line with general kind of cost to living type adjustments overall. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: You talked about maybe a little bit of weakness at the cutting edge of foundry logic. Wondering if you could talk about that. And then I guess, just contextually, if we're in an environment where there's very aggressive investment in gate all around and backside power, but there are sort of limited wafer requirements in year 1 for those technologies. I would think that helps KLA in terms of percentage of WFE, but can you just walk us through how much of your -- how much money will they spend on the development of those processes versus the expansion of wafer, that capability there? 
Richard Wallace: Well, so we still -- we do get investment at the front end, but for more for development, but the ramp phase is really where you see -- that's where you see more of it. So you get it at the front when they're doing development and then this starts to ramp to get more. And we get less incrementally across the portfolio as you are in high volume. So yes, it would help us in terms of intensity around those new nodes, but often, those companies are also expanding the trailing nodes at a similar time, one or two generations. So on balance, doesn't look that different overall as most of these companies ramp up at if that makes sense.
 So you get it at the front end, but the rest of the -- so you look at process control intensity, it doesn't really change that much in foundry/logic year-to-year because they're investing across multiple parts. The biggest change has come from the mix of foundry/logic to memory. And memory is increasing some. So yes, there are more layers, there's more investment going on, but it's still balanced by they're going to ramp. We hope not just the R&D, but they're going to be ramping in terms of across the board. That's how we get to the model that we found for 2026, is based on process control intensity, inching up over time as processes just get more challenging. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. The roadmap schedules have held pretty well together. What we've seen is customers adjusting some of the capacity plans. So as you look at 2024, you're more likely to see, for example, more N3, you're going to see N2 activity and we'll start to see some of that soon. And -- but most -- the bulk of it will be more at N3. What you likely don't see is you probably won't see a lot of investment from our major customers and some of the more legacy parts of their businesses, where they pull back.
 But to Rick's point, we're seeing some of it. We'll see that investment as they ramp. We're seeing more investment today in production given the number of designs that are moving through the leading-edge nodes and the different process flows is creating opportunities for or -- and more challenges for our customers in terms of process control and defectivity challenges across different designs as they test design rules in different ways. So I think we have our normal historic exposure to R&D and to ramp. But over the last few years, we're seeing, particularly with the introduction of EUV and the progressing of scaling we're seeing more adoption in what we call the HVM or the high-volume manufacturing phases. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. 
Blayne Curtis: I just wanted to follow back up on the comments you just made on foundry logic. So it was flat. It seems like China is probably up within that mix, and then you said leading-edge is weak. I'm just kind of curious how that changes for December. It seems like the outlook is fairly flat. So is that weakness in leading-edge kind of stabilize, and then kind of any perspective as to where leading-edge goes next year? 
Bren Higgins: So I feel like where we are today, I think your stabilization comment is the right one. I think we've derisked it and given that we tend to be more of a long lead-time provider. I think we've made a lot of the adjustments that we needed to make already in terms of how we're planning for this year. And as we move into next year, right, I think if you just sort of aggregate leading-edge activity, we'll see as customers start to provide a little bit more insight. But again, back to the stabilization comment, I don't see it declining from here. 
Blayne Curtis: I just want to ask on Service, in your letter, you talked about getting back to that 12% to 14%. I just want to know, is that assuming any utilization increases? Or is that just purely the tools coming off of their agreement? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, it's the latter. I think we're expecting utilization to slowly improve, but the bulk of it will come from new tools coming into contract. I think to expect to start to see overall industry improvement into '24, the first thing you'll see is utilization start to improve. So we would expect that and then once you see that, and then eventually, utilization gets to a place where customers need new capacity and then those decisions happen. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Just a quick follow-up. As you think about the R&D price, especially you highlighted gate all around at some point, we have to change the narrative to High-NA. And I want to just get an update, how do you see kind of opportunities as it relates to High-NA specifically on the patterning? And I have a follow-up. 
Richard Wallace: Well, I mean, what High-NA enables is the continuation of scaling, right? So that's been good news for KLA. You notice process control intensity in general, but more specifically for KLA has gone up as EUV has started to be adopted because now you're scaling -- we're not on what was traditionally Moore's Law, but we're seeing scaling. So High-NA means there's going to be more scaling happening, and that's going to be good and specifically good for KLA because it drives the highest performance requirements, which plays to our portfolio strength.
 So part of what our modeling is when we book -- we don't see a lot of High-NA happening in the timeline that we laid out for 2026 for our Investor Day, it's after that. But we'll see early stages of it before 2026, and that will drive -- continue to provide more opportunity for us to participate in higher process control intensity. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Are you implying that Gen 5 could be -- the use of Gen 5 could be extended to High-NA for patterning. 
Richard Wallace: For sure, absolutely. We're still using Gen 4. We're using Gen 4 now because of the extensions that we made in the platform, not just in terms of wavelength but adding more processing capability, the leveraging of AI, the use of both Gen 4 and Gen 5, actually Gen 4 will out-ship Gen 5 this year, and we'll continue to see that adoption.
 So it really is talking about the critical layers and we have more extensions in mind in the -- on the works that we're doing right now for Gen 5 that will extend it well into the even in the High-NA, then hyper-NA, which is going to come after that. So we feel very good about our optical product portfolio. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then the second follow has to be on China, it seems like for KLA and the peer group, the China mix is getting closer to 50%. Could there be a scenario where opportunities for KLA would actually step up given the fact that many of these customers are new, and they have yield issue. And I understand China is mostly for [ trading-edge ], but with new entrants, new players, with the higher entrances and improving yield by these new players, have a higher mix of China for KLA relative to the peer group? 
Bren Higgins: Well, you have a lot of customers that are subscale, that are trying to develop process capability and demonstrate capability to customers, also invest for viability over time in terms of longer-term node progression. So in early stages, upscale stages like that, you're going to see a heavier investment in process control. Now as they continue to put roadmaps, it might stay there because they never really had a huge meaningful amount of capacity at each node.
 But you do see higher levels of adoption early on as you're trying to -- because if you think about it, you might buy a few process tools here and there, but you need the whole suite of process control. And so that's why we tend to see a little bit more activity there. But I think given the desire to progress along roadmaps into progress nodes, you're going to see, I think, a continued level of investment overall. But certainly, as you start to mature and if you're running a limited number of designs, process control intensity will higher in production than it used to be, is still lower than it is in what we'll call the ramp phase of a project. 
Operator: Our last question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. 
Brian Chin: I'll just ask one question then get us out of here. But -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I've gotten a sense maybe that given how strong the infrastructure bear wafer and reticle inspection business into China was this year that it could subside a little in the calendar '24 relative to its strength again this past year. Is that sort of implicit in your outlook in the first half next year? And also, do you think that is proportional in any way to sort of the rate of China fab bill out activity that you can maybe observe for next year? 
Bren Higgins: Well, I don't think it's -- I think the overall wafer infrastructure investment will -- that's been faster than WFE growth this year will flatten out as we move into next year. So there's -- that starts to slow down. On China specifically, though, I don't see it changing much. I don't think it's going to grow much next year, but I don't see it falling off. And that's across for silicon wafer but also around reticle capability. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you Brian and thank you Chelsea. I just wanted to thank everyone again for their time and turn the call back over to you for any final instructions. 
Operator: This does conclude the KLA Corporation's September Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-07-27 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead, sir. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the June 2023 quarter and our September quarter outlook. Joining me is our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close, along with supplemental materials that are all available on our IR website. 
 Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. 
 Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. 
 Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. 
 Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. 
 KLA's June quarter results exceeded expectations and demonstrated consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Specifically, revenue of $2.355 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range, declining 5% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. 
 GAAP earnings per share was $4.97 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.40, with each finishing at the upper end of their respective guidance ranges. As near-term demand headwinds persist, there are some bright spots. In particular, automotive and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong, demonstrating the diversification of demand and growing adoption of semiconductor technology across multiple industries. 
 Additionally, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers to execute on node and technology transitions that are the focus of R&D efforts, and that is more resilient to near-term pressures. We work closely with our customers and they continue to prioritize R&D investments. This is important for KLA as our products are heavily relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase when faster time to yield is critical. 
 KLA remains focused on supporting our customers' requirements while maintaining critical R&D investments to enable our technology road map. Our June quarterly results are the latest example of successfully meeting or exceeding our commitments and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Specific factors driving KLA's performance this quarter include KLA's market leadership in process control, which includes some of the most critical and fastest-growing segments of WFE.  
 Growth and market leadership in critical wafer and reticle infrastructure is fueling relative growth for KLA. For example, revenues from our unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology products used in silicon wafer and photomask manufacturing are expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE market and deliver strong growth in a down year for the industry. 
 The KLA Services business grew to $539 million in the June quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continues to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet customer requirements. 
 I'll now hand it to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA delivered results at the upper end of the range of guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution despite a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. 
 Quarterly revenue was $2.355 billion towards the upper end of the guided range of $2.125 billion to $2.375 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.40, also towards the upper end of the guidance range of $4.23 to $5.43. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.97, above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, 45 basis points above the midpoint of the guidance range due to product mix as upside in the quarter was driven by higher-margin products, normalizing freight expenses and improving factory utilization as overall capacity adjusts to current demand expectations. 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $543 million, slightly higher than guidance due to adjustments to variable compensation. Total operating expenses comprised $314 million in R&D and $229 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Other income and expense net was $49 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 12.4%. With the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.07 lower or $5.33. 
 Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $743 million, GAAP net income was $685 million. Cash flow from operations was $959 million and free cash flow was $880 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was strong at 119% and free cash flow margin was 37%. 
 The company had approximately 137.7 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. 
 Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.24 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; debt of $5.89 billion; and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
 Turning to our outlook. Our WFE outlook for 2023 remains largely unchanged at down approximately 20% from $95 billion in 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we continue to see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business and we expect this demand profile to continue through the remainder of the year. 
 Our 2023 WFE estimate reflects a tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by approximately 40%; foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall, with legacy investment outperforming the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes. 
 KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. 
 In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high-level investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. 
 Moving to guidance now. Our September quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.35 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 70% and memory is expected to be around 30% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 90% of the segment mix and NAND at 10%. 
 We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat at 61%, plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix expectations and cost components are consistent with the prior quarter. Given our current view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of 2023, we expect full year calendar gross margin to trend near 61%.  
 Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $535 million as cost measures executed earlier in the calendar year align our current cost structure with top line expectations. We would expect quarterly operating expenses to remain around this level for the remainder of the calendar year. Other model assumptions for the September quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $48 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. 
 Finally, GAAP-diluted EPS is expected to be $5.02 plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.35 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully-diluted share count of approximately 137 million shares. 
 In conclusion, we continue to see process controls' importance to technology transitions and advancements key to R&D growth and prioritization despite persistent weakness in our customers' businesses. We are also exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our revenue performance. 
 As a result, KLA remains positioned for strong relative performance versus the industry in 2023. Looking ahead, we continue to see the business environment stabilizing and remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain strong and compelling. 
 Broadening semiconductor demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across multiple technology nodes remain catalysts for sustainable long-term industry growth. Multiple applications for leading-edge road maps are driving competitive dynamics and design challenges requiring more customer engagement and faster time to results. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have at lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. 
 While a global economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges, KLA is well positioned to deliver strong relative financial performance, driven by better than market performance of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We remain focused on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. Per the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will implement our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives are also the foundation for our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. 
 Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence continues to enable us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance, while delivering consistent capital returns to shareholders. That concludes my remarks. 
 I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide instructions and queue for questions? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the strength that you're seeing in your blank wafer business. How do you see that looking into next year? And is there a risk of maybe some digestion after a pretty strong investment cycle there? 
Bren Higgins: Joe, thanks for the question. This year has been a strong year for that. We have a very strong market position there. So that's been good for us. And you're seeing investment from the global players, but also investment in infrastructure in China to provide more domestic supply. It tends to invest according to a different cycle. I wouldn't exactly call it countercyclical. 
  But the lead time to get equipment to actually make silicon wafers takes some time. And so you see those customers continuing to invest through to prepare for future demand. They're also dealing with new capacity requirements related to hybrid bonding and some of the other wafer-to-wafer packaging techniques that are out there that are driving incremental demand as well. 
 So as we look at this year, it's going to continue to grow this year, expect it to do well. And then -- but I do think as we move into next year, we'll see some moderation of that investment. So while I don't think it will fall off a lot, I don't think we'll see it grow into next year. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you guys saw some pretty, I think, significant upside to your memory kind of expectations or at least relative to what you were thinking 3 months ago, and particularly around DRAM. Just wondering if you could maybe comment on what drove that in the quarter? 
Bren Higgins: Sure. We had some movement across a number of our customers, and the number overall is, frankly, pretty low. But that was part of it. The other part is we also had some shipments that we weren't expecting to make in the quarter related to 1 of our Chinese DRAM customers. And a clarification of some of the export rules enabled us to ship some additional equipment there. So that was a factor in the upside on the DRAM side. 
Operator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, can you update us on where optical inspection lead times are? And given the importance of that tool set for R&D lines, is that something that you expect will sustain at elevated levels? Or do you think that should normalize over time? 
Richard Wallace: C.J., it's Rick. The answer is the demand continues to be very strong and for a couple of reasons that we've talked about many times. And we have struggled in increasing the output. So we're still booked out through, as far as we can see, into next year. So business remains strong. The product has had a lot of success dealing with some of the challenges we're seeing. So we expect that to remain elevated and we're working hard to actually increase capacity in order to meet that demand, but that's going to take some time. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Lead times will come down a little bit. I don't know if they'll come down all that much, given the drivers of that product line. But as new capacity comes online as we move through '24 and beyond, we'll see it -- we'll see them come down a little bit, but I think you'll still see them remain elevated for some time. 
Richard Wallace: One of the nice -- we talked about in the past, C.J., is that we're still running Gen 4 in addition to Gen 5. And Gen 4 is really seeing pretty good adoption in places that we didn't necessarily forecast, like automotive. So we still have pretty good tailwinds for that. 
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, encouraging to see your Semi Services business grow sequentially. Can you kind of comment on how you see that playing out in the second half? And what kind of potentially negative impact are you seeing from lower utilization from your memory customers? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. We're very pleased with the performance in Services. And it's not atypical for us in a downturn to see Services utilized because people are still trying to squeeze out all the yield capability they have. We have seen utilization. We had forecast from some customers for a higher level of -- or a lower level of utilization, asking us to back off a little bit. 
 And those have moderated through the year to the point where utilization rates are higher than what had been forecasted by our customers at the beginning of the year, specifically in leading-edge logic/foundry. So that has been an upside. Memory looks a little bit slower in that regard. But it's kind of what we forecasted. And with the level of shipments, we feel very good about our long-term forecast for the Services business. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I chose -- the first one, Rick, obviously, you have like very strong revenues from China. There's been some chatter that the U.S. might expand export controls, even maybe mature nodes. I know right now, you're capped at 14-nanometer and below for foundry/logic. Is there any commentary you can give on that? And how to think about it, like, let's say, for example, 14 goes to 28, the restriction, or 28 goes to 40. Is there a way to quantify the impact to your sales? And then I have a follow-up. 
Richard Wallace: Yes, I won't speculate what the government will do or not do on that. We have ongoing conversations with them, obviously, and really, we've been supportive of their efforts to try to figure out how to cut off the very leading edge. 
 Beyond that, that's not conversations we've been having with them. But in terms of quantifying, obviously, given that most of the business we have in China is legacy, that would obviously impact our ability to support them in legacy. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Rick. And then as a follow-up, based on the numbers, it looks like you're going to outperform WFE again this year, and you do this last couple of years. The last couple of years, it is more -- some of your peers were supply chain constrained while you were not. And this year, obviously, there's a lot of technology buys. 
 I'm just wondering, as we head into next year or the next couple of years, as WFE starts rebounding, is there a risk that some of the fabs already bought process control equipment, that you could actually underperform WFE? 
Richard Wallace: Well, so I would say that we were supply-constrained, but for a different reason. We couldn't -- we continue to struggle with the demand that we've had for optical. And as I mentioned to a prior question, we continue to see demand for that. So it's true that we managed our supply chain, but we still had gaps. 
 It wasn't like we got hit with things that we didn't expect. We just couldn't ramp as much as some of our customers wanted. The process control intensity has gone up. I mean 1 thing that we clearly forecasted and we're seeing play out now is as EUV gets adopted in more nodes and on more layers and advanced architectures happen, there's a greater need for process control and that's really what we're experiencing. 
 So when we talked about in the Analyst Day and what we're seeing play out, is increased need for process control across all technologies and we feel good about how that looks as we go forward and some of the -- we stick to the forecast we had for our Analyst Day for 2026. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: Congrats on the good results. A few of your peers have talked about fab readiness being impacting their shipment this year, especially for EUV tools. Is that something that you already kind of factored in your WFE outlook you gave a quarter ago, when you also said foundry/logic would be down 10%, which you reiterate today? Or are there some other offsets that you would point out that kind of offset that? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. It's -- it's a good question. And it's something that we had already factored in to our plans as we looked out. What you're seeing is the adjustments to some of the ramp plans. And so while there's still some shipments going into some of these facilities, fewer tools. 
 But it's something that we had already made adjustments for. I think it tends to -- usually, shorter lead time, tools feel it first and then it gets progressively -- eventually, those delays filter into everybody, but it does take some time. So we feel very good about the forecast we provided here in terms of our expectations over the next couple of quarters. 
Sidney Ho: Okay. Great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, speaking of China, I know the revenue is now back to the 30% level. You talked about some of the shipments that came in a little earlier. But I want to ask a little bit different angle. It's clear that there is a big push for self-sufficiency in China, but certain tool sets are harder to replace than others. Can you give us maybe a little bit of color on the competitive dynamics there, that some of your process control clients could be satisfied by domestic companies? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, our market share continues to be strong. I mean we started focusing on legacy market opportunities several years ago. In fact, restarted some older product lines, and they continue to be the most competitive, really, at all price points in terms of -- so we feel while there is more competition at trailing edge, we're very well positioned to be able to win. 
 And a lot of customers have a lot of confidence around the world in our capabilities. So we feel good about our ability to compete against any competitors that are out there. We've been competing with people for a long time in terms of capabilities. So this is not unique, that we would have competition in China. 
Bren Higgins: And you have to remember, our competitive offerings in China or in any other region are really based on the portfolio of products that we can offer. So we can -- we can offer lots of solutions to our customers. To Rick's point, some of our older generation tools, which we've restarted, but even deconfigured versions of more recent tools. 
 And then we allow our customers to manage across their requirements, either for economic or more advanced tools, more capabilities. So our go-to-market in terms of the portfolio benefits us in that region as much as it does anywhere else. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. 
Brian Chin: I guess understanding again that memory investment in general is reduced, and it sounds like the China memory shipment might have hit there in the June quarter, but if I were to assume that some of your DRAM activity in coming quarters will be more geared toward DDR5 and applications for high-performance, high-density DRAM for data center and AI applications, are you noticing or anticipating a higher level of process control intensity for that kind of spend? 
Bren Higgins: Well look, for more advanced -- for more advanced DRAM, particularly with the introduction of EUV, it's driven higher intensity levels, and there's the infrastructure to support the introduction of that, particularly around reticle quality and reticle fidelity. That's been a driver of process control intensity for us over the last couple of years. And so I would expect that, that we'll continue to see it. 
 I'm not expecting to see an uptick in business from memory customers. There will be some additional business from the Chinese DRAM customer in the second half of the year. But we're not really seeing any changes in overall utilization rates in memory, as Rick said earlier, and so I think until our customers start to see a pricing improvement, improve their profitability and cash flow, I don't think we're going to see meaningful investments. Now we will participate in process node development, as we always have. And that's going to be the biggest driver of the contributions from that market. 
Brian Chin: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader follow-up question. Obviously, there's some underutilization of capacity at the leading foundries, more advanced FinFET nodes. And this might just be a cyclical phenomena, but in your conversations with them, do you detect any changes in how they might elect to deploy capital in support of multiple advanced nodes differently? 
Richard Wallace: Well, I mean they've slowed down. I mean for sure, we've seen and heard the reports on forecast for their investment in WFE going down. So I think that's been the main one. What the leading indicators that we are looking at that are encouraging, as I mentioned earlier in this call, we've had utilization rates creep back up from what was forecasted just a few months ago. 
 The other thing is we're still seeing a heavy number of design starts. And so of course, it takes a while for those to filter through. But we still anticipate a very large number of designs at the advanced node and so that will portend for a strong business down the road. You can't pick the timing, but I think that the slowdown in terms of their investment is related to the overall business environment, but not the fundamental dynamics. I think that looks pretty good as we get the next few quarters behind us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, can you give the purchase obligation number? I think it was about $12 billion last quarter. I assume it came down a smidge and book-to-bill is still less than 1. And then also, can you tell us how much is sitting outside of 12 months, that number? 
Bren Higgins: So the specific details will come through when we file our K here in another week or so. But it was down about a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So book-to-bill was a little less than 1. We still see some activity in terms of new orders. So the backlog levels are obviously very elevated. So it's come down. It seems like it's been coming down right around that $500 million or so per quarter for the last few quarters, but still close to $11.5 billion overall. And the beyond 12 months is between 40% and 50% of it, which we deliver beyond the 12-month window. 
Timothy Arcuri: Cool. And then, Bren, just for the top guide for December, it sounds like process control system shipments are pretty flat. It looks like maybe EPC should be up a smidge because you had said before that EPC would be about -- down about 20% for the year. So is that right? And I guess part of that was that you had said last call that maybe the process control shipments in December depended on a couple of projects. So sort of what's the -- what are the puts and takes on process control shipments in December? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I don't want to get specific on guiding December. But certainly, consistent with the prepared remarks, we see a stabilizing rate moving forward. And obviously, that's plus or minus, given the integers of some of our ASPs, that can be plus or minus $20 million or $30 million generally overall across the businesses. 
 And of course, we drive the business to meet the targets we have overall and not necessarily trying to deliver to certain numbers across each of the segments. That being said, Services continues to grow and will grow a little bit each quarter, just like it generally always has, as the installed base continues to grow over time, and so we see growth in Services. 
 EPC could potentially be a little bit volatile. So I -- I'd like to be optimistic. We'll see it pick up from current levels as we get closer to the end of the year, but not modeling it today. I'd like to see -- it's a good indicator given its short lead time, it's more capacity-centric, it's closer to consumer. So it's a decent indicator on consumer markets when we see it recover, because it weakened earlier, and so it should recover sooner perhaps than the Semi PC part of it. 
 And then so Semi PC I think will generally be somewhat consistent with the June quarter result as it flows through into September, which is, again, back to a point of relatively flat guidance quarter-on-quarter. 
 Yes, there are some projects at the end of the year, we'll see how those play out. Could cause the numbers to skew a bit in terms of deliveries into December. And so we'll just have to see how that goes as we work closely with those customers. And so depending on that, that could cause potentially maybe the number to be a little bit higher. But if you just think about it over a couple of quarter time frame, we're -- the choice of the word stabilizing was an important one because that's generally how we see the business overall here over the next couple of quarters. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Maybe as a follow-up to Tim's question, your prior view was for process control to be down roughly kind of mid-teens, right, relative to WFE, which was down 20%. Now off of the better June quarter results and if I flatline stabilize that process control for the remainder of the calendar year after the June quarter, it looks like your process control franchise is actually going to be down only 10% to 12% for the full year. So even better outperformance versus WFE. 
 You mentioned mask inspection, bare wafer, strong dynamics. Like what other product segments are driving the better implied outlook for process control? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Yes, your math is consistent. So yes, that's how it will play out, assuming the December quarter comes through the way we expect today. We talked about bare wafer obviously being a strong driver, optical inspection. Reticle inspection is also a business that isn't declining as much as the overall market. 
 So we've seen strength in those areas. So it's mostly there. Look, given the percent of investment that's happening in logic and foundry, obviously, the process control intensity there is higher than it is in memory. So that tends to provide a nice tailwind in terms of the dynamics within WFE playing towards KLA. And so obviously, the products we talked about are big drivers. But overall, it's good in terms of the percent spend on our products as a percent of the total. 
Harlan Sur: I appreciate that. Is that advanced packaging demand is kicking off quite strongly, right, driven by all these accelerated compute workloads like AI, right? You have HBM, CoWoS packaging, multichip stack-die configuration. TSMC, Intel, all the memory guys, the old stacks, right, you guys supplying to all of them. Are you seeing the demand pick up for your solutions for accelerated compute applications? And is the advanced packaging segment growing this year for the team? Or is that sort of AI accelerated compute demand being somewhat offset by some of the more consumer-focused end markets? 
Richard Wallace: Harlan, yes, good observation. And we have seen an increase -- there haven't been a ton of bright spots with our customers, but that's one, and that has happened fairly recently. We've seen an uptick. It's a small -- relatively small number as a percent. It's got up quite a bit, but off of a small number. 
 So absolutely, we've seen it and we see that directly tie to some accelerated orders for some work that we've done, as you know, with EPC and combining some of the products we have, Semi Process Control and EPC, we absolutely have seen that. So we're seeing an uptick in that. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, you had the overall packaging market down, what, 15% to 20% or so. But if we look at our packaging business within the company, it's pretty flattish year-to-year. Rick talked about some of the recent upside we're seeing related to some of the AI drivers that are occurring right now. So it's a good and evolving story moving forward as more complexity moves into the package across process but also process control. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. 
Atif Malik: I have a question on leading-edge logic investments. At SEMICON West a couple of weeks ago, when you spoke to suppliers, there were expectations that the leading-edge spending could be up less than mature nodes into next year. 
 And I assume process control intensity is higher on leading versus mature nodes. So my question to you is, are there any major product cycles or e-beam or X-ray or major contribution from areas like auto, which could help perhaps offset your exposure to leading-edge investments next year? 
Richard Wallace: Sure. I think that for KLA, the 1 thing you have to keep in mind is we're still supply limited on some of our most critical process control products that apply to the leading edge, such as optical and even some of the reticle products. We just cannot -- we still cannot meet demand. So I think we have a natural governor in there in terms of being able to keep that business sustained over the next several quarters based on even the current booking environment. 
 So I think that's 1 factor. And then the other is we still see, especially with the new architectures that are being out there and people moving to the next-generation transistor architectures, a lot of demand for the leading edge in the R&D phase. So we feel pretty good about how we're positioned for that, less so than one who is primarily focused on capacity would be. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you very much, Chelsea, and I wanted to thank everyone again for their interest and their time. We know it's a very busy earnings season. It's also a very busy day. This was a later call in order to try to accommodate as much as we could. So we look forward to speaking to all of you in the weeks ahead. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chelsea for any final remarks. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-04-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the March 2023 quarter and our June quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market closed. All materials can be found on our IR website.
 Today's discussion is being presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever we make full year references, they are for calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and linked to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
 Our commentary is subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and our outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. Let's start with a summary of KLA's performance in the quarter, along with a few highlights. Further color and detail on my comments and the semiconductor demand environment can be found in our shareholder letter released earlier today. KLA's March quarter results again demonstrate the company's consistency in delivering on long-term strategic objectives and financial targets.
 Specifically, revenue of $2.43 billion was above the midpoint of the guidance range. This represented 6% growth on a year-over-year basis, although down 18% sequentially. GAAP EPS was $5.03 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.49, with each finishing above the midpoint of their respective guidance ranges. From a customer perspective, demand in the quarter was slightly ahead of expectations. Near-term headwinds related to the global macro economy and supply chain remain, but we also see positive outsets emerging as automotive demand and other markets served by legacy nodes remain strong.
 Additionally, the silicon wafer industry continues to invest to support long-term wafer demand growth. Our customers are adjusting capacity plans across both foundry/logic and memory due to changing demand expectations. However, we see R&D investments remain a top priority. This is important for KLA as our products are consistently relied upon during the R&D process as well as the early ramp phase and faster time yield is critical. We had a number of additional business highlights in the quarter.
 Gartner recently released their latest industry market share analysis and process control is the fastest-growing WFE market in 2022, growing 30% in the year to $13.5 billion. Within process control, KLA increased market leadership in most segments, resulting in an overall market share gain of approximately 300 basis points in 2022 to over 57% greater than 4x our nearest competitor. KLA's sustained market leadership is underpinned by our innovation and commitment to high levels of R&D investment. 
 Additionally, the successful execution of KLA's strategies for market diversification were demonstrated by the rapid growth in KLA's automotive-focused businesses. Automotive semiconductor demand is growing in applications where 0-defect mentality is required to achieve superior standards of quality and reliability. KLA has been working with the entire automotive ecosystem to standardize our in-line defect screening methodology called I-PAT to augment existing reliability test efforts.
 As electrification proliferates, the industry is facing an additional opportunity with the integration of -- introduction of new compound semiconductor materials, such as silicon carbide that offer a significant improvement in power efficiency over silicon. In this category, KLA's revenue has grown 2.5x since 2019, approaching $700 million in annual revenue in calendar 2022 and including 5x growth in silicon carbide-related businesses, which account for almost half of total automotive sales. 
 We expect this growth to continue in calendar 2023. In Services, our business grew to $529 million in the quarter, up 8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. KLA Service strength was driven by our growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, expanding service opportunities and legacy nodes and emerging long-term opportunities in acquired businesses. 
 And finally, the March quarter was another excellent period from a cash flow and capital returns perspective, Quarterly free cash flow was $926 million, which drove the latest 12-month free cash flow up 20% to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months was $5.11 billion or 160% of free cash flow. Dividends and share repurchases in the March quarter were $659 million, composed of $478 million in share repurchases and $181 million in dividends.
 Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace continue to prove the resiliency of the KLA operating model and the dedication of our global teams. I will now hand the call over to Bren to go through our financial highlights. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered on our quarter guidance and commitments, demonstrating consistent execution in a challenging marketplace. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading gross and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful. 
 Quarterly revenue was $2.43 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.2 billion to $2.5 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.49, above the midpoint of the guided range of $4.52 to $5.92. GAAP diluted EPS was $5.03. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.8% at the lower end of the guidance range. While volume and product mix were stronger than expected, persistent end market weakness continues to effect the PCB and display in component inspection businesses to a greater degree than expected and drove incremental inventory reserve requirements.
 [indiscernible] also remains a factor across the company as we adjust our capacity down to reflect the current business environment. These issues combined diluted gross margins by approximately 100 basis points and offset the volume and product mix benefits mentioned earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, below our expectation of $545 million, reflecting the impact of modest headcount reductions implemented in the quarter and prudent cost management across the company.
 Total operating expenses comprised $322 million in R&D and $212 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.8%. Other income and expense net was $60 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.52. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $761 million. GAAP net income was $698 million. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion, and free cash flow was $926 million.
 As a result, free cash flow conversion was 122%, and free cash flow margin was 38%. The company had approximately 139 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. 
 Switching to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, including $4.4 billion in share repurchases and $711 million in dividends paid, the total capital returns amounting to 160% of free cash flow.
 Turning to our outlook now. We continue to estimate WFE to decline approximately 20% to $75 million in calendar '23 from approximately $95 million in '22. Our customers' capacity planning remains fluid and indications of end market improvement have limited visibility today. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear, we do see overall demand stabilizing around current business levels for our semiconductor process control systems business.
 We expect this demand profile to continue through the second half of the calendar year. In particular, we are seeing higher than initially expected investment from legacy customers globally, including in China. We have also received clarification from the U.S. government on the export rules issued last October and can now resume some shipments that we had previously excluded. Furthermore, we see additional wafer and reticle infrastructure spending worldwide.
 Our WFE estimate reflects our current top-down estimate of industry demand as follows: in memory, we expect WFE investments to decline by 35% to 40% as memory customers continue to respond to lower consumer demand by adjusting production to bring device supply in light of demand. We expect foundry/logic to decline by about 10% overall with legacy investment declining less than the segment overall due principally to automotive and continued demand for legacy design nodes in China.
 Our June quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $2.25 billion, plus or minus $125 million; Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 77%, and Memory is expected to be around 23% of semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND approximately 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 60.75%, plus or minus 1 percentage point, due primarily to the expected product and segment mix.
 Given the view of a stabilizing demand environment for the remainder of the year, non-GAAP gross margin should remain in this range with the expectation of gross margins to be between 60% and 61% for calendar '23 with product mix being the largest factor in quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage costs carefully. The June quarter always represents the first full quarter of our annual salary adjustments.
 As a result, operating expenses will tick up slightly to approximately $540 million. We continue to see operating expenses trending down for the remainder of calendar '23, exiting the calendar year in the $530 million to $535 million range. Other model assumptions for the June quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $58 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.47, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.83, plus or minus $0.60.
 EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 137.5 million shares. In conclusion, after 3 years of strong industry growth, our view of total WFE demand remains unchanged at down approximately 20% in calendar '23. Against this backdrop, KLA is well positioned to continue to outperform the industry, building on the increased market relevancy delivered in calendar '22.
 Looking ahead, we remain confident of the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are intact. Broadening semiconductor demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors play in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain catalysts for growth. Technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors and our industry have a lowering cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets.
 For KLA, while the global economy and semiconductor industry faced headwinds in 2023, we are well positioned to deliver strong financial performance driven by the relative strength of our Semi PC and SPTS businesses and continued growth in Services. We will continue to focus on innovation as we execute our portfolio strategy to support our customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans.
 With the KLA operating model guiding our execution, we will execute our strategic objectives and drive outperformance. These objectives drive our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services portfolio. They are also the foundation that sustains our technology leadership and competitive differentiation. This has enabled us to achieve industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and deliver consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Chelsea, can you please provide the instructions for Q&A, and then begin the Q&A? 
Operator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: And great to see you had another year of strong share gains from the team last year. You reiterated your full year WFE outlook at down 20%. You also talked about your process control business remaining stable at the June quarter levels through the remainder of this year. I'm wondering if the stable outlook also reflects the stabilization of cancellation and pushout activity from what I assume has been a pretty volatile bookings environment over the past 6 months? 
Bren Higgins: Harlan, thanks for the compliment. On -- overall, from a bookings point of view, look, the customers are still moving things around in terms of backlog and slotting. There was some scrubbing in the quarter of some adjustments, fairly minor, in our overall backlog in our RPO number, which you'll see, which is the remaining performance obligations, you'll see in our 10-Q filing that we'll do in the next day or so, came down about $600 million.
 So that implies that the book-to-bill was a little bit less than 1, and then there were some adjustments overall. But some timidity in scheduling, but just over the prepared remarks, we do see a stabilization around these levels as we look out over the next few quarters. 
Harlan Sur: Perfect. And then on your EPC franchise, this -- it's driven pretty strong growth, right, 10% to 11% CAGR over the past 3 years, that's including Services. It even grew 7% last year, right, in a slower consumer environment. Coming into this year, though, you guys are already driving an EPC systems profile of down about 20% year-over-year. Do you still anticipate the EPC business to grow this to outperform WFE growth? And sort of at a high level, how are you thinking about EPC profile second half versus first half? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. It's a great question, Harlan. And certainly, over the last few months, we've seen a shift in our expectations for that business. It tends to be short lead time and very consumer sensitive, if you will. And so as the consumer markets have yet to really recover, we were expecting to see a bounce back in the second half. And while I expect the second half to be a little bit stronger than the first half -- and this is really regarding the PCB business, flat panel business and the ICOS component inspection business because SPTS has a different profile, I'll talk about that in a second.
 But in those businesses, we expect it to increase and improve modestly into the second half, but that we're likely to -- in that segment that will -- it will be a decline year-over-year that's more than what we expect out of the WFE-centric businesses. SPTS on the other hand, has had a nice growth trajectory. We had a strong year last year and would expect to see that business be somewhere flat, maybe modestly up this year.
 It is very exposed to the automotive market, specifically around power semiconductors and some of the new specialty substrates. And so there are opportunities for us there. We're pretty pleased with how we're -- how that business is progressing here despite the weakness overall in WFE. 
Operator: Our next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, surprised you haven't changed your foundry WFE outlook for 2023 at all. Many of your peers discussed modest adjustments there. So would love to hear your thoughts as to what's offsetting that? And as part of that, can you speak to the lead times for optical inspection, which I still think are well beyond 12 months? So is that the kind of the key to the story for KLA where you're finding this sustainable level at the June level in the second half? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, C.J., in the overall business, we're seeing more strength than we had expected originally in the legacy parts of the market, so greater than 28-nanometer, and that's a global statement. China is also stronger in terms of expectations there from a legacy point of view. So while we've seen some adjustments in the leading-edge expectations, we've seen some strengthening overall legacy. So obviously, there are some error bars around these percentages as we look out from the March quarter. But that's really what's driving our outlook here. 
Christopher Muse: Great. And then maybe just to follow up on the legacy part. You talked about native China being 25% of process control. How much of that is silicon wafer versus just traditional front-end equipment? 
Bren Higgins: So over the course of the -- if we just take an annual perspective and think about it, I would say the silicon wafer part is probably -- and this is an estimate, probably about 20% to 25% of it. So the other thing [indiscernible] on optical inspection. You asked about lead times of our -- on optical inspection. I'm sorry, I left that out of your -- the first part of your question. So lead times are -- on optical inspection are still pretty long.
 There hasn't really been a change there as we are adding new capacity to support demand. Customers are still investing in their technology road maps, and that product is pretty essential to that. And so we continue to see an environment where demand is outpacing supply. So in and down, WFE market, I expect the high-end optical inspection to grow this year given those dynamics. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. 
Vivek Arya: I'm curious what's giving you the confidence that sales have bottomed when many of your memory customers still appear to have a lot of inventory and are unclear when the utilization will pick up. So specifically, how is your visibility to the memory demand for the back half of this calendar year? Do you think it will be about this level, it'll be lower, above this level?
 Because I noticed that in June, the implied memory sales seem to be picking up, albeit of small numbers. So just any comments on how you're thinking about memory demand recovery from here as it pertains to what you think about utilization at your key memory customers. 
Bren Higgins: Sure. It's a good question. If you look at the March quarter, it was pretty low, right, at 14%. So -- and I look back -- and you go back in any of our recent history hasn't been that low really ever. So -- and even as you see it progress through the year into the guidance, sort of the 23% that we talked about in June and -- even as it sort of stays in that range as you move through the second half of the -- for the year, it's still -- while second half might be a little bit stronger than the first half, given how low the first half was, it's still pretty low overall in terms of our forecast and expectations.
 And there's some wildcards around how customers ultimately spend. We tend to be more technology-centric, and so there's still a road map investments that's happening that we're participating in. There's also some opportunities related to the clarification of some of the export controls and what that means in terms of some incremental opportunities to support some of the older generation memory devices in China. And so that clarification that we received from the government will enable the second half shipments. And so that's in our outlook as well. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Just to add to that, if you look at the business that we have, it's more tied to capacity and memory, that's not really showing up. What's showing up, as Bren said, is more on technology. So even as those customers or not -- or even have a low utilization, not adding capacity, they are very motivated to continue to work on technology development that plays to -- as Bren said, it's a relatively small number, but there's some stability in that. 
Vivek Arya: Got it. And from my follow-up, I realize it's early, but I thought that given that you have long lead times and you are engaged in the technology side with many customers, you probably have a decent view of how the calendar '24 might look like. So I'm not asking for numerical guidance, but what's your gut right now that is WFE likely to grow next year? Is it supposed to be flat or down? Like what could be, just the kind of qualitative puts and takes as we start thinking about WFE next year? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Obviously, just to start off with the obvious, we don't have a lot of visibility into next year. But we can tell you about the conversations we're having with customers, which have to do a lot with their view that things are kind of stabilizing at this level for the most part. And in some cases, it's because things are down quite a bit, but there's a lot of activity still in, for example, advanced logic nodes or advanced foundry nodes, of design starts and a lot of work going on there. 
 And we're still having conversations about supporting projects that are due to happen at the end of this year or early into next year. So if you had to pin us down on it, I think we're kind of -- at these kind of levels, plus or minus, for a while. And hopeful that during calendar '24, we'll see some recovery, but it's obviously too soon to know that. But I think that that's the general way we're thinking about it going forward. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: The first one, Rick or Bren, you spoke about resuming some shipments to China. Can you quantify in terms of millions of dollars, how much that you're going to expect to recoup in the second half? And is that baked into your view that revenue will stay around these levels into the calendar second half? And along the same path, this China shipment assumption is tied to kind of lagging as memory, and I'm kind of curious, what exactly you mean by lagging as memory because I thought memory is always at leading edge. And then I have a follow-up. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Krish, so we expect to be somewhere greater than $200 million in terms of the opportunity in the second half. And we're working with the customer to make sure that we have what we need to be able to support that activity. But that's how we're sizing it right now overall. So look, I think on the technology question is that not everyone is at the leading edge. And so there's activity that's happening in legacy markets, and there's some market opportunities out there from an end market point of view to support some of these investments. So that's what's driving that investment. And like I said, we see it somewhere in that couple of hundred million range. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up, should we still expect your service revenues to grow this year? And how to think about the service between the Semi and the EPC portion? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, this is Rick. So yes, we should see growth in Service. And I think this is one of the differentiators for KLA is how our Service behaves and slow down. We're seeing a lot of interest from our customers to keep that capability. So even when capacity might go off, what customers want to focus on is yield and making sure that they're continuing to develop new technology. 
 And so that plays to our strength. Obviously, we've talked about some of the slowdown we've seen in EPC. So this is much more about Semi process control. But yes, we're still modeling the growth that we've talked about in the past for Service, and that's a big part of our value that we provide for our customers. So we feel good about where we are there. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. And for the Semi PC part of the business, given the reduction or the softening in the industry environment, some [indiscernible] capacity, the dynamics around the memory business that people have already asked about, I wouldn't expect Service to grow in line with the long-run target of 12% to 14%. As we said last quarter, we see it somewhere in the mid- to high single-digit growth rate this year, obviously some headwinds from the export controls as a factor in that. 
 But still growth, to Rick's point. And on the EPC side, the EPC side, probably flat, maybe modestly up a little bit. Service business behaves a little bit differently. There are some long-term opportunities for us to try to drive that business over time given our global footprint. That's obviously a longer-term play. But the Service business generally is not declining, but not growing a lot this year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Just a first of clarification. For the clarification on export restrictions that you received, that $200 million you're thinking about for the second half of this year, did that reenter your backlog or RPO this quarter? 
Bren Higgins: Never came out. Because it was a clarification issue, so we were -- as I've said in prior quarters, until we had certainty, we weren't going to scrub out anything out of our backlog. In this case, we required a clarification. And so until we have certainty, we left things in. So no change from that point of view. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Got it. And then as a follow-up, on the gross margin side, how should we think about inventory reserves for the rest of this year? And then can you just remind us how do we think about the timing of those reversals? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think the last couple of quarters, we've had some meaningful adjustments from what we were driving the company to the current demand levels. And if you recall back in '21 and '22 given the supply chain shortages that were out there, we were making fairly significant commitments in our supply chain that in a lot of ways, drove the performance that we saw in '21 and '22 from a growth point of view, and particularly from a relative growth point of view. 
 So as we've had to adjust down to different demand levels at a fairly quick pace, it has driven some incremental reserves related to just excess supply. So what I would expect, well, in this happening is, over time, as we see a meaningful resumption in demand given the extendibility and lifetime of our platforms, the strength of our Service business will ultimately consume those parts.
 It's not like you throw the parts away. It's just you have more than you need for the demand window in terms of how you see the assessment. So on a go-forward basis, I expect it to normalize and not be an issue for us. EPC was a bit of a surprise, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks this quarter. And that was really driven by just this weakening overall expectation into the second half that we previously thought we'd see stronger demand.
 But we think that we've adjusted now and so the impact moving forward, assuming the outlook that we provided normalizes and isn't an incremental factor one way or the other. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. 
Atif Malik: I have 2 questions on China. First, is the number of customers you're engaged domestically in China on trailing edge higher this year versus last year or year before? 
Richard Wallace: I wouldn't say higher, no. But there's a lot of projects. 
Bren Higgins: I mean, I -- but yes, Rick's right. I wouldn't say higher. 
Atif Malik: Okay. And then on multinational companies in China, Rick, in your discussions with these companies, how are they looking at their future capacity expansions given that the license period for the export restrictions is coming due in September, October? I mean, how are they looking strategically on investments in China? 
Bren Higgins: Well, it's hard enough for us to get the clarification. I think for them, that's -- they're working on the same thing as getting clarification on exactly what they'll be able to do. So I think there -- they have conversations with us, but frankly, the discussions they're having that matter the most to them are not with us. We're able to support them no matter which way that goes. But I think that's something they're all working through. And there's some stuff in the press about it, but you can imagine that there's a fair amount of anxiousness around that. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I had 2. So first, I'm just trying to tie your process control systems commentary to WFE. And it sounds like Orbotech systems -- I mean, you're not exclusively saying this in June, but it sounds kind of like they're pretty flattish. So Process Control Systems have to be about [ $1,550 million ], down maybe $175 million from March. And then in the shareholder letter, you're saying that it's going to sort of remain flat into the back half of the year at that level.
 So if I just take the [ $1,720 million ] you did in March and then I take the [ $1,550 million ] in June and I kind of flatline that, and I used $75 billion this year in WFE, that implies you're like 8.5% this year for WFE share, that's -- I mean, that's a record high. So I guess the question is, is there something structural going on that you think there's staying power to where your WFE share could stay that high? Usually, I think, 6% in the trough and 8% in the peak, but you're sort of like 8.5%? Or maybe is it that your $75 billion numbers too low? 
Bren Higgins: Tim, I'm not -- we do this every quarter. I'm not going to guide the individual segments, but your math is reasonable. And again, with our comments around stabilized, it's plus or minus relative to the current business levels. But that's how we see things moving forward now. In terms of your -- and we talked about this a little bit over the last number of months is that we felt pretty confident about our ability to maintain our share of WFE that there were drivers in terms of as we look at '23 and you see customers continuing to invest in their road maps. 
 Particular product lines that are inflecting some of the fastest-growing product lines and overall WFE would be factors for growth for us. Our exposure to the bare silicon or the silicon wafer industry is a driver of WFE that we're exposed to that others aren't. The infrastructure investment that's happening in China from a wafer and reticle point of view is also an inflection point. I think what's exposed to export controls overall as a percent of the total for us is a little bit lower than some of the other peers.
 And then finally, we're seeing a very strong share performance overall, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. So when you add all that up -- and share is also important because in a downturn when budgets are limited, customers tend to buy best of breed, and that tends to play to KLA's favor as well. So when you add all that up, as I've been saying for a number of months, I feel pretty confident that despite all the adjustments out there that folks were making in deferred revenue and partial shipments and all those kinds of dynamics that we're adding some confusion overall that we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to maintain our share of the overall market. 
 Process control intensity stronger in a foundry/logic environment and certainly more of the WFE spend is there. And so that's always a factor for us in any downturn. And why -- typically in down WFE years, KLA has, I think we might go back even decades, we've always outperformed the market in down years. So I think there's a number of factors that's contributing to it. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Just to build on it, Tim. I think, as Bren mentioned, process control intensity is up some, but I think the share story is maybe even more significant. And then where it's really shown up has been optical inspection. And a lot of that is around relevancy of our optical inspection to some of the new nodes that people are dealing with. And it took a while for some of our customers to really fully appreciate the capability of both the Gen 4 and Gen 5 platforms. 
 And those 2 -- I mean, frankly, we're still constrained, we're capacity constrained on those. Those would grow more if we had more capacity. And the reason for that is, I think we are demonstrating to our customers value. And when we thought originally, it'd be mostly logic and foundry, even there, we're seeing some strength, albeit memory is very low. But we're seeing adoption of advanced inspection. So I think that's another way to look at it. If you look at the performance last year overall for process control, I don't think it was an accident, it's relevancy of our solutions. 
Timothy Arcuri: And then I guess I had a question also on WFE. And some people are trying to get at this, I think. But -- so WFE is still sort of flat in the $75 billion range. I think, Bren, you said that there's $200 million for you that can shift that sort of an add-back of stuff that was banned in the past. So if you're less than 10% of WFE, that's probably like a few billion dollar add back from just from China there, and then there's all this lagging edge stuff happening in China. 
 So is it that the lagging edge kind of stuff -- like it's not helping this year? It's more helping next year? I guess I'm a little surprised that the $75 billion number is not higher just given the massive increase in bookings that we're seeing from lagging edge in China? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. We're a little -- Tim, we're in April. It's an estimate, an approximation at plus or minus around 77 -- or $75 billion is a way to think about it at this point. So we don't put a lot of extra effort. We focus a lot on running our own business and executing this one. We just try to do what we can to do an assessment of the overall market, and we'll share that with you. But there are a lot of moving parts, right?
 We'll get some clarity in terms of ultimately what that impact is. I sized it. Could it be more, could be less? Perhaps, but just overall -- and I think the other factor that could impact this year is just some of the construction dynamics where facilities are being built. And when customers actually receive tools, if you have delays in construction schedules that could affect what shows up when, and there's a number of greenfield projects that are out there. So a lot of moving parts in it, but we're comfortable with the plus or minus $75 billion, and we'll firm it up as we go here. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: I want to follow up with the previous question about -- you talked about the stabilizing demand and maybe a similar profile for the rest of the year. Are you expecting your revenue for the back half of the year to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of that $200 million of recoup revenue? Or are there other factors to consider whether it's on the service business on the EPC side of things? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Sidney, we just did $2.432 billion, right, in -- or $2.433 billion in the March quarter. And so the commentary was focused on current business levels at $2.25 billion. So it might put a little bit of pressure on the second half from a half-to-half point of view. But we are talking about kind of low single digit, low to mid-single digit given that guidance. 
 And again, we're not guiding the second half. We're just giving a view of this stabilization here. So it's possible, right? It will be close. But I think just given the strength of the March quarter, that it would -- if you end up with roughly the same numbers in the second half, you might be half to half down modestly. 
Sidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is one of your largest customers in Taiwan talked about higher levels of tool reuse between the 5 nanometers and 3 nanometers. How is this factored into your second half outlook and maybe even the longer-term outlook? And do you think that's anything incremental to what the industry's current level of capacity is used between those? 
Richard Wallace: It's a good question, Sidney. I think that those are always conversations customers have had in terms of when they look at their utilization. And they look at the differences from node to node. I think it is something that is always being evaluated. They're always trying to optimize the portfolio. The work that we've done in modeling our 2026 plan and the work that we do even looking through the rest of the year and next year, have contemplated all of that. 
 So there's nothing really in there that's new from our perspective about the amount of consumption of process control and process control intensity. It does highlight the need for us to continue to invest in R&D and bring out new capabilities and continue to support our customers. So nothing really new in what we see in those statements. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: I had a follow-up question to Sidney's question. Given the depth and breadth of design start activity you're seeing in the leading edge foundry space. What are your expectations for process control intensity into 2024? Is there a bias potentially to the upside from where you are in 2023? 
Bren Higgins: Well, look, Toshiya, we -- process control intensity has been very strong for the reasons you talked about, if you think about the number of design starts and what that means in terms of our customers managing a number of different designs that test design rules in different ways and then having to deliver yielded wafers in fairly tight market windows. It all drives a higher level of inspection and metrology. 
 You also have different process flows and process points that are expected to. So those are all -- have been drivers for process control. As the design starts at the previous node, it was also a factor. And then new tech, right, new tech with the introduction of more EUV to drive scaling but also more layers here moving forward. So those are all positives for us. Also depending on the mix of the revenue, die size is also a factor. 
 So if you end up with exposure to markets with larger die, you put more risk with the same defect density, so that creates a driver for process control as well. So there are a number of factors. We feel pretty -- if you just back up and look at the overall share of the market as it relates to foundry/logic, we've seen an inflection here, and we think that we can sustain that inflection as we move forward. 
Toshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I think you commented specifically on China as it pertains to your business with wafer suppliers and reticle suppliers as well. But curious on a global basis, how big are those businesses today? And how should we think about sustainability over the next 12 months or so, again, on the wafer side as well as both merchant and captive reticle customers? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Most of the reticle infrastructure -- new infrastructure is being added in China to support legacy activity, and that's probably a driver of an incremental couple of hundred million or so of revenue for us. Overall wafer -- and I'm separating this way because I don't want to double count. But overall, wafer should grow meaningfully this year compared to last year. 
 And it's a pretty sizable business for KLA. So I don't want to -- we haven't broken it out before, but we're an expensive or a big part of the CapEx for wafer suppliers, and we would expect to see that growing this year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: You talked about kind of qualitatively about Services not being down this year, maybe up a little bit this year. Can you talk about the utilization impact on that? And as you see utilizations coming down in both foundry and memory, I guess I would think that has less impact on you than it does for some of the other guys. But can you just talk to how utilization might weigh on that number? 
Bren Higgins: The utilization rates have clearly come down, particularly in the memory space. It seems like they are fairly stable at this point. We don't see them continuing to decline from where they are. So -- and that's why we see the overall revenue because customers are not running the tools to start or in some cases, idling capacity. So you don't have the opportunities -- the Service opportunities we would have in a higher utilization environment. 
 So that's what's driving the overall growth rate down from what a normalized or our trend line expectation is. But we're not seeing it really getting worse at this point, and there are pockets from time to time of improvement. So I think it's -- stabilization is the right word is why we chose to use it, but it feels like that's really what we're seeing today. 
Joseph Moore: That's helpful. And then separately, on China, you guys have talked to the sort of China trailing-edge logic opportunity a couple of different times here. Your sense for whether there's building ahead there -- I mean I would assume you have customers there that have anxiety about future export controls, could they be putting in capacity? I guess maybe a different way of asking the question, do you see utilization that kind of validates the requirement of the spending? Or do you worry that it could be a building ahead of supply? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. It's possible. I mean we don't have great clarity on all of it, but it does seem unlikely given the recent history of when you've lost support of equipment provider, the tools aren't very useful. So I think the expectation is the controls will remain on the leading edge, and they'll be able to continue to develop some of these mature technologies. Remember, there's a very active EV market in China.
 So there's a lot of need for some of that more mature technology as it applies to some of those markets. So it does seem to be based on some real demand around things that are not leading edge, and that's really what we're seeing and have for quite a while in China. So it doesn't feel like it's necessarily that. There are companies that are ramping up. And in that sense, they might not have won the markets that they hope to win yet, but we've kind of factored that into our overall forecasting for China anyway. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. 
Blayne Curtis: I was curious, I mean, you talked about in the outlook, legacy growing faster than leading edge. Just curious if you could give us a perspective where that mix is within foundry/logic today? And maybe a perspective of where it's come from? 
Bren Higgins: Well, so it's declining less. It's not growing. It's really just declining less in terms of the overall outlook. I mean for KLA, if you just thought about what's less than 28 nanometers versus what's above in our mix profile, you have about 60% of our revenue is we'll call it less than 28-nanometer, and so about 40% of it is above. And then normally, it's closer to 75% leading, 25% lagging, so to give you a sense of it being a bigger part of our mix this quarter. And it's broad-based. And certainly, China is a pretty big factor in and all, but you also have a fair amount of revenue growth, the analog guys and supporting some of the automotive markets, sensor investment, some industrial markets and so on. So that's -- there's steady investment in these end markets where semiconductor content is rising, and so you're seeing more investment in those areas that we frankly didn't ship a lot into over the last couple of years given the strength of demand at the leading edge. 
 And our largest customers, given the supply-demand imbalance taking most of the slots. So in some ways, as we've seen the leading edge adjust, and this is a logic and memory statement, we've seen some adjustments in our largest customers over the last 6 months or so and into this year, some of that capacity is getting consumed by folks that wanted earlier slots, and we weren't able to deliver to them. 
Blayne Curtis: And then I wanted to ask you on the inventories on the balance sheet. I think it's a record level -- near record in data as well. So I guess kind of everybody has this phenomena going on. How are you thinking about managing that with the top line kind of flat to down? I'm kind of curious if inventories will still grow and any impact on gross margin as you work it down? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. And I've said this many times, but we're not the company that you look to for asset velocity as it relates to inventory. And there's a reason for that is it starts with the business model the KLA has around driving innovation and differentiation and that drives a fair amount of custom componentry into our systems and very unique supply relationships where our suppliers are trusted partners more than a transactional supply chain. 
 As a result of that, what we optimize for is we optimize for that differentiation. And what we accept is we accept that we're going to need to make commitments. Lead times are long, we're going to take parts when we put orders out to take them. And in the long run, we believe that economically, we're in a pretty good place that given the strength of Service extendibility of the platforms, that we'll consume the parts that we're buying against our volume products. 
 So we've seen it trend up, and it's trending up, I'd expect it to start to flatten out, maybe drift a little bit. But I'm already starting to buy parts for new products that are coming out for things that will have some unique parts for new products that will be coming out over the next 12 to 18 months or so. So I don't expect it to turn very much. That's why even in these very strong upturn environments, we've rarely gotten above -- much above 2x from an inventory term point of view. 
 So we'll continue to manage it, but it's sort of fundamental to our supply chain strategy. And as a result of that, when you're buying parts to support products that are -- they are living for 20 to 30 years, there's a lot of that buy to support that, and we carry it. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. 
Brian Chin: Maybe for Rick, trailing edge clearly is sort of less process control intensive. But I guess to what extent does the immaturity of these production lines, particularly in China, a lot of greenfield situations and also the desire for faster time to market, how do these factors kind of counteract that typical kind of lower intensity for trailing edge? 
Richard Wallace: Well, I think that -- a couple of ways. One is it depends on the applications for the fabs. So if you're an automotive fab, you actually have a different kind of need for process control than you do if you're just a traditional legacy fab. So that's 1 thing. The -- that actually process control intensity can be a little bit higher. And then depending on the scale and the size of the fab on a relative basis, it's harder to have -- you get more efficiency on a large fab.
 And so these fabs tend not to be as mega fabs, and then you actually get a little bit of intensity as a result. They're also looking for solutions that have been proven in the market. And so for us, those are established product lines that we've been supporting for a long time that might not need as much advanced application support. So those are all factors that I think both good for our customers, but also a good business for KLA. 
 So yes, it's not as intensive as a leading-edge fab, but they still have a ways to go to catch up. And there's always value in getting higher yield. And whenever they change process nodes, we see interest in upgrading their process control. 
Brian Chin: Great. Maybe just a quick follow-up. In terms of the percent of memory increasing in the June quarter -- and it looks like also on a dollar basis as well, I think you suggested it's pretty focused towards DRAM. Can you characterize the nature of that uptick? Or is this more of a kind of a classic case of coming off such lows in March that this is really more of a bouncing along a bottom kind of situation? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, I think it's more of the latter. I wouldn't characterize it as anything other than just some investments that some timing of -- I think tool deliveries with our customer base, and it's very technology-centric. So I wouldn't characterize it as given the level of it. It's been a while since it's been this low even with the uptick quarter-to-quarter. It's pretty technology-centered with the exception of -- some of the China opportunities we get early. 
Operator: Our last question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Just 2 follow-ups for me. If I just take your commentary regarding the revenue trend first half and second half of the calendar, it seems to me that the peak to trough decline in revenues in the 25% to 30% range. And I'm not asking you for a guide. But what I wanted to better understand if you did close to $3 billion in December of '22 with a WFE in the $90 billion to $95 billion. Can you go and hit those revenue run rate without WFE -- if not WFE having to go to $90 billion? Does your diversification looking forward, especially with semiconductor material and others, would enable you to hit [ $3 billion ] without having WFE to go to $90 billion plus? And I have a follow-up. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Mehdi, I mean, one of the things -- and this ties back to the rising share of WFE that we've seen over the last couple of years is that we're gaining share of the overall market, so we should be able to do more revenue with lower WFE levels as that sustains. Now there are mix dynamics and other factors that affect it. But given the dynamics that have driven and we believe there's a fair amount of sustainability to it. 
 There are new products that we believe can continue to solve problems for customers. We have exposure to markets that are inflecting and are pretty critical to the scaling road maps out there. So -- and our share, we improved share by almost 300 basis points. And that's a lot in 1 year. We talked a lot about 0.5 point to 1 point a year in terms of our objectives. But we do think that, that is a clear indicator of the differentiation that we have. 
 And if we're able to be successful with some of the new products that are coming and the mix generally stays as we talked about at our Investor Day of 60-ish percent foundry/logic in terms of overall mix of WFE, that there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow our share opportunity. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then just 1 quick follow-up. If any of your customers were to reuse some of the equipment, how should we think about price diagnostic content for that application? 
Bren Higgins: Well, as Rick said earlier, this is nothing new that customers are always looking to optimize their capacity, given what this equipment cost and the amount of investment they're making, they're always looking to do that. And there are certain product types where there are -- there's more opportunity than others. It was easy for customers to reuse capacity when they only had a very limited number of designs and no major technology drivers. 
 But as you look out going forward, given scaling dynamics and increase in EUV layers, I think that there's a technology element that will drive our customers to continue to upgrade their capabilities. But I am sure they will look for opportunities. If in the long run, they believe that there's a sustainable drop in the wafer start requirement to try to relocate that capacity or try to reuse it. 
 You can't move it overnight, right, particularly if you're moving it to a different facility. These tools have to be disassembled, they have to be shipped and reassembled and then calibrated and brought up. So those tend to be longer-term decisions. So structurally, they have to feel pretty good about the longer-term setup for that fab or at that node to move the equipment.
 What they typically do in the short run is they idle capacity if they don't need it for a period of time, but with an expectation that it will come back online. And given the design start environment at 7 and 5, it's really -- there's still a fair amount of designs out there that is just volumes are low. So we'll see how it plays out. But nothing new. And as Rick said, it's modeled in our view of growth in KLA opportunity moving forward. 
Kevin Kessel: And thank you, everyone, for your time today for -- we know it's busy earnings season. I appreciate it. We'll be seeing many of you at some of the upcoming conferences. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Chelsea, so she can provide any final instructions. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-01-26 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. 
 And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Sir, please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and welcome to our earnings call to discuss the results of the December quarter and our March quarter outlook. 
 Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. All materials can be found on our IR website. 
 Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website.
 Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
 Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
 Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook. 
 I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I will summarize KLA's performance in the quarter and summarize calendar 2022. I'll also provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment as well as outline KLA's priorities for 2023. 
 Before we get into details, I want to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who've continued to deliver for customers despite persistent challenges. KLA's results are proof of their commitment. 
 KLA's December quarter have revenue of $2.98 billion, which is above the guidance range, with 27% growth on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS was $6.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.38, with each finishing above the midpoint of the guidance ranges. 
 Calendar 2022 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow. Specifically, revenue increased 28% in 2022 to $10.5 billion, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth, driven by 36% growth in semiconductor process control systems. 
 KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2022 with non-GAAP operating profit up 31% in the year. Non-GAAP incremental operating margin on the revenue growth was 46% for the year. For calendar 2022, free cash flow was up a healthy 18% to a record $3 billion, with free cash flow growth exceeding our 15% long-term target growth rate. 
 Now I'll summarize some specific highlights from the quarter and the year. First, KLA continued to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers. KLA substantially outperformed overall WFE market growth in 2022. Looking ahead, our leadership in critical markets, such as wafer and reticle inspection, are expected to demonstrate resiliency in a year of contraction in overall WFE demand, setting the stage for another year of relative strength for KLA. Second, our Patterning Systems revenue grew 17% sequentially, which is up 69% on a year-over-year basis. 
 Third, KLA delivered record revenue in the 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our specialty semiconductor process segment, demonstrating resiliency and expanding market opportunity. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew 14% year-over-year in the December quarter and was up 15% on a full year basis. Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional period from a capital returns perspective as we completed the $3 billion accelerated share repurchase component of the $6 billion share repurchase authorization announced last June. 
 KLA December quarter and calendar 2022 results and strong relative performance once again highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our consistent strong execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainties and addressing persistent supply chain challenges highlight the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation, and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders. 
 Looking at 2023, we know that this will be a year of industry capacity adjustments as customers fine-tune their CapEx plan to address decreased demand in some segments. However, we recognize that the semiconductor industry continues to be positioned for long-term growth, benefiting from the continued advancement of leading-edge technologies, increasing investment in legacy nodes and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. 
 To address this period of adjustment and maintain our commitment to growth, we're emphasizing 3 main priorities for our teams in navigating 2023. First, we will continue to make sure that we support our customers by delivering on our commitments and continuing our levels of investment in R&D. 
 Second, we'll stabilize our spending levels. To strategically navigate the current environment, our focus will be on stabilizing spending while maintaining R&D investments to drive market leadership. Our expectation is for R&D investment to increase in calendar 2023. 
 Third, we'll emphasize development of our workforce. After a strong hiring pace, we're currently at approximately 15,000 employees worldwide. Optimizing training and developing our workforce will help ensure continued strength for the long term. 
 Now Bren will review our December quarter highlights and our outlook. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thanks. As Rick just detailed, we delivered strong December quarter and calendar '22 results that demonstrated consistent execution by the global KLA team. While supply chain challenges remain and impact on certain products, we continue to demonstrate resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meet customer requirements. 
 Quarterly revenue was $2.98 billion, $184 million above the midpoint of guidance and just above the guided range of $2.65 billion to $2.95 billion. Revenue outperformance in the December quarter was driven primarily by KLA's broadband plasma optical pattern wafer inspection and mask inspection systems, resulting from favorable mitigation of identified supply chain risks as we move through the quarter. 
 Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.38, above the midpoint of the guided range of $6.30 to $7.70. GAAP diluted EPS was also above the midpoint of guidance at $6.89. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61% and just below the guidance range of 61.5% to 63.5% due to the impact of increasing noncash inventory reserves taken in the quarter as we adjusted our factory output expectations and supply chain commitments to the current outlook, which has weakened at an accelerated pace over the past several months. These reserves were primarily taken against high-volume products and are consistent with shifting customer delivery dates and resulting backlog adjustments in the quarter. 
 Given the diversification of end demand across technology nodes, the extendibility of our product platforms and the expectations for growth in our service business, it is likely that we will realize a benefit from releasing these reserves over time when industry growth resumes. We estimate that these adjustments had a roughly 200-basis-point impact on GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin compared to what would have been assessed in a normalized industry environment. This impact was offset somewhat by higher business volume and by a strong product mix realized in the quarter. 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $555 million, slightly above our estimated $550 million for the quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $332 million in R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 42.4%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $1.05 billion. GAAP net income was $979 million. Cash flow from operations was $688 million, and free cash flow was $595 million. Breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. 
 Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $6.1 billion, a reduction of $200 million in the quarter and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.5 billion in share repurchases and $689 million in dividends paid.
 Looking ahead to calendar '23, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY '23 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY '22 due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations. 
 This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market, with DRAM down more than NAND as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect foundry logic to decline less than the overall market with leading-edge investment declining less than legacy. 
 KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition are focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of the business environment. While capacity plans could change, technology roadmap investment tends to be more resilient and aligns with KLA's highest value product offerings, where we continue to have supply chain constraints inhibiting our ability to add the additional volumes to meet current demand. This demand adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with roadmap requirements. 
 In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements; maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product roadmaps and KLA's market leadership; and align our operating structure with top line expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis while delivering strong relative financial performance.
 Our March quarter guidance is as follows. Revenue of $2.35 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 85%, and memory is expected to be around 15% of semi PC systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 71% of the segment mix and NAND 29%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product and segment mix and lower volumes dilute gross margins versus the '22 baseline in the quarter. Based on current market demand assessments, we do not expect incremental inventory reserve requirements to be a factor in the quarter. 
 For calendar '23, based on our current industry outlook and the impact on overall volume, segment contribution and product mix within the semiconductor process control group, we are modeling gross margins to be greater than 60% with variability quarter-to-quarter attributable to product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses will decline in the March quarter to approximately $545 million.
 For calendar '23, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology, head count and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives while managing the business against the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, we expect quarterly operating expense levels to decline as we move through the balance of the year.
 Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $62 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Based on our current assessment of geographic revenue and profit expectations, you should continue to use 13.5% as the tax finding rate for calendar '23. 
 Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.06 to $5.46 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.52 to $5.92. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 139 million shares. 
 In conclusion, though calendar 2023 will be a year of contraction after 3 strong years of growth, we remain confident that the secular trends outlined in our Investor Day last June are driving long-term semiconductor industry demand, and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand across multiple production nodes, increasingly strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy, a robust design environment at the leading edge and growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends. 
 These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. 
 For KLA, we have a strong historical track record of delivering relative outperformance across industry cycles. To be competitive over the long run, our customers must continue to invest in product roadmaps irrespective of market conditions. Furthermore, KLA services has continued to grow consistently over multiple decades due to the critical nature of KLA products to improving yield learning and driving fab productivity. Our operational execution, coupled with the power of our portfolio strategy, positions us to continue to deliver sustainable relative performance over the next several years.
 We will continue to maintain our R&D investment and our product development roadmaps to enable market share expansion, support customers' technology roadmaps and multiyear fab investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us well as we execute our strategic objectives. 
 These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and services offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, consistent industry-leading financial performance and growing capital returns to shareholders. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? 
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please give instructions to queue for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess, first question, you talked about expectations to outperform WFE again here in calendar '23. So curious, can you kind of walk through, is that a comment on total revenues? Or just process control? And within that, how should we be thinking about the benefit from backlog/deferred revenues, particularly into the March quarter? Trying to make sure I calculate that right in my model. 
Bren Higgins: C.J., so I'll start, and we'll let Rick chime in if there's more. But I think there are a few factors as you think about KLA's performance generally as we're looking at this year. Obviously, we had a very strong 2022 from a relative point of view. And when we talk about that, we're really talking about the compares against WFE, right? Because the other industries we're in, it's less clear. But given the Semi PC compared to WFE, if you look back historically, we've always done well in down years for WFE because our customers across all our segments pull back on capacity but continue to invest in technology and their technology roadmap. So that's always a positive factor for us. 
 We also see PC intensity moving up because it -- where you generally see more cycling is in memory. And so given the relative PC intensity in logic and foundry, that tends to be something that's good for us as well. Relative to EUV and the dynamics around EUV, radical EUV, our optical pattern inspection business are inflecting. So that gives us incremental, I think, support in terms of growth as we expect both those businesses to be better performers relative to the overall industry, and they're big parts of KLA. 
 China impacts another factor, right? I think if you look at some of the peer companies and some of the export control dynamics as a percent of the total, I think they're impacting some of our peers, perhaps at a little greater degree than KLA. So I think for all those factors, we feel pretty good about our position as we think about just our performance relative to the overall market despite the strength of what we saw in 2022. 
 In terms of Q1 and backlog, I mean the deferred revenue hasn't really changed. We haven't had the issues that others have had in terms of having those -- the deferred revenue bloat up related to some of the supply chain challenges that were well chronicled. So that's fairly normal in terms of how we look at 2023. 
 The backlog did come down. We did some scrubbing related to the China export principally. So we saw some reductions there. We'll see the performance obligations come down about $1 billion overall. So some of that being the effect of the China dynamic, but also we did revenue at a level that was above the new bookings. 
 So not a lot, and there's still a significant amount of backlog, and I think that we'll see that play through as we move forward here. So some of that is tied to -- longer term, to facility projects out beyond 12 months. 45% to 55% of our backlog is for delivery outside the 12-month window. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the overall and our expectations for '23. 
Richard Wallace: And C.J., maybe just to add one thought. When we laid out our investor plan for '26, at the time we did that, we actually anticipated that there would be a contraction between '22 and '26. We obviously didn't know when, but we felt that, that was going to happen. And our assumptions for that model were based on our percent of WFE, which, as you know, is a combination of the process control intensity in our share.
 We don't see any degradation of that in '23 based on what we see. So we see holding percent of WFE or maybe continuing to make progress. So we still feel pretty good about the trajectory that we laid out in '26. And even though there will be -- these puts and takes based on projects that come and go, I think we feel pretty good, and we don't think '23 will be a problem relative to that longer-term plan. 
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up, you talked about expectations for gross margins north of 60% for the whole year, guided 61.5% for March. I guess this is kind of a 2-part question. I guess how do you see kind of a trough revenue quarter here? If you can answer that. And does that mean that we would be below 60% in the back half of calendar '23? Or you think you can stay north of 60% every quarter for the year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think we could stay above 60%. Look, there could always be quarter-to-quarter dynamics in a given quarter depending on the mix of the business that could drive us beneath that level, but our expectation is that for the year, we'll be better than that overall. 
 I would expect, and as we said over the course of last quarter, that we thought that Q1 was likely the higher quarter in the year and that we would see a drifting down in terms of the run rate. And just to make the math work, you would see a lower second half than the first half. So I think we'll likely stay north of a couple of billion in terms of revenue levels, and we should be able to hold 60% in terms of a run rate from a gross margin point of view. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: I wanted to kind of double-click on your WFE expectations and then how do you think about your model. Are you thinking about first half or second half WFE being relatively balanced for the year and then within your kind of forward revenue expectations for KLA as well? 
Bren Higgins: I think my statements earlier were more -- were KLA-centric, but I don't think we're going to deviate that much from overall WFE. Obviously, that gets into the other businesses and markets that we don't participate in. But generally, I would expect that we're at a higher run rate, a WFE run rate in the first part of this year than we are in the second. So yes, I would think that it's probably down. I don't know how much it's down, but it's probably lower in the second half than the first half. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Got it. And then just kind of maybe bigger picture. But one of your larger customers have talked about a temporary decline in the 7-nanometer utilization rates, but at the same time, also talking about working with their customers to introduce to backfill capacity, introduce new products over the next few years. I guess how do we think about that dynamic in the context of, like, your print check business and the mask shop? 
Richard Wallace: I think that it's much more -- it's baked into our assumptions on the overall reduction in WFE that they're going to be shifting. But I don't think the mix between our products is really going to change for that period if you think about where logic is positioned.
 The other thing, and Bren mentioned, as you know, as EUV gets increasingly adopted, even if it's at lower capacity, we'll see more demand for print check and in reticle in general. So the strength of those businesses, we think, continues on a relative basis, albeit in a declining overall market for some period of time. But those are product lines that right now, we don't -- we're still supply-constrained in terms of our ability to support customer needs on those products. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. If 7-nanometer capacity demand falls off, right, and we don't expect to impact, you would expect to see wafer starts maybe come down at that node, most of the investment we expect to see is at the more advanced nodes. Customers are always looking to optimize the productivity of their capacity. Depending on their views, it could be temporary, in which case they'll idle some of that capacity or run it at a lower utilization rate. 
 And then if in the longer run, they feel like they can move it, they'll try to move it. They do have the technical challenges though that if you were to move from 7 nanometer to 5 nanometer, you have the introduction of EUV from node to node. So the technical challenges of trying to reuse that capacity is much more difficult in this environment than it was, let's say, 10 years ago. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Your services business last year was strong, right? It was up 15%. Historically, like this segment does not decline during downturns, right? Very stable subscription services contracts, expanding support opportunities, legacy nodes, more software attach, et cetera. But you do have a transactional part of the business, right, tied to manufacturing activity. You've got your EPC services business in there as well and the impact from China export control. So lots of puts and takes. So does the team believe it can grow services revenues this year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Yes, you're right. We do have some puts and takes. But if you look at the -- and just for some history, right, if you look at our service business overall as it relates to Semi process control, we've only had 1 down year going back at least the last 20, maybe 25 years, and that was in 2009, where we're facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.
 So you're right that when things slow down, particularly in memory, as an example, customers will scale back in terms of the utilization of their equipment. But we still have a lot of equipment that's coming off of warranty that's going into contract that's been shipped over the last few years. Customers continue to run the installed base typically to support, even if they're not investing in new capability.
 EPC is a little more transactional, and I would expect EPC service to be flatter year-to-year. So I don't think we're going to grow like we did this year, where we grew 15%. But I would expect to see a mid- to high single-digit growth rate in services overall. 
 So I think when you look at our overall business, and we talked about Semi PC growing roughly in line overall with the market, maybe a little better than that. Service is growing mid- to high single digits. And I think EPC systems is going to be somewhere in less than -- have a decline, but a decline that's less than what we're seeing on the WFE side. So -- because we have had a weaker '22, that business is much closer to consumers. And so I think they entered into some of the more challenging environment a little bit sooner, but that's how we're thinking about the overall. 
Richard Wallace: And the other factor, Harlan, when you consider our business, our service is pure service, as we talked about. And also it's really not about consumables. So from the standpoint, their capacity goes down, some of the consumable related service business will go down as a result. Ours, because of the nature of what we do, and often, even if customers are constraining capacity, they're trying to optimize yield, and so that's why I think our service fares pretty well in this kind of environment. 
Harlan Sur: Great. I appreciate that. And strong patterning growth in 2022, I think patterning was up like 50%. Obviously, part of that is being driven by EUV, Deep EUV litho  adoption. And if you look at ASML's results, I mean that continues strong. But I think they're looking for EUV litho systems being signed off, units being signed off this year to grow, like, 40%, both for EUV and Deep EUV. So litho shipments are always sort of a good forward indicator for your business. You've got positive exposure via your wafer, your reticle inspection systems, print check, litho metrology. Is this going to be one of the -- it was clearly a bigger driver last year. Is this going to be one of the bigger drivers of the potential outperformance this year for the team? 
Richard Wallace: Well, I think you're right in some regards. And certainly, when it comes to technology transitions, a lot of what's driving the metrology is related to those tech transitions such as [ data ] all around, right? The work that's going on there is driving it. But there is a part of that business that's tied to capacity. So that's really puts and takes inside of that business. So it's not entirely just related to the tech. 
 And again, when you look at the overall market growth in the different segments, our view of lithography as part of WFE is a little different than what was stated maybe overall because of the deferred revenue component of that. So again, I think KLA is going to do well as we go forward in '23. And the metrology, as it pertains to technology advancement development, will be strong. And both in -- as both metrology and overlay related as companies, our customers try to advance in terms of the tech nodes that have a lot of challenges in those 2 areas. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. 
Vivek Arya: If you look at the full year WFE view of down 20%, right, in the kind of the mid $70 billion, that view -- that overall view doesn't seem to have changed in the last 3 months. But something else seems to have downshifted in the commentary from you and your peers. I'm just curious if -- Rick or Bren, if you would take a look back in the last 3 months, what has changed from an assumption perspective? Is there a certain part of the market that you are exposed to? Like, has there been any change in the last 3 months? Because the overall number doesn't seem to have changed. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, it's a good question. Not much has changed, frankly, in terms of how we've looked at it. Obviously, we had the strength of Q4, which contributes to the marginal weakness in the March quarter, where we had $184 million in incremental revenue above the midpoint in December. And so that clearly came out of the March quarter. So that puts a little bit of pressure on the March quarter. But as we look at the overall year, it generally looks very similar to what we had 3 months ago. So I don't think that much is different. It feels pretty consistent. 
Richard Wallace: Well, I guess, yes, it's kind of similar to what we said. But at the time, it wasn't what a lot of customers were saying yet, right? So at that time, there hadn't been as many announcements for CapEx reductions. So we kind of forecast that, that was going to happen. And so with that kind of the news, it kind of got to this point where we're about where we said. That wasn't the case when we first viewed what was probably going to be a correction in '23. So I would say it's kind of landed where we thought, but there was a fair amount of news in getting there as people said they're going to cut their CapEx. 
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, if I'm hearing you, March is perhaps not the trough quarter for the year that -- I don't know, maybe it's June or September. Any way to gauge what that kind of conceptually, the trough quarter could be? Because when I look at memory, I think it's only, what, 15% of process control in Q1. Is that the trough for memory? Or can it get even lower than that? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Vivek, I'm not going to guide each of the quarters. It feels today like things are stronger likely in the first half. There are some investments at the very end of the year that could cause the December quarter to be stronger depending on the timing of the fab construction. And so there are some things in -- I'll call it, in Q4 that could swing the quarter-to-quarter one way or the other. But as I said earlier, I think that the second half is likely lower than the first half, and I'll stick with that for now. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. 
Brian Chin: Maybe just to double back on the performance obligations. It sounds like -- I could be a little bit off here. But in terms of 12 months RPOs, maybe it's -- maybe ended the December quarter, kind of a $6 billion-ish kind of level. Is that about right? And is there a point in terms of as you draw that down a little bit maybe over the next few to several quarters, is there a point in the year you can kind of point to where you think that number will stabilize? 
Bren Higgins: So we're going to report -- we'll likely file our Q sometime in the next day or so, so you'll have the specifics on it. But your math is about right. It's a little bit higher than that, and we'd still expect 45% to 55% beyond 12 months. And as I said, some of the adjustments that were made were related to some more clarity around China export restrictions, so that was a factor in some of our adjustments. 
 I think as we progress through the year, look, we'll see how the order flow plays out over time. But -- and there's still work to be done in terms of whether we are able to continue to get some licenses that we're still working through in some time. That could have an effect as well. But I don't expect to see -- I think it's going to level off. I don't expect to see it come down all that much. I think it'll level off as we move forward over the course of the year. But look, things can change, and that's the best visibility I have today. 
Brian Chin: Okay. That's fair. And this is probably just digging into a question that was recently asked. But I mean, I think the math might suggest that in the March quarter, the memory system revenue could be something like $250 million, maybe $250 million to $300 million. Maybe that's not trough, but it seems pretty low comparable to recent periods and going back a little ways. And so maybe not trough, but not too far off. Is that kind of an unfair conclusion? 
Bren Higgins: I would have to -- yes, you're right. I mean, it's lower than it has been for a few years. I don't know if it was lower in any given quarter back, let's say, in late 2018 or early 2019 in that time frame. I'd have to look. But it's certainly, as a percent of the total, as low as it's been for some time. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. 
Sidney Ho: The revenue decline in the March quarter is a little more severe than we kind of expected. I guess, we had thought the revenue is relatively stable, especially given the large backlog you had going into the quarter. Is it just that you were able to pull in some of the revenues into the December quarter? Or was it my assumption that revenue could be stable in the near term was incorrect? 
Bren Higgins: Sidney, it's a great question, and you're absolutely right. It pulled in into the December quarter. When we started the quarter, we had risked out some of the… 
Operator: It seems we have lost speaker connection. Please hold, Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by as we work through this technical difficulty. 
 [Technical Difficulty] 
Kevin Kessel: Sorry, we got cut out there. I know it's in the middle of Bren's answer to Sidney. 
Bren Higgins: So Sidney, let me just start again. Your question was about just the quarter-to-quarter changes. And you're absolutely right that we did see the strength in Q4, and that was a pull forward from the March quarter. 
 As we were looking at the business back in October, we had some systems where we were dealing with some supply chain issues, particularly as it relates to broadband plasma and reticle inspection products. As we work through the quarter, we were able to work with those suppliers, get the parts we needed, run through our qualification processes and complete those tools. 
 Customers, given the demand and balance we've been dealing with for some time on these products, our ability to supply relative to where demand is, we're more than willing to take the products when we had them finished. So when you add the 2 quarters together, the number is basically the same. And our view here is, is we're going to keep the line moving, particularly as it relates to getting these systems out the door to meet customer requirements. And so we finished them, and we shipped them at the end of the quarter. 
Sidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. Can I ask a second question? You talked about expecting operating expenses to come down throughout the year. What is a good level to think about exiting this calendar year? Talk about maybe what are the areas you see more -- you'll see more of the cuts. And are there any of the actions impacting the gross margin positively as well? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think the gross margin guidance we gave earlier stands for itself and reflects some of the actions that we're taking just to deal with. One of the challenges in our factories is we're coming off, which drove our inventory issue that we had this quarter as well as we're coming off pretty high growth expectations in a pretty short period of time. 
 It wasn't that long ago when people were talking about $100 billion of WFE this year and $105 billion or more into '23, so $100 billion in '22. And so there's been about $30 billion plus of WFE that's come out in a relatively short period of time. That had an effect on some of the buying that we've done to drive our supply chain the way that we have. But also, it will have to deal with some of the underutilization of the factory resources that were put in place to support higher volume levels. 
 But the guidance I gave in terms of gross margin reflects those actions and what we plan to do. I would think that by the end of the year, we'll probably be looking at a quarterly run rate based on how we're running the business today. And our expectations for top line, somewhere in that, I'll say, somewhere around $530 million to $535 million. So we'll see it trend down as we go according to each quarter, more or less.
 And depending on how we see the top line evolving, not only as we look at the second half of the year, but as you start to look at '24 and size '24, then we'll come to a determination whether that is appropriate level for us to be at or whether we need to do more or less from there. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. 
Atif Malik: Sorry. Can you hear me? 
Kevin Kessel: Yes, we can hear you. 
Richard Wallace: Yes, we can hear you. 
Atif Malik: All right. So I have a question on the memory investments. Are you expecting memory CapEx reduction to be broad this year? Or just 1 or 2 memory makers? 
Richard Wallace: I'm expecting it to be pretty broad. And look, it'll vary by customer. And as you know, it's not our strongest market in terms of overall exposure, and we tend to be more focused on the technical part, right, technology roadmaps, less so than capacity. So when we look at it, I think it's pretty broad across all our customers, but varies according to some of them, right? I don't think they're all completely consistent. 
Atif Malik: Got it. And then on China WFE, are you expecting China WFE to be down as much as overall WFE? And what's holding China WFE? Is it the trailing edge investments? And what's driving higher investments on the trailing edge? Is it also end market or maybe higher process control intensity? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Most of the logic investment has been at the legacy nodes. The other thing that gives us some confidence about '23 that I had mentioned in the earlier answer was the infrastructure investment that's happening in China for mask investment, mask infrastructure and for wafer infrastructure, which is parts of WFE that we're exposed to that some of our peers are.
 So when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: There was a question before about EUV, and I'm wondering if you can sort of help give a number in terms of how much of your revenue attaches directly to EUV. There's not a ton of inspection in the litho cell, but you certainly get pulled along with anything that helps sort of horizontal scaling, so. And obviously, EUV does that. So I'm kind of wondering if you can handicap how much of your revenue gets carried along with EUV, and then I had a follow-up. 
Richard Wallace: Yes, Tim, we don't really break it out like that, but I can kind of give it a shot and talk about applications that are related. The main one, the most obvious one is -- that's new is print check, and that is inspection that's directly related to EUV. And I think the other one is, of course, all the reticle stuff. There is some overlay work that also happens relative to some of the matching challenges associated with EUV. 
 So I would say part of each of those markets, and if you had to add them all up, probably 15% to 20% of what we're -- overall, what we're doing in those markets is probably related directly to EUV as opposed to additional scaling. We can do some work and come back on that because it has been growing. The print check part has been driving a lot of the growth that we're seeing in the Gen 5, in particular, work that we're seeing. So that's kind of how I'd handicap it. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: I think that's good. 
Timothy Arcuri: Awesome, Rick. Super helpful. Bren, I had a question for you on process control systems. It seems like the guidance -- well, actually, it's a 2-part question. It seems like the March guidance implies something in the 16.5% range for process control segment -- systems. So I wanted you to confirm that, first of all. 
 And then the real question is the timing of when the process control systems bottoms. Because Lam's bottoming in March, but it seems like if I take low to mid-70s WFE, I assume you don't lose much WFE share. It's kind of hard to see the number not bottoming until you get to 1.1 roughly and you're still at 1.6. So can you sort of answer those for me? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So your first question about margin, and of course, we don't guide the individual segments. But your assumption of where we are in March is about right. Obviously, we're going to manage the whole company to the top-level numbers that we provided and not necessarily focus on the individual pieces.
 The drop-off that you -- and again, I'm not going to get into each of the quarters from a guidance point of view, but that would imply a fairly low number and then imply that I think that we would drop off more than overall WFE, current WFE expectations, which are down about 20% overall. So it's hard to say how much happens when. But 1.1 feels like a pretty low number. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, my first question is, just to play the devil's advocate. Last quarter, you said the process control argument was site-to-tech roadmap and transition and not as much as to capacity, i.e., less technical. But then, it seems like process control is not immune to the cyclicality. So I'm just kind of curious, like, are these just, like, regular cyclical issue? Is process control actually really driven by tech and not capacity purchases? And long lead time inspection doesn't matter anymore? I'm just kind of curious. Or do you think we get back to trend line in a couple of quarters? Any color on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-on. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I mean, I think it is the case, the process control, our business, in particular, is tied both to capacity, but also to tech transitions, and it's certainly not just a tech transition. So I think you'll see the people that are more tied to capacity coming down more in this environment, and people that are tied more to pure tech holding up, and we're kind of in the middle of those 2. Obviously, we have capacity businesses as they relate to, say, metrology that gets added as you add wafer starts. But the work that's going on in reticle and in advanced patterning inspections will be related much more to the Gen 4/Gen 5 stuff, which won't see as much of a decline. 
 So I think we're kind of -- we're more -- we have some more upside to capacity than maybe we did years ago. But we have -- at this point, certainly, a large part of our business is associated with technology transfers, and there's more transfers happening now than there have been in quite a while because the DRAM guys, memory is -- as low as their level of investment is in capacity, as in none, they're still driving technology transitions. And we know there are multiple players now in logic trying to move forward on that. 
 So I'd say it's a balanced approach, which is why we think we'll outperform this year, but not -- we're not going to hold flat relative to that because we definitely had some capacity components. So no, I don't say that we're immune to it, but I think we're less sensitive than pure capacity plays. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Krish, we did share the market move in 2021, right, from below 6 percentile to the high 7 percentile. And so that clearly was driven by, not just the technology transition that we talked a lot about, but also higher exposure to capacity opportunities. And we talked about this at Investor Day that with scaling with a more robust design environment, less reuse overall and more process flows, that our customers were investing more in capacity from KLA in capacity environments because they're managing each design, test design rules in different ways, different process flows as [ there's ] a change in complexity into the fab. And for all those reasons, we were seeing more adoption of process control in what we'll call a more mature state in the fab. 
 So obviously, that's the part that falls off as customers adjust those capacity plans. But to Rick's point, most of our leverage is in the development area, and it has the fab scales. And so that's why we feel pretty good about dynamics driving our relative performance this year and a continuation of the SAM expansion that we've seen over the last couple of years. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Super helpful. And as a quick follow-up, Intel just said a while ago, they extended their depreciation from 5 to 8 years. I'm just kind of curious if that -- does that mean that extending the useful life of semi-cap equipment from 5 to 8 years? And what does that mean for semi -- for process control tools? If you can extend the use of the equipment, does it mean that less purchasing over the longer term? 
Richard Wallace: So the actual useful life of equipment has been going up for years, and we showed that in some of our service work. Part of why our service business is growing is because the life extends well beyond the typical -- the historical view of that. So I don't think that this is anything other than some recognition. There are different practices around the world with how customers choose to amortize or depreciate their equipment. So no, it has no effect. 
 I think we're back to the same conversation about what drives reuse and what drives the next generation has to do with node migration and the ability for customers to -- in the case when they -- what we've seen a lot of now is filling in of the nodes that historically might have been just moved forward. So no, no change in a long-term view based on that decision by one customer. 
Bren Higgins: And you're seeing demand rise in the legacy parts of the market, and that's been good for, not only the service business and extending useful life, but we're also restarting older generation tools. It's allowing us to extend the life of existing platforms that we're selling. Some of our challenges around supply chain has been restarting some of those older generation tools to meet those demands. 
 So I think it's a reflection of, at least, to Rick's point in how it affects equipment overall, reflection of the strength of some of those markets and those opportunities. The good thing is as we are able to sell those tools, the incremental R&D to support those markets is fairly low. And so it creates a nice vector, not only of growth for us, but also growth in our profitability and leverage in our model. 
Kevin Kessel: Chelsea, I believe we're coming close to the bottom of the hour, top of the hour. We probably have time for one more question. 
Operator: Our last question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: I just had a couple of housekeeping questions, if that's okay. The China impact, the export restriction impact in the December quarter and what you're assuming for calendar '23, Bren, sorry if I missed this, but if you can remind us how big the impact could be -- or was in Q4 and how... 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So no change to what we talked about last quarter overall. We talked about a range of $500 million to $900 million across the business in terms of its impact to 2023, and so I don't have an update to that or a different view at this point. We'll see as we go, active engagement. 
Toshiya Hari: Got it. And then on DRAM versus NAND, I think when you were going through the WFE assumption, you mentioned your expectation for DRAM to be down more than NAND. But when you think about your own business, KLA's business, I would expect DRAM to be a little bit more resilient given EUV adoption insertion and the benefits there. Is that the right way to think about your business in calendar '23 on a relative basis? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Yes. And I would expect our DRAM business to be stronger than our NAND as a percent. Yes. 
Kevin Kessel: Great. Thank you, everybody, for your time. We know it's a really busy day of earnings. We also apologize for the technical difficulties we had during the call, but we will be catching up with all of you here afterwards. So I appreciate the interest and speak soon. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the KLA Corporation December 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2022-10-26 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Brittany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q1 2023 Earnings Call to discuss the results of the September quarter and our December quarter outlook. Joining me is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close in the form of a press release, shareholder letter and slide deck, which can all be found on the KLA IR website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some brief quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment, including our business in China. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with the financial highlights as well as our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?
Richard Wallace: Thank you all for joining us today. I'll spend some time sharing highlights of KLA's performance in the quarter, touch on our business in China and provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment. Before we get into details, I'd like to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who have continued to demonstrate perseverance in navigating dynamic challenges to deliver for our customers. Their commitment is evident in our results. KLA's September quarter demonstrates strong customer demand across major product groups. Specifically for this quarter, record revenue of $2.7 billion was at the top of the guidance range, growing 31% on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped $1 billion for the first time. GAAP earnings per share was $7.20 and non-GAAP EPS was $7.06, each above guidance ranges. Our performance is a reflection of the increasingly essential role Process Control plays in the development of enabling technology and the long-term product road maps of our customers. As drivers for semiconductor demand continue to diversify beyond traditional PC and consumer-facing markets, Process Control is considered critical in enabling customers to execute on node and technology transitions. As this demand backdrop continues to evolve, our KLA operating model ensures focus on delivering for our customers, navigating supply chain challenges and continued investment in R&D. Now I will quickly summarize key highlights for the quarter. First, KLA continues to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers and is positioned to be one of the fastest-growing Tier 1 WFE equipment suppliers in calendar 2022, substantially outperforming expected overall WFE market growth. Second, our Patterning systems revenue grew 49% sequentially and 67% on a year-over-year basis. Third, KLA delivered strong quarterly revenue in our SPTS segment. KLA has intensified efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolios of both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC groups. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew to $529 million in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Finally, operating cash flow topped $1 billion for the first time, and we generated quarterly free cash flow of $927 million and free cash flow margin of 34%. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, total free cash flow grew from 37% to $3.14 billion. Total capital returns in the quarter were $278 million, comprising $90 million in share repurchases and $188 million in dividends paid. Total capital returns over 12 months ended September 30 were $5.2 billion or 166% of free cash flow and included $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends. Early in October, the U.S. government issued new regulations to control aspects of the U.S. semiconductor industry trade with China. Specific to KLA, a meaningful amount of our business in China is focused on legacy node investment, which is not the focus of the recent export restrictions. However, our system and service revenue will be adversely impacted going forward as we are unable to provide systems and support to certain customers for certain end users. We are assessing the broader implications and engaging collaboratively with the U.S. government to provide the necessary information about our products and services to fully determine the impact on our business operations moving forward. As we look at the industry demand environment, growth for the semiconductor industry has evolved to be more strategic with more diverse end market mix. For the near term, the recognized excess inventories driven by a slowdown in consumer electronics markets, such as PC and mobility, is having an impact on semiconductor device pricing, particularly in Memory. As a result, semiconductor customers are adjusting CY '23 CapEx budgets lower, with the largest impact to date coming from Memory customers. However, long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry continues due to the prioritization of R&D investment at the leading edge, continued investment in legacy nodes and growth in enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. Considering all factors, KLA's long-term targets announced at our Investor Day in June remain intact. In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate sustainable outperformance and highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our teams continue to navigate and execute against dynamic challenges, and KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio to meet evolving customer requirements. The KLA operating model and our strategic objectives are the foundation for our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, strong free cash flow generation and consistent returns to shareholders. Now our CFO, Bren Higgins, will review our September quarterly financial highlights and outlook. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thank you. As you heard from Rick, KLA's September quarter results were strong, better than expected and demonstrated our consistent successful execution. While supply chain challenges continue in certain areas and are still limiting output, we have seen marginal improvement as new supplier capacity has come online to meet our requirements. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading growth and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of assertive capital allocation is what makes us successful. Quarterly revenue was $2.724 billion at the top of the guided range of $2.475 billion to $2.725 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $7.06, above the guided range of $5.70 to $6.80. GAAP diluted EPS was $7.20. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40 basis points, above the midpoint of guidance at 63.4% at Semiconductor Process Control systems, which carry stronger gross margins delivered virtually all the revenue upside from the guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $526 million, slightly below our expectation of $530 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 44.1%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income topped the $1 billion level for the first time ever. GAAP net income was $1.03 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion. And free cash flow was $927 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 92% and a free cash flow margin of 34%. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets in major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with almost $3 billion in total cash, debt of $6.3 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. Our balance sheet offers a unique capability to fund our growth strategies, both organic and inorganic, and providing ongoing attractive capital returns to shareholders. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends paid with total capital returns amounting to 166% of free cash flow. Turning to our outlook. KLA continues to deliver sequential growth and strong relative financial performance. Based on the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, KLA is positioned for mid-20% revenue growth for the total company in calendar '22, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. Furthermore, this business is expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE industry growth, which is currently projected to be up mid- to high single digits to the low $90 billion range. Looking ahead, we expect industry spending to slow. Though early, we are planning our business based on the expectation of CY '23 WFE declining approximately 20% based on increasing global macroeconomic concerns and recent public statements from several customers, particularly in Memory, and the impact of the new U.S. government regulations on native China investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current tops-down assessment of industry demand as follows. In Memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market as Memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. We expect Foundry/Logic to decline less than the overall market. Specific to KLA, we are still assessing the impact of the new China export regulations. Our preliminary assessment for the combined gross direct impact on our revenue based on our existing backlog and sales funnel forecast is in the range of approximately $600 million to $900 million in calendar '23. This reflects systems and service impact with service representing approximately 10% to 15% of the total. This estimate is before any potential system reallocation for products where supply is meaningfully below current demand, which has resulted in significant lead time to other customers. Given our backlog and forecast, we expect that we will be able to reallocate certain tools to other customers as we move through next year. KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition is focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of business environment. While capacity plans can change, technology road map investment tends to be more resilient. This adds additional confidence in our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. Our December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion, plus or minus $150 million. The gross direct impact of the new China regulations on the December quarter revenue guidance is approximately $100 million. Foundry/Logic is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and Memory is expected to be around 24% of Semi PC systems revenue. Within Memory, DRAM is expected to be about 55% of the segment mix and NAND 45%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63.5% due primarily to expected product and segment mix. Looking ahead, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives with the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, operating expenses will grow to approximately $550 million in the December quarter with growth in quarterly operating expenses expected to flatten out as we move through calendar '23. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $66 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.94 to $7.34 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.30 to $7.70. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 140 million shares. In conclusion, although the CY '23 outlook for WFE demand has softened, we remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors are playing in influencing national industrial policy and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain important trends. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. For KLA, considering our strong track record of execution and the power of our portfolio strategy, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable relative outperformance. We will continue to maintain a high level of investment in our product development road maps to enable market share expansion and support customers' technology road maps and multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us to continue to deliver strong relative performance as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, consistent operational excellence and differentiation across the diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, industry-leading financial performance, history of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin?
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Operator, can you please queue for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. As you mentioned, the team has been outperforming WFE and Process Control spending growth for the last few years. No different this year, right? I mean it looks like given your December quarter guidance, your Process Control systems business is going to be up like 30% to 35% when WFE is only up high single digit. I know in the last downturn, like 2019, not as severe, but has potentially 2023 is, but you guys actually grew your Process Control and services revenues when WFE was down back then. So kind of given all of this, like do you think guys just provide some sort of rough framework for thinking about the team's revenue and earnings power potential with industry spending down about 20% next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. It's Bren. Thank you for the comments, and I'll start here, and Rick can join after. So I think the way to think about KLA performance is typically, historically, most of the volatility we've seen in WFE has been in the Memory space. And as you know, Process Control intensity and Memory is quite a bit lower than it is in Foundry and Logic. So I think you have to go back a couple of decades. I think we've outperformed WFE in any down year that WFE has had. So I think that that's always been an anchor for us. We also tend to support customers that are investing in their road maps, right? So as they pull back on their capacity investments, they continue to invest in technology, and so there's a certain amount of business that -- with KLA that continues to happen almost irrespective of their revenue levels. So that tends to be a factor for us as well. And then finally, customers usually continue to run the installed base, and so service is -- continues to operate. We have a contract strain that is the majority of the revenue of 75% plus of the revenue. And so while they're pulling back on CapEx investments, they still tend to run the installed bases pretty heavily. And given how they buy Process Control generally in terms of buying what they need and rely on us to maximize uptime for those systems that it tends to also be an anchor as we move through down periods in the CapEx environment.
Harlan Sur: Great. And then on my follow-up, good to see the strong EUV mask inspection shipments and Patterning segment was up almost 70% year-over-year. I think that's reflective of the strong EUV adoption this year. And despite the weaker WFE backdrop for next year, I think that the EUV lithography outlook continues to be strong, right? I mean continued penetration of EUV into Memory and Logic and Foundry, and so this should bode well or continue to bode well for your mask inspection demand. But I know last year the mask inspection segment underperformed positive control on growth. What's the team's outlook for your mask inspection business this year and next year, given the relatively better fundamental outlook in lithography?
Bren Higgins: So yes, Harlan, you have it right. So this year is actually a very strong year for reticle inspection. I would expect reticle inspection to outperform the overall Semi PC business within the company. So a very strong year and certainly driven by EUV as 90% plus of EUV reticles in production are running through KLA systems. As we look at next year, I think that there will be continued demand there as you see the -- start to see more investment in the 3-nanometer node. So I would expect the  [ rapid ] business to probably continue to perform better than Semi PC. There's also some investment in infrastructure that's happening in some of the legacy mask inspection and new infrastructure that's being built in China to support the legacy reticles, and so there's also an aspect of investment that's happening there as well. So I would expect it to have another good year this year, a strong year in '22, but also a strong year '23 as well.
Richard Wallace: Yes. And one other thing, Harlan, I think that -- one of the things that contributed to our strength is share gain due to new capabilities on our products. So part of what we were in development for was continuing extending the 6xx product to be able to serve more of the EUV market. So as we do that, we saw some performance. So overall, the segment is good, and then we had some -- the benefit of some share gain as well.
Operator: We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Rick, just wanted to follow up on the earlier question. I understand you guys typically outperform Process Control like a normal cyclical downturn. But if you overlay the fact that some of your peers had supply issues, which you of course did not, and Process Control tends to be more early cyclical. If you overlay those 2 components do you still expect your Process Control revenue to outperform WFE next year? And then I have a follow-up.
Richard Wallace: We do for 2 reasons. One  it is true that some of them had more challenges than we did, but we had our own. We could have shipped -- we built backlog, we could have shipped more if we had more capacity. But the other thing is the decline in WFE is going to be based more in Memory than in Foundry and Logic. So that alone helps us in terms of the mix. So I think we're in pretty good position to outperform WFE. Nobody really knows, of course, what '23 is going to look like. But with that set-up, we're in pretty good shape.
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Rick. And then just a follow-up on services. What percentage of your services is from China or domestic China? And also if WFE is down 20%, what do you think happens to service business next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes. I don't think we've broken that out. I would say it's less than -- if our systems business in China and Semi PC is somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would expect the service stream is less because it's less developed, right? It's newer in terms of the investment that's happened, and so it would be lower than as a mix of service revenue than that is a mix of system revenue. I would expect service to continue to grow next year. I think it will be below the -- in that WFE environment, it'd be below what our long-term growth rate target of 12% to 14%. I think it will probably be somewhere in single digits. There is a little bit of an FX headwind that happens to service as you have the strong dollar but you have a lot of service revenues denominated in local currencies. You gave a little bit of a natural hedge because you also have cost denominated as well. But there is a little bit of a headwind that's coming on service revenue growth from FX. But I think we'll probably be somewhere in kind of mid-to high single-digit service growth given expectations of WFE that are down 20%.
Richard Wallace: Krish, when we set the  [ '26 plan ] at our Investor Day, we didn't know when, but we anticipated there'd be this digestion period of WFE just based on the historic growth, so we're still modeling the targets that we set out for [ '26 ]. And we didn't know when, but it seems like it's coming in '23, and we weren't sure if it was '23 or '24, but it was going to be in that period. But overall, we feel pretty good about where we are positioned relative to that longer-term trend line. And as Bren said, we'll go under it, but then we've got a lot of systems that are shipping now, for example, that will come off warranty. And so they'll be going into services as we move forward, and feel pretty good about where we are relative to the long-term services plan.
Operator: We will take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore.
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, I was hoping you could speak to changes in backlog over the last 3 months, how you're kind of incorporating the changes around domestic China embargo. And when are you expecting to get back to kind of your normalized lead times of 6 to 7 months?
Richard Wallace: C.J., it's a good question. And we'll have the specific numbers in the 10-Q, which we'll likely file on -- probably by the end of this week. But we did grow backlog a little bit. So remaining performance obligations will be somewhere in the mid-13 range. So some modest growth of 13.1 as a reference point in the June quarter. We did scrub a little bit of the backlog given the new China regulations. I think there's more work to be done there as we move into the December quarter. It's still fairly fluid, and we're working through our own assessment of the new regulations and engaging with the government about how to think about certain situations there. So I would expect to see a little bit come out. Certainly, we grew it a little bit this quarter, and I expect a little bit more effort or a little bit more there as we move into the December quarter.
Bren Higgins: So I think from a lead time point of view, it's been a very across certain products. And we have certain products that are high-end sort of technology-enabling products like broadband plasma inspection, our retical inspection tools, our Voyager laser scanning system, SP7 Surfscan products. Those lead times remain very extended. I think it will take some time because we're dependent on incremental capacity to come online to be able to work through some of that backlog. And I would expect those customers to stay in the queue given the long-term sort of demand dynamics around that -- those particular products. But as it relates to some of our more capacity-centric products, I would expect some normalization as we move into '23. I think certainly, we're still constrained today in a lot of areas, and I would expect that we'll see that continue for a little while. But I think as we move through '23, we'll get up with a little bit more flexibility and more normalization on certain more capacity-centric product.
Christopher Muse: Very, very helpful. As a quick follow-up, I think you talked about $100 million of gross risk related to the China impact for December. And, I guess -- what does the net number look like there? I mean should we just be pulling out kind of $10 million to $15 million from service to reflect that and that you're perhaps repurposing the remaining tools so the net effect is much less? Or how should we think about that?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think, the easiest way to think about it approximately -- without the new regulations, our guidance would have been approximately $100 million higher, right? I think the mix that I talked about earlier in terms of service versus system is about the same in this quarter versus the longer term. And the ability to reallocate those systems in the short run a little bit harder. So I think that as we move into next year, we'll -- I think we'll be able to reallocate more, including some of what we expected here. But, I think, in the shorter run, much harder for us to do. So I think the easiest way to think about it is the way I described it.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.
Vivek Arya: Just one more on China. Can you help us put this $600 million to $900 million in context with what you're currently doing. In the last 12 months, China sales were about $2.8 billion. Obviously, it's both domestic and multi. So is this $600 million to 900 million derisk enough? And how much is left and what is left once the $600 million to $900 million goes out of your addressable opportunity next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes. It's -- I think it's derisked. We try to provide a range to give you some perspective. Certainly, there's some forecast but it's part of that. But as we looked at what we have in backlog and we looked at what we expect to book over the course of '23 for the affected customers, we were able to go tool by tool to come up with the range that I provided. And service is roughly 10% to 15% of that. We will see as we move forward. Again, we're at a very preliminary stage in terms of working through the regulations and also engaging with customers. There's the possibility that we're able to get some of that back as we move forward, but we'll have to see how that plays out. As I said in the prepared remarks, it is tied to the legacy parts of our business, which are really unaffected by the new regulations. Most of what was considered 14-nanometer and below was already derisked from our plans because we were dealing with similar guidance back in the June quarter. And so what -- the biggest part of the change was the restrictions on the Memory business. And so, I think, we feel pretty good about the range given where we are, the range we provided.
Vivek Arya: And just as a follow-up, I had a longer-term more conceptual question. I know we are far away from '24. But as people look forward and especially this topic of WFE intensity, in the last 2 years, it grows about 15% to 16%. But before that, the industry used to be around the 13%, 14% level. Do you think as the industry recovers, we kind of stay at the 13%, 14%? Or do you think there's a case to be made that WFE intensity can start to recover back to the levels that we have seen in the last 2 years?
Richard Wallace: Yes. I mean when we look at the longer term -- and it's a great question. And actually, that's the one that I think is the one that we've been spending a lot of time thinking about. The intensity is related to a couple of factors, obviously, but one of them is the challenge with the advanced technology nodes associated with it. And I think part of why it went back up was that scaling resumed, and scaling has resumed both in what we've seen in Logic/Foundry but also in Memory. So I do think it is going to trend slightly higher than it was, that it will be in '19 -- or '23, but it will go back up. Whether it goes all the way back up, it's not exactly clear, but I do think there's going to be pressure on that for people, everybody that's trying to move forward in technology. And the one thing that we know will happen during '23 even if there's a slowdown in capacity, there won't be a slowdown in technology advancement because everybody knows the way you get out of the downturn is by having newer products. So I think it does trend back up. Whether it goes back all the way, we'll wait and see. But I think there's some improvement in capital intensity, and then we're on the strong belief that Process Control intensity will hold on to some of the gains that we've made and potentially build on them as we bring new products in.
Bren Higgins: Yes. Fundamental to our thesis was that we would see semiconductor revenue grow, and WFE would grow slightly faster. So you'd have a flat to up trend line in WFE intensity that would be faster than semiconductor revenue, predicated on the things that Rick talked about, but also that a lot of the dynamics in the industry that drove significant efficiency in WFE have been worked out of the system. And what I mean by that is things like wafer transitions or normal wafer transitions, the consolidation that we saw in the industry and so on because some of the bigger factors. So our view is that there will be a lot of pressure for customers to try to keep it from growing, but that we were growing faster than it is. But most of what is talked about [ different ] customers is to keep it from growing faster, not to keep it from -- to drive it down. And so I think that there's -- we think the long-term assumption that's there is, I think, a fairly straight down the middle assumption in terms of how we think about long-term.
Richard Wallace: Yes. And there's one additional fact. When you look at the regionalization efforts and you think about new fabs around the world, they will tend to be slightly less efficient, which will drive up the efficiency, and those numbers are not really in anything in calendar '23.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore: Great. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the export restrictions. You guys have talked about seeing the Logic restrictions coming, I think, before, and I heard from anyone else. Where were you surprised on the Logic side? And then as a bigger picture question. The fact that this could affect the multinationals, but the multinationals immediately have a license for a year, do you think that gives any kind of pause to investing in Chinese fabs for the multinationals, who could find themselves with large assets that they're unable to upgrade if there's a change in policy? Just can you kind of assess how your customers are talking about all of this?
Richard Wallace: Yes, Joe, this is not an area where we're going to provide much insight. I think from the standpoint, I think what you meant is that we see the Memory restrictions coming, right, because we talked about the Logic ones. We were not surprised by the export controls that were implemented. And as we've mentioned, we've been working with the government officials as they've implemented those. So we're not surprised by that. When I talk to customers about their plans in China, I think, a lot of what they're doing is trying to figure out what are the implications of those extensions and what's the long-term viability. So I would say that it's a much better question to ask them than us. And ultimately, from our standpoint, frankly, it doesn't matter that much because if they choose not to invest there, what they're doing is investing to support demand and they'll move that investment to where they could do it. So that's kind of the way they're talking about it and what we're seeing. So I think from our standpoint, a lot of the -- now that this has happened, we're in a much better position to not speculate but support as we move forward.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.
Joseph Quatrochi: Last quarter, you had talked about productivity, your manufacturing staying relatively similar rates in the second half into the first half of next year. Is that still how you're thinking about? And maybe in that context, how do you think about that relative to gross margin?
Bren Higgins: Yes. Look, we -- as you see in the guidance, right, we have another step-up in output expectations out of the factories and are still driving to deliver into the first part of the year. I mean, certainly, there's been some customer churn that we've seen. Most of -- sort of adjustments to our outlook are more from a top-down perspective in terms of engagement with certain customers and also public information. I think we'll have to see how it plays through. But right now, we are driving the factories to continue to deliver against what our customers have asked us for. So I think we'll have to see how it plays out, but we start to see some rescheduling as we move into '23. I think those are still questions out there, given just the dynamics we're seeing on the macro front and what we're hearing from customers. But for now, I think our view on the first part is somewhat consistent with what I've said in the past. But I'll have more to say about half to half in the March guidance when we get there.
Joseph Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Maybe going back to the Investor Day. Now with the new China export restrictions in limiting some of the emerging China customers, how do you think about that maybe changing the long-term growth CAGR that you outlined at the Analyst Day in terms of WFE, your capital intensity? Does it change given those guys are maybe trying to ramp up on the technology front and so spending a little bit more than say some of the more mature customers?
Richard Wallace: Well, it really goes back to the -- it's a good question, and we had contemplated rationalization of WFE in support of the overall industry. So that's really how I think about that is that, ultimately, there -- most of our customers end up having pretty strict investment forecast based on their belief of the capital intensity that they can afford, and you aggregate that up to the industry. And it kind of goes back to, well, what are your assumptions about semiconductor industry growth? What are your assumptions about capital intensity and what are your assumptions about Process Control. Those are all in the band of what we considered when we looked at the investment that was going to happen there. So yes, it may be that there was some investment without the revenue to support it. But eventually, it was going to get rationalized. And then we go back to believe in the semiconductor industry growth. You believe in, overall, the question we answered earlier on capital intensity. So it's pretty much baked in the numbers. The reason we set it out for '26 instead of sooner was, as I mentioned before, we felt like there was going to be some kind of digestion period, which we're now facing into, so you kind of get there. As I mentioned, there will be some investment that when you look at some of this regionalization that hasn't happened yet that would have been upside to that plan, and now I think you end up it kind of all blends together. So if you believe the semiconductor growth, I don't think capital intensity goes down, and we feel pretty good about Process Control and our share, that's supportive of the numbers that we laid out. In addition, Bren already talked about the services, which is another big part of it. So a very long way to say we feel like we're still on target for our '26 plan.
Bren Higgins: Yes. You left out the EPC part, too. I think that's one where certainly we're feeling pressure this year and would expect to see more volatility in that part of the business given its proximity to consumers. But we still have an expectation that through SAM growth there that we will see similar growth rates there as well. So we talked about '21 to '26 overall. Rick said we modeled some of the -- some softness in between, but we still feel good about the underlying assumptions of what we laid out.
Operator: We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: So I have 2 questions. The first one is the near term. If I look at your December quarter guidance, can you help us with the growth difference between SPC and EPC? And I know this EDC was down quite a bit quarter-over-quarter, maybe just seasonality in Q1. And then related to that, if you can unpack the guidance for gross margin a little bit, it's down about 100 basis points at the midpoint, can you talk about the pluses and minuses and specifically related to revenue impact of the China regulation? Does that have a gross impact on gross margin? And I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Oh, good question. So in terms of guidance for December, all the incremental revenue is coming just about all that's likely to come from our Semi Process Control business. I would think there'd be some impact from the new China regulations on service and the ability to grow service quarter-to-quarter. EPC was down. I think it will be up modestly quarter-to-quarter, but the bulk of the revenue increase will come from Semi PC. So I think in terms of gross margin in the September quarter, it was most of the upside, and I think we did better overall in Semi PC than we expected, and EPC was a little bit weaker on the margin than we thought going into the quarter. So we had a very strong mix of business. We had a significant sequential growth in Patterning. Patterning includes reticle inspection, which tends to be a richer product line from a gross margin point of view. So that was the biggest impact that drove the upside. I think as we look at December, again, it will come back to mix dynamics in terms of how we model the business. We're kind of operating in line with the long-term range that I've talked about is somewhere between 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points or so, and we've been operating fairly consistent with that if you look at the broader picture of calendar '22. So we'll see how it plays out. We've certainly been driving the business at a higher level in terms of output expectations. If you just go back to June, what was the consensus expectation for WFE both this year but also into '23? So that's certainly been a factor in terms of how we've been sizing our business in terms of our ability to support and to ship. And as we move into '23 and we see some of that, it could create a little bit of inventory exposure from an excess inventory point of view. So it could have some incremental reserve exposure there as well that we contemplated as we thought about December. So those are the puts and takes. I think the China regs in terms of impact on gross margin, it's more of a revenue impact. I don't think there's anything incremental from a gross margin point of view one way or the other.
Sidney Ho: That's helpful. Great. My follow-up question is back to a cycle question here. In prior down cycles, KLA usually outperformed initially because customers want improved yields, maybe continue to invest in R&D. But essentially, the downturn -- eventually, the downturn would catch up after several quarters, maybe just Memory gets CapEx at first and then time Foundry/Logic comes later. Remind us of why you think this time could be different. And what kind of visibility into 2023 do you have right now just based on cancellation and rescheduling, those kind of things?
Bren Higgins: So we haven't had any cancellations. And there has -- the rescheduling that there's been, I'll call it, churn in our backlog management, but backlog grew quarter-to-quarter. I would expect that we'll see more cancellations as we move into '23. But what we said in terms of guidance of the industry down approximately 20% or so and given our expectations around the mix of business and so on and the history that we would expect KLA to perform well in that environment from a share of WFE point of view. So I think to your other point, look, it depends on how long these soft periods last in terms of how customers ultimately adjust and then what are the demand drivers as they come out of it. But as I said before, we're much more levered to our customers' technology road maps than the increment of capacity. We're certainly doing much better in capacity investment than we used to do, particularly around some of the issues we talked about at Investor Day due to higher design starts and less reuse and so on. So those are all factors for us that are positive from a capacity point of view. But at the end of the day, the biggest part of KLA's business is exposed to development and ramping up production. So as long as technology road maps hold together, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned.
Richard Wallace: Yes. And let me add to that. I mean, at Investor Day, we talked more about our exposure, as Bren said, and the ability we have to scale when there's capacity. I think the other thing that's changed, particularly with EUV is we're actually more an enabling technology now. And before, we might have been more about yield management. And now with some of our products, particularly in BBP and in rapid, those are the tools that our customers have repeatedly said, "No matter what happens in this downturn, keep us on your list. We want those tools." So I think that we've broadened from being primarily a company associated with ramping yields to one of enabling technology, particularly around EUV and then in capacity. So I think we have better exposure, which is why we feel pretty good about how our products are holding up and the fact that we are getting very clear signals from customers that are saying, "We understand we're slowing overall, but please do not take us out of the list. We need those tools, and we need them as soon as we can get them."
Operator: We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I also had a question on Process Control systems. And I ask because 2023 is going to be kind of a weird year because there's about $4 billion to $5 billion worth of deferred WFE just from 2 of your peers that should have been WFE this year but really is going to become WFE next year, and that sort of optically creates maybe like a little bit of a headwind for your WFE share. So I'm wondering if you can sort of help sift through that and maybe size what your PC systems would be for calendar '23. It seems like $6 billion is a pretty reasonable bogey, but I'm wondering if you like that number or not.
Bren Higgins: Tim, I don't want to guide '23. We're a little bit early on that. I think you're right that there is some of the deferred revenue dynamic that will maybe skew the numbers a bit. But I think also given the things that we just said about how we're positioned into '23 from a backlog point of view and from a technology point of view that we feel pretty comfortable with our share of WFE continuing. But also, I think, we feel very good about the actual market share within Process Control and the -- we think, some tailwinds there as well. So, I think, against the backdrop that you're talking about. If you're thinking WFE is somewhere in the $75 billion-ish range or so, the kinds of numbers are reasonable that you're mentioning. But I'll have the ability, I think, to provide a little bit more clarity around how we see that as we move into guidance for '23 in January.
Timothy Arcuri: Cool. And then, Rick, I had one for you. There was a question earlier about WFE intensity. And if you take -- the China restrictions are taking like between $7 billion and $9 billion out of WFE for next year, maybe some of that gets replaced somewhere else. But you see all the wafers and all the yields. So would you agree that maybe domestic China WFE has sort of inflated WFE intensity to some degree over the past couple of years? And maybe it's fair to take like a 50% multiplayer? I mean I don't want a number, but just the idea that you should take some sort of a handicap toward the WFE is the dollars because the productivity of those dollars is not equivalent to dollars being spent beyond China. I'm just sort of wondering how you kind of think about that.
Richard Wallace: Yes, Tim. No, I think that's true. I think that is absolutely the case that you have a situation where there was additional WFE. But it's interesting because that investment didn't really utilize EUV, so that wasn't particularly capital-intensive investment on a relative basis. So in fact, they were prevented from it. So I think over time, there is going to be more pressure on everybody that stays on the technology road maps to invest in technology that leverages, frankly, more to KLA, whether it's in Logic, Foundry or Memory. And so that's why, as we said, we modeled that. It is true that will come out, but it will over time be replaced. So I think, sure, the capital intensity was probably running a bit hot because of that, but that's going to get reset. So I don't think we go back into where we were, but I don't think we go all the way down either. I think it's somewhere in between, and that's how we modeled our 2026 plan.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I would say it's more efficient today than it was in 2016 when we saw all this escalation in investment. So there is a little bit more maturation there than what we have, let's say, 5, 6 years ago. But generally, I would also agree. I think you also have to remember that there's investment that's happening in infrastructure to support legacy domestic consumption, right? And so you have wafer investment that's happening. You have some reticle investment that's happening as well. So I think when you look at that, there is that question about how much of that is real demand versus more strategic investment. And so I think that that's -- there is some adjustment factor there, but it's probably a little bit different than what you might have thought 5 years ago or so. As you think about Process Control intensity, typically in legacy nodes, we tend to then do fairly well as facilities are starting up. But Process Control intensity in the trailing edge, unless they're there are big drivers of some major change, doesn't really -- isn't really as high as it is at the leading edge. So when you think about Foundry, Logic, Process Control intensity at the trailing edge, it's more like Memory, maybe a little bit better than that in China, but it isn't like a leading-edge investment would provide. So it's a little bit different environment there from a KLA point of view.
Operator: We will take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: I had 2 questions as well. Bren, on the China impact, in calendar '23, which you sized at $600 million to $900 million, I think that was a gross number. So just curious, given the fungibility of your tools and based on your current pipeline, roughly what percentage of that do you think you can repurpose and ship to other customers, at least on the systems side?
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think it's too early to tell, Toshiya. What we try to do, and I purposely use those words that was gross. I think as we move forward, there are certain products that we will be able to repurpose fairly easily, and there are other ones that might be a little bit more difficult depending that they're back to the sort of capacity versus technology discussion we had earlier. So I'll have a clearer picture on how to think about that. But the way I thought about it was, as I said earlier, I looked at the backlog and I looked at our forecast in terms of expectation and timing of revenue and added up what we -- absent the new regulations, what -- how much revenue we would have, and that drove the range that I provided. And then we'll have to see also, as I said earlier, how as we progress here moving forward, what is truly kind of out and what is in as we start to work our way through and engage with customers and get a clearer picture from the government as we go through. So I think that's the best way I can size it right now is that impact, and I would expect for more higher end products where lead times are extended that we'll be able to reallocate some of those tools.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to get your thoughts on OpEx into calendar '23. I think it's fair to say that the WFE outlook has deteriorated over the past 3 months or so given Memory weakness and the export controls, your business is going to be a lot more resilient than the overall market. But just given how the trajectory has potentially changed from a revenue perspective, I'm sure you're sort of thinking through and revisiting your footprint into '23. How should we think about OpEx? I think you talked about on a quarterly basis, things moderating into Q1. But for the full year, if you can provide some context, that would be helpful.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think, the easiest way to think about it right now is the flattening out. So as we get a clearer picture on what the revenue profile looks like for '23, we'll -- I'll have a better level of sort of quarter-to-quarter guidance. We've invested a lot over the last couple of years to support the revenue growth and to continue to invest in driving innovation and differentiation, which is so critical to KLA's go-to-market, and so we've made those investments. We want to get returns on those investments. So we'll be careful and judicious about how we think about it. Obviously, the reality of the business environment is a factor, but also ensuring that we have the right products to meet our customers' road map requirements over the next few years is really critical. And I think the history at KLA has shown that in a soft period that our ability to invest and deliver what our customers need when they need it. It's been fundamental to our ability to go-to-market to have the portfolio and to share the value that we deliver. So it will be a balancing act across all of those kinds of dynamics. But I think from a modeling point of view, you've got a model that it flattens out. There's also inflation pressures, right? We'll have a merit cycle, so we'll have to work through all of that as well, but my expectation right now is that you'll -- we're tapping the breaks and you'll see it flatten out.
Operator: And we do have time for one final question. We will take our final question from Atif Malik with Citi.
Atif Malik: First, I just want to clarify if you and your peers cannot ship the spare parts and services to these projects, will these projects kind of like halt sometime next year as they run out of spare parts? And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: The ability to support the tools, I can't speak for the peers. But I can just say for KLA systems, given the nature of our tools and the maintenance that's required to support them and the supply chain, which is fairly custom, that the ability to do maintenance is important to keeping the tools up and performing as designed and expected. So without service, it becomes very hard to utilize the tools that we've shipped.
Atif Malik: Great. And then the team talked about very nice bookings momentum on auto-related products on advanced packaging and silicon carbide at the Investor Day. Can you update us what you're seeing in the auto market that end market seems to be holding quite well right now and into next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think in automotive, it's been a nice driver for our business, and we've seen meaningful growth really across not just what's gone on in our EPC group but also -- and you have exposure in a few different places, right? We have exposure in our SPTS business, which is for process in power and semiconductors but also in our Semi PC business. And so we have a few offerings that we tailored to support that market, and so we've seen nice growth there. And we're encouraged by the rising semiconductor content, just basic content in cars, let alone EUV enhanced content and assisted capabilities moving forward. So I don't have the exact number in terms of what it is. I want to say it's about $700 million or so this year in '22 in terms of what we'll call kind of auto exposure from a revenue point of view, and we would expect to see that grow over time. And we're engaging at levels with our customers that are driving a different way of thinking about Process Control, given the reliability requirements in auto and the margin structure, the cost of defectivity, the cost of recall and so on.
Kevin Kessel: All right. We thank you and we appreciate. Yes. Thanks so much for the questions, everyone. I appreciate your time on a busy earnings week, and we will be in touch. I'll turn the call back over to the operator to conclude.
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-07-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Leo, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q4 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter.  
 Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss our results released today after the market close. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. Whenever references are made to full year business performance, they are calendar year references.  
 A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  
 Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.  
 Our CEO, Rick Wallace will begin the call with some brief comments in our recent June quarter results before discussing our view of the semiconductor industry demand environment and then a few June quarter highlights. Bren Higgins, our CFO, will conclude with some additional financial highlights from the quarter as well as our outlook and guidance.  
 I'd like to now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin with a few comments about the quarter. First, KLA continues to benefit from multiple growth drivers reflected in our June quarter results. Specifically for this quarter, our revenue of $2.5 billion was at the top end of our guidance range and up 29% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.  
 GAAP EPS was $5.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.81, both at the top end of our guidance range. The talented global teams at KLA have remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and strategically navigating supply chain challenges. They are steadfast in their commitment to creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders.  
 Our teams continue to follow the KLA operating model as a guide to meet our challenges and benefit from the opportunities of an evolving market. Driving this performance, strong customer demand across major product groups, macroeconomic uncertainty and the resulting effects of consumer demand are areas we are monitoring closely.  
 Our customers have indicated some end markets, specifically PCs and mobile devices have softened over the past few months, and we have seen memory pricing in both segments weakened. While we have elevated concerns, we continue to see strong demand beyond our ability to supply from our customers with no material change in our shipment profile beyond the normal facility readiness issues and customers aligning tool deliveries with their production.  
 In assessing the full CY '22 WFE outlook, we have evaluated the persistent supply chain challenges and recently announced CapEx adjustment in the memory category. With this in mind, KLA's outlook for WFE growth in '22 has tempered. Bren will expand more on the details when he discusses the outlook.  
 We still see high single-digit WFE growth in calendar '22 and are confident in our ability to deliver relative WFE outperformance. We have supply chain challenges abate. This would be an additional upside. Process control is one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market. And as the market leader, KLA is in an inevitable position that fits the current demand landscape.  
 We see continued investment in technology at the leading edge and increased demand for legacy nodes. We also see growth in technology categories, including Advanced Packaging. These factors all support steady long-term growth for the WFE category.  
 We attribute KLA's consistent and strengthening market leadership to our focus on investing in innovation at a high level to drive differentiation through a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges.  
 Our technologies help our customers drive their growth strategy. I'd like to now briefly summarize a few quarterly highlights. First, KLA continues to drive strong relative outperformance versus peers. In foundry/logic, simultaneous investment across multiple nodes remain a tailwind. In memory, even with some customers' investment signaled to slow, demand diversification remains strong across multiple other industries.  
 Second, our Wafer Inspection business again delivered impressive results in the June quarter as revenues grew 20% sequentially and 49% year-over-year. Third, KLA delivered record quarterly revenue from our Electronics, Packaging and Components business in the June quarter. Fourth, the KLA Services business surpassed the $0.5 billion quarterly revenue level for the first time as revenue was $512 million, up 15% year-over-year.  
 Finally, the June quarter was another exceptional period from the perspective of free cash flow and capital returns. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, amounting to 23% (sic) [ 82% ] year-over-year growth. We also announced a $6 billion share repurchase program and a 24% increase in our quarterly dividend level. Additionally, we increased our long-term targeted capital returns to 85% of free cash flow.  
 We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders versus -- via our dividend and stock repurchase programs. Also, this quarter, we introduced our new long-term revenue growth targets and financial model for 2026 at our June 16, 2022 Investor Day in New York City.  
 KLA's new 9% to 11% revenue growth objective through '26 features strong relative growth in each of our major business lines over that period. Our long-term model assumes a baseline semiconductor industry growth CAGR of 6% to 7% through 2026, with many forecasts today for the semiconductor market to exceed $1 trillion by 2030.  
 In summary, KLA's June quarter results once again demonstrate sustainable outperformance. Our consistent execution against various challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of macroeconomic uncertainty and in addressing persistent supply chain issues, highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, the dedication of our global teams and our commitment to assertive capital allocation and delivering long-term value to our stakeholders.  
 Chief Financial Officer, Bren Higgins, will now go through our June quarter financial highlights and outlook. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. As Rick just said, KLA's June quarter results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. Revenue was near $2.5 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4% and non-GAAP diluted EPS and GAAP EPS were $5.81 and $5.40, respectively.  
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $514 million, below our expectation of $525 million, mostly due to the timing of new employees joining versus our plan. In addition, we also realized a cost benefit from the strong U.S. dollar impact resulting from our global footprint.  
 Total operating expenses comprised $297 million in R&D and $217 million in SG&A. Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect to continue our important investment in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the leverageable KLA operating model to facilitate growth.  
 Our investments include new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis. As a result, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $530 million in the September quarter and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to continue to trend higher over the balance of 2022 to support our sequential revenue growth expectations.  
 We will size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental non-GAAP operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon.  
 Non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 41.8%, almost 1 point higher than the guidance midpoint implied. Other income and expense, net, was $22 million, below guidance of $43 million, with the positive variance from guidance reflecting a gain on a strategic investment that was transacted in the quarter, offset by a recurring mark-to-market adjustment of a supply investment.  
 For the September quarter, we forecasted at approximately $75 million to reflect the impact of the new debt issuance. Quarterly effective tax rate was 14.8%, higher than the 13.5% guidance due principally to the equity market impact on deferred compensation programs. At the guided rate, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.09 higher at $5.90.  
 We continue to guide 13.5% as the long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $867 million. GAAP net income was $805 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million, and free cash flow was $746 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 86% and a free cash flow margin of 30%.  
 The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Moving to the balance sheet, where we saw a lot of activity this past quarter. KLA ended the quarter with $2.7 billion in total cash, debt of $6.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.
 In June, S&P upgraded KLA 1 notch to A-, citing improved scale and outlook for further profitable growth. Later in June, we issued $3 billion in new debt and announced the completion of a tender offer for $500 million of senior notes due 2024. These actions reinforce that KLA maintains active and diligent oversight of our cost of capital, an awareness of the impact on shareholder value of the appropriate capital structure for our business and productive capital allocation. 
 As demonstrated by the new calendar 2026 financial targets and the capital return actions announced at our recent Investor Day, KLA has confidence in our business over the long term and is committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns that includes both dividend growth and increasing share repurchases. Consistent with this, we increased our long-term capital returns target as mentioned earlier. 
 Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.5 billion to shareholders, including $4.9 billion in share repurchases and $639 million in dividends paid. Turning to our outlook. We have adjusted our overall WFE outlook for calendar '22 to reflect persistent supply chain challenges that are [ gating ] shipments and revenue recognition for many of our peers. 
 We now expect the WFE market to grow in the high single digits to approximately $95 billion in 2022, off a baseline of roughly $87 billion in calendar 2021. This outlook reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across customer segments. While we work hard to manage capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand. 
 While our supplier engagement strategy that we discussed at our Investor Day has been validated through this cycle, supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. As indicated in the last couple of quarters, we continue to expect sequential growth through this calendar year and expect KLA's total revenue growth to meet or exceed the low 20% range, with Semiconductor Process Control systems growing several points faster than the company average. 
 Finally, we expect demand to continue exceeding supply during the calendar year's second half. KLA is in a position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our Semi PC business, which should translate to strong relative growth overall. 
 Looking ahead, as indicated earlier, we're concerned with the macroeconomic environment and how it may affect the demand for our customers' products and their capacity plans as we move into calendar 2023. To date, the pressure from customers to deliver remains high and is driving our expectations for sequential growth through calendar 2022. 
 We're encouraged by the diversification and sustainability of our current demand profile and the company's operational execution. We are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support our customers' growing process control requirements, our near-term outlook and our long-term through-cycle growth thesis. 
 Our September quarter guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.6 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry/logic is forecasted to be approximately 64%, and memory is expected to be around 36% of Semi PC systems revenue. In memory, DRAM is expected to be about 40% of the segment mix and NAND, 60%. 
 We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 62% to 64%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $5.28 to $6.38 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.70 to $6.80. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 143 million shares. 
 In conclusion, despite the macro and supply chain headwinds, we see the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE as both durable and compelling over the long run. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remains important trends in our industry. 
 These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and the resumption of scaling reflects the value that semiconductors and our industry have in lowering our cost for our customers and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. 
 When it comes to KLA, considering our track record of execution and the power of our portfolio, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable outperformance throughout changing economic periods. As we look at the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, we continue to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook and maintain our product development investments to enable industry growth and support our customers' multiyear investment plans. This provides an element of stability that shores up our confidence in the demand outlook for the future. 
 These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, position us to continue outperforming our industry as we execute our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive [ moat ], industry-leading financial performance, long-standing track record of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. 
 That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. We are ready to queue for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Congratulations on the solid results and quarterly execution. You guys lead times are quite long, where you guys have good visibility into next year. And I think even into, in some cases, 2024, you highlighted some of the demand headwinds in your prepared remarks and also maybe some of the early signals from your customers on there's sort of conservative CapEx spending plans going forward. 
 I know you're not seeing anything meaningful in terms of near to midterm shipment plans, but given your customers are all booking into next year, have you guys seen any changes in longer-term orders as a result of your customers' increasingly negative views on demand for next year? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Harlan, thanks for the comments and the question. I would say that certainly in the near term, we've seen no changes from our customers. In fact, the pressure is as high today as it was 3 months ago. And our adjustments to the near-term WFE were really related to some of the challenges that a lot of our peer companies are facing in terms of their ability to either ship tools or recognize revenue, and that would have an impact on WFE given the expectations for the second half -- in terms of growth in the second half versus the first half. 
 It's too early for us to call '23. Certainly, we're monitoring what we see there. As we think about our planning and as we move into -- as we move outside of this year from -- at least from where we sit today, we see a sustainability in our output levels as we move into the first part of '23. 
 Now we'll have to watch and see what our customers end up doing and particularly some of the challenges in the memory space and what that might mean. But at least from where we sit today, we see no real churn in the backlog and in expectations in terms of delivery timing. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, even to add to that, Harlan, one of the things we have seen because obviously, we've been talking with customers recently and they're -- they know we're aware of some of the talk is that they're telling us basically 2 things. One, keep our slots. And two, if somebody else's spot opens up, could you please give it to us. So what we're seeing for process control feel like we're probably a little bit in a different position than the process players are. 
Harlan Sur: Great. And in the event of WFE decline next year, you've got several positive buffers, right? And I feel like one of the biggest ones is that your Services business historically does not decline during downturn. So like if I look back over the past 20 years, I think there's only been 1 year that your Services business has been down. And then more near term, I think over the past 4 downturns, the KLA team has actually grown its Services business in all 4 of those downturns. 
 So outside of the stable annuity-like subscription service contracts, and I know you guys talked about expansion on services opportunities on legacy nodes like -- what else has allowed the team to grow its Services business in periods where WFE spending is weak? And what's the historical track record on the EPC Services business during downturns? 
Richard Wallace: So kind of 2 questions you threw in the EPC, one at the end. Let me start with the process control one. Often what we've seen historically in downturn is customers still want to get productivity. And one of the ways they do that as they focus heavily on yield improvement and process stability. So we actually see utilization stay high on the services in order to keep the tools capable. And sometimes they'll actually deploy some of their limited budget toward upgrading the installed base. 
 In terms of EPC, obviously, we've not really been through a cycle with that. So it's a little bit secondhand knowledge. But it depends on the segment that they're in, in terms of -- but as you know, as a percent of our overall business, that will not change the dynamic that we see overall for our Services business -- should we hit some headwinds going into next year. 
Bren Higgins: The only other thing I'd add, Harlan, is that we're seeing investment across multiple nodes. And so from a leading edge point of view, certainly, the complexity of the tools that are going in to support those markets, the drivers of those markets particularly around data center and high-performance compute will drive our customers to -- given how they buy process control to want to keep these tools up and use them as they're trying to navigate through these technology transitions. 
 And so that's an important aspect of the value that we add. So even if they're pulling back on some of the capacity investments they might be making, they're still investing in R&D and ramping facilities. And the wafer start goals within a particular time frame may just change. 
 If you think about within memory or even within some of the trailing edge areas, those areas are areas where process control intensity tends to be a little bit lower. And so I think just in terms of how we see the investment play out, those are areas that we're less exposed [indiscernible] don't think that they would impact the business to the degree that they might impact other more capacity-centric players. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. 
Robert Mertens: This is Bob Mertens on for Krish. My first question was just around if you could provide any color on a potential impact to the business in terms of shipments to China, if there were any sort of restrictions what this might look like, whether [indiscernible] sub-14-nanometer shipments, just sort of how you're thinking about that? And then I have 1 follow-up. 
Bren Higgins: Well, specific to that question. And of course, there was some -- I know some of our peers have gotten this question as well. But we did receive a notification from the U.S. government about new licensing requirements for China related to sub-14-nanometer development and production. 
 Of course, we'll continue to engage with the government and have an active dialogue and we'll fully comply with all applicable laws in guidance here. I would say that given the lead time and timing unpredictability of new licenses, that this has no effect on our guidance for the upcoming quarter or our comments on the remainder of '22. 
 And I would say, as I look at the funnel over the next 12 months, given where investment is happening and what we expect, we don't see any material impact to our business from this new requirement. So I don't want to speculate on what else could happen. But based on what we know today and what we've been asked, that's mostly what I have to say about the topic. 
Robert Mertens: Okay. That's helpful. And then just real quick, have you provided in the past, the breakdown between domestic and international shipments to China? if I remember correctly, maybe you mentioned domestic customers were more skewed towards smaller foundry players. Is that a fair assumption? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. That's still true. The multinational activity in China is more mature. And so most of our business is in China, it tends to be native China as it relates to Semiconductor Process Control. So within Semiconductor Process Control systems, about 25% or so of our shipments are to China. 
 And now overall, for the whole company [indiscernible] service and you include other parts of the company and EPC and so on, you end up closer to -- in this last quarter, it was 29%. Most -- so most of the business is there and most of it is across multiple projects. There's a lot of projects. They tend to be more foundry/logic. You also have investment in infrastructure related to reticle infrastructure and wafer infrastructure. And so there's investments that are happening there, and we have products that serve those parts of the market as well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Quatrochi of Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: I was wondering if you -- Bren, if you go through kind of the puts and takes on gross margin this quarter and how we should think about cost pass-through this quarter and what's embedded in the guidance? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, it pretty much played out the way we expected. We had more EPC revenue quarter-to-quarter as we had a record quarter in EPC, and that was a little dilutive from a mix point of view. Certainly, the challenges related to supply chain and what that means in terms of factory efficiency is also a bit of a drag on our margins. But we had modeled that in for the most part. 
 And I think the guidance midpoint was 62.5%, and we were at 62.4%. So pretty much as we had expected. As we look at the September quarter, most of the growth is coming from our -- in fact, all the growth and then a little bit because I would expect EPC to be down some quarter-on-quarter, it is coming from Semi PC, it's a richer mix. 
 And so we'll see that go up about 50 basis points or so at the midpoint. We are seeing pressure from cost increase, both in terms of parts but also in terms of freight and logistics and I think that's taking away some of the -- what you would expect to see in terms of incremental leverage in an expanding revenue environment like we're in. So it's offsetting some of those benefits. But at the end of the day, we felt like we'd be operating somewhere around 63% through this year, and that's been the guidance I've been giving and we're, for the most part, in line with that. 
Joseph Quatrochi: That's very helpful. And then maybe I missed it, but what was the mix of DRAM versus NAND for this quarter? I know you did it for the September quarter guide. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. So 45% was memory, and the mix was 2/3 DRAM. 
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Ho of Stifel. 
J. Ho: Congrats on the nice quarter. Maybe first off, in terms of leading edge versus trailing edge foundry/logic, obviously, I think a lot of your leading edge customers are still powering through with their investment plan. It's more the question of timing of when they can get tools. 
 Can you characterize what you're seeing on the trailing edge given that there's a lot of noise around that. Have you seen any changes in that marketplace? Or are investment plans for that device marketplace still on track on a going-forward basis? 
Richard Wallace: Sure. And yes, you're right. The leading edge guys are continuing, and we don't expect -- in our conversations with them, we don't expect any change in that. In terms of the trailing edge, it's not really been a big part of our business. And as we look forward, we're still struggling with demand -- with supply for some of them. 
 And so actually, the conversations we've been having have been more about them asking if they could accelerate deliveries than changing the profile. So given the conversations we've had and their desire to upgrade their facilities, it's not really a change in our profile. It may soften, but it hasn't yet. And in fact, if anything, a comment I made earlier, people are asking if [ slots ] open up, could they get access to them, and that's really been more of the conversation that we've been having because some of the products that they need, especially in the trailing edge, tend to be [ BBP ] kind of oriented products where we have tremendous demand. 
Bren Higgins: And the other thing I would add is about 80% of the revenue tends to be leading edge. So where we are selling to the trailing edge do have customers that are strategically trying to in-source more, so they're making more investments and longer-term investments. 
 And as specifications for end products are changing that could change process control requirements. But generally, if they're just expanding capacity to run parts that they've been running for a long time that are just inflecting as a result of the strong demand environment, you don't see real significant changes in process control intensity. They just add their process control equipment as they're expanding the wafer starts in a particular facility. So that drives the process control intensity that's fairly light. 
 Now over time, I think what's happening in the end markets is creating some opportunities for us but it's less of an impact in terms of the financial or the revenue contribution from those customers to KLA. It's great revenue, and its profitable revenue given that we're selling older platforms or platforms that we've been able to extend into those markets. But the big driver for our business is much more around leading edge than what we're seeing in the trailing edge. 
J. Ho: Great. That's really helpful. And Bren, maybe as a quick follow-up question for you. You guys have done a really good job of managing through the supply chain issue that the industry and the ecosystem has seen. The costs are obviously elevated, whether it's freight and logistics, the movement of components and things of that nature. 
 How do you look at the cost environment over the next several quarters? Is this something that we're just going to have to assume at least through the rest of '22 and possibly into '23. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, it's a good question. And of course, everything is more expensive. And so we're seeing that flow through earlier than prior quarters, maybe the last quarter, the quarter before, I talked about this year, expecting to see 100 basis point kind of impact, 1 point or so from incremental cost increase. And if you add freight into it, it's probably a little bit higher than that. 
 And so we are seeing that [ play ] through. Generally, when prices go up, they don't necessarily go down. And so we're not really planning on it. And we'll have to -- as I said at Investor Day, there's work for us to do in terms of how we think about [indiscernible] this overall. 
 Our products, generally, we're a value sell and so we think about the returns our customers are getting from our products, and we try to share in the value of that return. And part of our new capability cadence in terms of how we offer that to the market, it's managing not only new capability from a competitive point of view is important to that, but also what it means to financial model in terms of an opportunity for us to reassess the cost situation in a particular tool and how cost of ownership plays out in terms of the improvements that we're offering and how we will share that. 
 So we're being opportunistic where we can. Certainly, we're not benefiting from the revenue expansion from a scale point of view. And so we're not giving discounts related purely to volume to the extent that we have in the past. And so we're resetting some of that with our customers. But in general, I think it's much more about the value offering and how things -- kind of how things are priced over time. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Atif Malik of Citi. 
Atif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: I had a question on CHIPS Act, and I understand it's early. It looks like equipment companies might be able to get money to expand manufacturing of equipment in the U.S. with priority going first 2 companies that already manufactured in the U.S., and I understand you guys have manufacturing both the inside the U.S. and outside. And how would this change, if at all, your long-term manufacturing strategy? 
Richard Wallace: Thanks for the question. It doesn't really change our strategy. We're not going to make decisions based on that. We're going to make decisions as we always have, based on where it makes the most sense for us to build the products to support our customers where we can get the talent and where we can have the supply chains that we need. So it will not impact our decision making. 
Bren Higgins: You also [indiscernible] that we're fairly asset-light. So to the extent that we're building or expanding our facilities anywhere, it's really about space more than anything and some equipment. So it isn't -- it's very [indiscernible] our customers in terms of significant billions of dollars investment in a production facility. 
 So to Rick's point, it's much more about the operational motives that we have in terms of why we build, what we build, where. And incentives, whether they come in the form of grants, they come in the form of taxes or secondary. Obviously, we always optimize for wherever we are, but the primary motive is very operational for us. 
Atif Malik;Citi Investment Research (US);Analyst: Great. As my follow-up, Bren, 19 years ago, you were talking about EPC systems growing 20% for the year, and I understand June was a record quarter. Are you still looking at 20% growth for the EPC systems for the full year? And how are you -- what are you seeing in the mobile segment versus the auto segment of that end market? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. That's a great question. Auto is -- continues to be strong, auto and power, but we have seen some pressure, particularly in the PCB part of the business, driven by the softness in the mobile market. 
 I would expect EPC systems to be in the mid-teens in terms of growth this year, a little bit stronger in the second half versus the first half just as the whole company is a little bit stronger. But yes, it's mostly been -- we've seen strength and improvement in SPTS, or Specialty Semiconductor given its exposure to automotive and power, but we've seen some softness on the PCB side. So net-net, still nice growth, mid-teens growth, but not 20%. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our final question from Vedvati Shrotre of Jefferies. 
Vedvati Shrotre: I just wanted to go back on something that was asked earlier. So you mentioned that your customers are sort of looking for slots in case any opens up. So can you help me understand how that works. So if you get a push out from your customer, does that mean that slot is sort of close and the customer has to go back in the line. Is that a right interpretation? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. So I think our customers have the same kind of question you do. It doesn't really work that way. I mean, what they really want to do is move up the priority list. But as we keep explaining to them, we have far more demand than we have supply. And while we're working hard to expand it. So it's just the question of can we get things done sooner? 
 And that's really what they're asking is can you tell? But my point is that is for many customers, the way they're approaching this, they're hopeful that this will give them a chance to get some of the products that are pretty far out in delivery. That's kind of the way to think about it. It's not really exactly the same. We do have allocations for people, but there just aren't no free slots. 
 So if somebody were to drop out of the queue, the next person would just move up in terms of is the way that would work. So it's not -- people aren't going to jump ahead in the line. 
Vedvati Shrotre: Right. And so if I understand correctly, so if -- in case if there is a pushout and not a cancellation, does that necessarily open up a slot or a push out can be different from...? 
Bren Higgins: So if somebody had a December slot right now, and they said, we don't need that until June. The next person in line in December would get that slot, and they would be fit in somewhere in June. And they're likely our customers that have slots in June that would love to have a slot in December. 
 So given the lead times on some of our products. So that's the natural churn we see. And a lot of it is tied to sometimes facilities and facility readiness. It also can be tied to whether they receive certain tools from other customers as they're setting up -- or other suppliers as they're setting up their production lines. 
 So you always see a little bit of movement like that. But to Rick's point, we're underserving the level of demand we have. And so customers are having to get in line a long way out in a lot of cases. And so the ability to satisfy that demand earlier would be an opportunity for a lot of our customers that they would certainly want to take advantage of given the strength of the demand that they have seen, but also their desire for these products and our constraints around them. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We know how busy of a day it is today in terms of earnings. So I appreciate your time and interest. With that, I will turn the call back over to Leo to close it. 
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation June Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Richard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin.
 Before getting into KLA's results in more detail, I want to acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. Their perseverance and drive to be better remains at the center of our consistent execution and outperformance. You have remained focused despite challenging macro and supply chain conditions as our high-performing teams that drove KLAs indispensability to customers, resulting in additional process control market share growth for the recently ended year. 
 KLA's March quarter results demonstrate strong execution across multiple areas of our business in a persistently challenging supply chain environment, delivering revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share above the midpoint of the guidance ranges for the quarter.  
 We once again displayed strong execution across multiple areas of our business. Our focus on consistently meeting commitments and delivering on our long-term strategic objectives and financial targets is the hallmark for which KLA is known and the standard by which we measure our success. 
 Customer demand across major product groups continues to build as secular trends drive broad-based growth across a range of markets and applications served by the semiconductor industry. This robust demand has been putting pressure on the industry's ability to supply semiconductors.  
 Simultaneously, our leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to improve their competitive positioning while addressing growth in markets that demand new leading-edge semiconductor capabilities. Against this rising demand backdrop, KLA has remained focused on responding to evolving customer needs and navigating supply chain challenges. 
 Very important that KLA continues to operate with purpose and precision so we can create value for our customers, partners and shareholders by outperforming expectations. Our talented global teams both run and improve the KLA operating model and use it as a critical guide to rise to the challenges and opportunities of the evolving marketplace.  
 The market leader in process control, one of the fastest-growing segments of the overall WFE market, KLA remains in a position of strength when we look at the industry demand landscape. Semiconductor industry has evolved to be more significantly strategic and has an increasingly less cyclical end-market mix, with many fundamental drivers advancing the critical nature of semiconductors throughout the global economy.  
 Factors such as the continuing advancement of technology at the leading edge, increasing investment in legacy nodes, and innovation and growth of new enabling technologies such as advanced packaging, are fueling long-term growth for the semiconductor industry and for equipment and capabilities that make it possible.  
 Despite persistent supply challenges and macro headwinds, our outlook for the WFE industry this year remains intact, albeit with an expectation for a stronger second half than anticipated in January. We expect WFE demand to top $100 billion this calendar year, making it the third consecutive year of double-digit growth.  
 KLA's expected growth in calendar 2022 will mark the seventh consecutive year of growth. This sustained strength in customer demand is happening in an environment of increasing momentum for process control where KLA's market leadership has strengthened further, and our market share results remain 4x our nearest competitor.  
 KLA's expanding lead is the result of our #1 market position in some of the fastest-growing segments in WFE that have a market size greater than $1 billion in terms of annual revenue. We attribute KLA's strengthening market leadership to our ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategies, including investing at a high level to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products and technologies that address the most critical process control challenges in the marketplace and help our customers drive their growth strategy.
 We're pleased to see the success of our strategies validated by our customers' purchasing decisions and reflected in the April 2022 Gartner market share report, showing KLA's market leadership advancement. This emphasizes the power of the portfolio strategy we employ. 
 The recently published Gartner market share report shows process control was one of the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, growing 43% in the year to $10.4 billion. KLA's share of process control grew approximately 1 percentage point to over 54% and has increased over 3 percentage points since 2018 and remains greater than 4x our nearest competitor across all regions.
 Within process control, the optical inspection market grew to approximately $2.5 billion in annual sales, outpacing WFE by 40%, and our share of this market remained above 80%. Other highlights demonstrate the power of KLA's portfolio strategy in delivering strong growth in other critical process control markets, including metrology, macro inspection and very strong growth in e-beam review. 
 Turning now to the top 5 highlights for the March 2022 quarter. First, KLA's market leadership in some of the most critical and fastest-growing markets in WFE continues to fuel growth. We remain nimble and innovative in addressing global supply challenges to meet customer requirements and our financial targets.
 Foundry and Logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity remain a tailwind. In memory, demand is broad-based across multiple customers.
 Second, our optical metrology business stood out in the March quarter, driven by KLA's market leadership and increasing customer adoption of market applications and leading-edge technology development and capacity monitoring. Optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and critical next-generation architectures, including gate-all-around and multi-stack 160-plus layer 3D NAND. This was further illustrated in the new Gartner market share report, which showed 50% growth in 2021.  
 Third, KLA is intensifying our efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolio of both the SPC and EPC groups. KLA is broadening our product portfolio and delivering a comprehensive suite of products and technologies that include wafer-level packaging and final assembly and test products for advanced packaging markets, and a portfolio of inspection systems and process tools designed to help customers achieve their 0 defect goals.  
 These collaborations continue to grow with KLA recording our highest-ever customer engagement in terms of wafer inspection revenue for automotive applications in the March quarter.  
 Fourth, services revenue was $488 million, up 14% year-over-year. The company tallied a record 349 installs in the March quarter, well above the previous high of 293. This was a remarkable achievement given travel restrictions in Asia, lockdowns related to COVID-19 and complexities related to the supply -- current supply environment.  
 Service revenue is consistently outperforming the 9% to 11% long-term growth target, driven by growing installed base, increasing customer adoption of long-term service agreements, higher utilization rates, and expansion of service opportunities in the legacy nodes.  
 Finally, the March quarter was another exceptional period from a free cash flow perspective. We generated quarterly free cash flow of $719 million for 23% year-over-year growth. We've also remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase programs, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including a $565 million in quarterly share repurchases and an additional $159 million in dividends in the March quarter.  
 Before passing the call over to Bren to review the financial highlights and guidance, let me summarize briefly. KLA's March quarter demonstrates sustained outperformance, highlighting the critical nature of KLA's products and services and enabling the digital transformation of our lives. Our consistent strong execution against significant challenges in the marketplace, both in terms of meeting rising demand and addressing persistent supply issues highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation.
 KLA is exceptionally positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we continue to see more customer interest driven by technology change than ever before at the leading edge.  
 Simultaneously, the need for increasing performance and reliability requirements for legacy nodes to support evolving markets like automotive and 5G are also important to help deliver new capabilities. We believe KLA will continue to benefit from numerous secular growth factors that drive long-term industry demand. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide durable free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders.  
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren. 
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. 
 Our results reinforce the success of our execution and strong market position. We continue to focus on meeting customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, increasing gross and operating profit, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation.  
 Quarterly revenue was $2.289 billion at the upper end of the guided range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was above the midpoint of guidance at 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected semiconductor process control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter.  
 Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.13, also towards the upper end of the guided range of $4.35 to $5.25. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.83. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $484 million, below our expectation of $495 million, mostly due to the pace of new hiring, which was slower than originally planned. Total operating expenses were comprised of $285 million in R&D and $199 million in SG&A.  
 Given the strong demand backdrop, rapid expansion of our business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect to continue to invest in our global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model to facilitate growth. This includes investing in new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion as we position the company to execute against our long-term structural growth thesis.
 Furthermore, we, as most companies, are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and adjustments related to our annual merit process that went into effect during March. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow to approximately $525 million in the June quarter, and we forecast quarterly operating expenses to trend higher over the balance of 2022, along with our sequential revenue growth expectations. 
 We continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over our normalized time horizon.
 Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was once again strong at 41.7% in the March quarter. Other income and expense net was $46 million compared with guidance of $41 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the mark-to-market impact of a strategic supply investment.
 For the June quarter, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $43 million. The quarterly effective tax rate was 14.6%, above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per share at the guided tax rate would have been $5.20. Non-GAAP net income was $776 million. GAAP net income was $731 million. Cash flow from operations was $819 million. And free cash flow was $719 million, resulting in free cash flow conversion of 93% and free cash flow margin of 31.4%.
 Looking at revenue by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.98 billion, up 31% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially, as expected. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix for foundry logic customers was approximately 63%. Memory was approximately 37%, with a further breakdown comprised of 26% from DRAM customers and 11% from NAND.  
 Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in automotive, 5G and advanced packaging. Within EPC, the specialty semiconductor process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated revenue of $117 million, up 28% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $193 million, down 6% year-over-year and up 2% on a sequential basis. 
 For an additional breakdown of revenue by major products in region, please see the shareholder letter and slides.  
 In terms of the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in total cash, debt of $3.7 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We have growing confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a consistent strategy of cash returns to shareholders that enables growing dividends and increased share repurchases.  
 Over the long term, we target returning at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our capital return strategy underscores our strong record of predictable and productive capital deployment and remains an important differentiating element of the KLA investment thesis. 
 Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $620 million in dividends paid. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and a strong free cash flow margin across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions.  
 Turning to the outlook. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook for calendar '22 remains unchanged. We expect the WFE market to grow in the mid-teens to over $100 billion in 2022, off a higher base of approximately $87 billion in calendar '21 after assessing reported results for the December quarter.  
 Although based on pure company March reporting, it appears that industry supply issues will increase the loading in the second half of the year. This reflects the continued broad-based strength of demand across all customer segments. While we add capacity at KLA and with our suppliers, supply chain shortages continue to constrain our ability to meet customer demand.
 In addition, the duration and potential expansion of COVID-19-related lockdowns in China are unknown and could adversely impact some suppliers with operations in the affected areas. Furthermore, these lockdowns could delay systems installations and customer acceptance processes due to resource mobility restrictions in the country. In short, the situation is fluid and will be monitored closely.
 Supplier visibility remains challenging and has not improved over the past 3 months. We still expect to see quarterly sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2022 and overall revenue growth for the calendar year to exceed 20%. In addition, we believe that demand will continue to exceed supply through the remainder of the calendar year. KLA is in position to deliver another year of sustainable outperformance in our semiconductor process control business and strong relative growth overall. 
 Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile. Our bookings momentum and strong backlog positions us to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are strategically adding capacity across our global manufacturing footprint to support this outlook and our customers' growing process control requirements.
 Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.425 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 56%, and memory is expected to be approximately 44% of semiconductor process control systems revenue.
 Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 66% of the segment and NAND is forecasted to be about 34%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as we expect sequential growth in EPC revenue in the quarter and a slightly weaker product mix within semi process control to dilute margins modestly versus the March quarter.
 Longer term, infrastructure investments, labor cost inflation, supply chain strain and rising global logistics costs are surpassing the benefits of economies of scale normally seen in a rising revenue environment. Given expectations for revenue for the year, we continue to expect that calendar '22 gross margins will be in a range of 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points.
 Other model assumptions for the June quarter include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $525 million, other income and expense net of approximately $43 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $4.60 to $5.70. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.93 to $6.03. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 150 million shares.
 In closing, the secular trends driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE are compelling despite the current macroeconomic headwinds. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. 
 We have confidence in the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and bookings visibility, which motivates us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future.
 KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, reliable operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to shareholders.
 And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. 
 David, please queue for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Great job on the solid execution. 
 As you guys pointed out, the market share numbers are out for last year. You grew your process control market share to almost 55% or well over 4x larger than your nearest competitor.
 I was looking at the data. So in the 7 major categories under process control, you have the #1 market share position in 5 of the 7 categories. And the categories where you guys actually grew 50% -- more than 50% were pattern wafer inspection, overlay and metrology, macro inspection and review and classification. 
 Obviously, all of these are very critical solutions for next-generation manufacturing technologies. So on the strong growth outlook for this year, what areas or segments do you anticipate driving the outperformance and maybe even further share gains in your process control franchise for this year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Harlan, I'll go ahead and start and let Rick add if he needs to here. But it was a very strong year, obviously, for the company. And we're really pleased with the share results. 
 One of the things as we look at just our expectation this year is we expect to see continued momentum in a lot of the markets that you referenced, so there's certainly strength that's expected there. We're expecting greater than market growth out of our reticle inspection business, which was a little slower than market last year, and it tends to be a lumpier business. But as we move into this year, it should be a little bit stronger.
 So overall, we feel pretty good about the road map across our products. As we said in the prepared remarks, our biggest challenge is just getting the parts we need to meet the very strong customer demand that's out there.
 But we're encouraged by the momentum we have, and our internal plan is to continue to gain share. We think there's more opportunity for us given what you said in terms of where we are. We go linearly, but at the same time, we've had a nice trajectory over the last few years and would expect to see it grow as we move forward. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Just to add a couple of things, Harlan. One is, of course, Gartner's data is revenue and the bookings picture is even stronger. So we're in really good shape in terms of that.
 We've talked about the backlog and the demand that we have. So we'll continue to see share gain in terms of -- or strength of share in the segments that you outlined. Also, the new technologies that are coming offer more process control intensity opportunities.  
 For example, high-k/metal gate, if you look at that, if you look at gate-all-around, the metrology, bigger die size, all those things are going to allow -- there would be more opportunity. And we have products in the queue as well as in the field that are going to take advantage of that. So we feel very well positioned.  
 The biggest challenges we've talked about is satisfying demand, and that's related to -- we think we've done a really good job with supply chain, but there's more work to do there to continue to support our customers. 
Harlan Sur: I appreciate the insights there. And then on your EPC franchise, specialty semiconductor, manufacturing, packaging, PCB, display franchises. It's been a great diversification for the KLA business. And I know, going back -- and you guys will probably update us, but going back to the last Analyst Day, the team's outlook for EPC was to grow that business at a 9% to 10% CAGR. You grew that business -- and this includes services, you grew that business about 15% last year. The 2-year CAGR up to last year has been about 12%.
 So tracking ahead of your targets, what type of growth do you guys expect for EPC this calendar year, just given the strong focus by your semi customers on power, RF, sensors, advanced packaging and new PCB architectures? And maybe that's been slightly offset by smartphone and display weakness, but wanted to get your views on EPC growth for this year. 
Richard Wallace: Yes, Harlan. So in terms of the systems part of EPC, we're somewhere close to 20% is our expectation for the year. Obviously, we'll have to see how that plays out. That tends to be a little bit of a shorter lead time business and have some parts of its markets that are a little bit more sensitive to some of the consumer dynamics.
 But in general, we expect to see about a 20% growth there. Now if you blend it with its service business, it will be in the high teens. That service business tends to grow a little bit slower than that.  
 But you're right, over the last couple of years, on the systems side, we've been in that 20% range. And it hasn't gotten as much of a play as -- given the strength of our semi process control business. But we're pleased with where we're going directionally there. And we'll have more to say about the longer-term view at our Investor Day in mid-June. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, can you speak to your backlog? What your blended kind of lead times look like today? And what kind of visibility that provides you into 2023? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, C.J, it's a great question. Right now, blended lead times, and they're blended across right products and the revenue value of the composition of the backlog, but it's well over a year now in terms of where lead times are. Obviously, certain product lines are longer than that. We're slotting certain product lines now today out into 2024. So there's quite a bit of demand for some of the products.
 And given the constraints we have around key components and the lead time for those components, it just pushes that -- those lead times out. So overall, we've seen it trend up here. And as I said in the prepared remarks, as we go through the year, I continue to expect to see demand exceeding supply. So I would expect lead times to probably increase a little bit as we move over the course of the year. 
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. As my follow-up. Curious, on the China lockdowns, any impact or future impact in your view, particularly around kind of PCB and display area? I would imagine that might be a downstream potential risk in terms of taking deliveries. 
Richard Wallace: Well, our guidance implies a risk-adjusted assessment of where we're at. Obviously, there's always some unknowns about that, both from a supply point of view, which we feel pretty good about, but also more so from just can we get access to customers, can we get tools installed, can we get acceptances done and so on.
 We've contemplated that in the guidance we've given. We do have an expectation of seeing some opening begin in the, call it, sort of the middle of May. If things drift out further than that or there's a significant expansion of lockdown activity, it could have more of an impact. 
 But we -- I think we've risk-adjusted it as best as we can. There's certainly some unknowns. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I wanted to try to probe a little bit on that question around backlog because backlog really doesn't mean a whole lot when your lead times are sitting beyond that 12-month window for backlog.
 So I guess the question is more on purchase obligations. I think you report that in the Q, and it was greater than $8 billion, I think, exiting December. And so I guess the first question is sort of where does that stand now? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of how long book-to-bill is going to stay above 1. And maybe if you could give us backlog, a number. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So Tim, you'll see the exact number in the 10-Q that we file. And it's the performance obligations, not purchase commitments. But anyway, the performance obligations, where you're right, we're over $8 billion last quarter and we'll be in excess of $10 billion this quarter. And to my earlier comment, I think we'll see book-to-bill above 1 through the year. 
Timothy Arcuri: I guess I had a question also on process control systems. So March came in like almost $100 million better than what I had and what I think your sort of guidance was implying. June is about in line. I think before, you were talking about the second half of the year, process control systems being up sort of low to mid-teens. And I guess the question within that is, is that still the right number even though March came in a bit better? And part of that is a question really on timing because the films guys, as you said, they're having problems shipping tools. And so that is tending to push some WFE from the first half into the back half. 
 And I guess the question is, since you guys are sort of up-siding shipments and they're sort of down-siding shipments, does it become a problem for you, where you have like timing mismatches and maybe -- because they can't get film tools, maybe they start to push out your tools? 
Bren Higgins: Tim, usually, that doesn't impact us all that much because we tend to see process control tools go in early. Also, given the demand environment, customers will deal with timing issues in terms of taking tools and storing them to align with expectations around their other tool sets.  
 So I'm less concerned about that given that the strength of demand. Customers are beating on us every day to ship sooner, so I'm not I'm not concerned about delays in other types of tools impacting our products.  
 And you're right, we did have -- Q1 was stronger. Certainly the execution by the teams in the last month as we dealt with a lot of delays in parts, particularly around automation for our systems, the execution was really solid. And we're really pleased with the upside we saw in Q1.
 So as I think about the second half, the second half, I'm still in the same range, low to mid-teens in terms of semiconductor process control systems. So half to half versus the first half. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: I was curious, how should we think about the -- you mentioned slower-than-planned or hiring in a difficult labor environment? I assume that's more maybe geared towards 2023. Or how do we think about that in terms of your ability to have enough labor to meet demand for this year? 
Richard Wallace: Joe, it's Rick. It wasn't really -- it was much more about the impact to cost about when they're hired. We actually did quite well of hiring in Q1. It's just if they're not hired at the beginning of the quarter and we factored in the payroll for the whole quarter, we're on track for our hiring this year. 
 And most of that had to do, frankly, more with some of the engineering work than it does the work that's associated with both operations and service, where you could potentially, if you didn't have the resources, see a shortfall for the year.  
 But even then, it would just -- right now, we're trying to alleviate the teams who are doing a lot of overtime and trying to provide them some backfill. So none of our hiring challenges are affecting our ability to support the revenue for this year or next year. But we do want to get people in, and we've had good success, but it's more -- we're talking months as opposed to quarters or years behind. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could talk about the strength you saw in DRAM during the quarter? And I think you even implied in the guide, I think we're at record levels for process control systems. Just kind of curious what drove that, if it's architectural changes, EUV? Anything like that would be helpful. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Joe, it's mostly technology transitions this year. And certainly, the introduction of EUV and DRAM has been a driver for investment from our customers. It's pretty broad. As I look at the DRAM investment, it's pretty broad-based across our customer set. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. 
J. Ho: Maybe first off for you, Rick. In terms of the advanced packaging market, you've done a great job in terms of getting the value proposition for front-end chipmakers with your process control solutions.
 Now some of these customers are the same ones on the advanced packaging side. Some of them obviously are OSAT and customers like that. As advanced packaging becomes a much more complex problem, how do you get the customer mindset changed to get that same value proposition for those type of processes given the complexities that are occurring? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, good question, and one that -- obviously, we're excited about the EPC acquisition for exactly this. So I would say really, for EPC, even in earlier question we had about how we're doing and how we think about it, I really think of it in 3 stages. The first stage for EPC for KLA was to employ the operating model and how we run the businesses, and that was really what we did initially.  
 The second stage was customer engagement. And because, as you say, some of these customers are bigger customers, have more complex problems. And they know KLA, they wanted to engage with us. So that's actually been going quite well, and we've been having a lot of discussions.  
 But of course, then you get to the third part of that, which is technology leverage from the rest of KLA into EPC. And we're kind of in Phase 2 and Phase 3 now where we've been having those meetings. There are a lot of clear opportunities for us, and we're developing those solutions and rolling those out.
 So I think that you'll see the leverage, the revenue synergy associated from the additional channel access and the needs and then the benefit of our technology as we go forward. That's really -- that's coming. We're going to talk more about that at the Analyst Day in June as we roll that out. But right now, huge opportunities, and we feel like we're just at time with that acquisition to be in a position to support them. 
J. Ho: Great. As my follow-up maybe for Bren. Given WFE, the outlook looks like it's going to be a much more second half-weighted year, particularly in terms of revenues and when the equipment companies receive cash.
 You guys have been executing well, getting tools out on time. But we've heard from other companies where they're "shipping incomplete tools", where they'll finish the install and get the revenue recognition later on, so to not expect a huge "shipment ramp" or a huge production ramp the second half of the year. 
 How are you balancing those dynamics? Are you shipping any incomplete tools at the customer site where you can then go back later on so it doesn't overly imbalance both shipments as well as your revenue recognition? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Patrick, that's a great question. And when you're talking about process tools, you have modular systems. And so they kind of come together at the customer site in a lot of cases between the automation and then the gas boxes and the process chambers. And so if you're missing parts, sometimes, you have that issue. 
 With our systems, and we internally source the handlers for our systems. But our systems ship completely, and so they don't come -- for the most part. I mean, we might have an issue here or there on the FPD business, where you'll have a similar dynamic. And in some cases, there isn't a reasonable carve-out based on the substance of the transaction where you defer some of the revenue. But it's a very, very small part of KLA.
 So on our semi process control part of the business, we're shipping complete systems. And so you wouldn't see a big correction in a deferred revenue that all of a sudden comes together as you move forward. So what we're shipping is complete systems, and that's what's revenue-ing as we go forward. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vedvati Shrotre with Jefferies. 
Vedvati Shrotre: I think my first question is I wanted to understand if you have a sense of what the industry wafer capacity is expected to grow in this year and for the next year. 
 So WFE is expected to be around the mid-teens growth for this year. Like how does that translate to an increased capacity? If you can provide any color here. And I understand if you don't have an industry view, maybe you could talk to a subset of your customers, that would be helpful. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So at least $100 billion in WFE. It's translating. And I don't have the exact numbers, but we're seeing new wafer starts per month being added across all production nodes. And you're seeing it in memory at a limited level, certainly this year compared to prior years, less because it's more of a technology transition-focused year. 
 But certainly, on the foundry logic side, you're seeing increases in the 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer. And 7- and 10-nanometer is probably flattish, but then you get 28 and 40 and above and sort of those nodes. You've got the legacy investment that's happening there. So you're really seeing wafer start additions across just about all production nodes. 
Vedvati Shrotre: So is that in line with WSE growth? That's what I was trying to get at. Or is it -- so is that like an 18% increase? Or if you could help me characterize what kind of capacity increase that is. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, I don't think I can help you with that right now. By node, the capital intensity changes. And so it's not dollar for dollar in terms of how it applies to wafer starts at a given node. 
Vedvati Shrotre: Got it. Okay. Okay. And for my follow-up. Four to 5 years ago, most of the customers used to talk about reusing about 70% to 80% of their tools. How has this changed now? Is this -- is majority of the WFE spend on capacity additions? Like how has that changed since, if you could help me understand. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. That's an interesting change in the dynamics of the industry. And that was really more isolated to one period in time than if you look at the overall history of the industry. And that was largely because there were not very many new starts on advanced nodes. There were primarily just a handful of customers, a handful of devices.
 And so that reuse was something that happened when Moore's Law wasn't scaling. We're seeing very little reuse now, and there's a couple of reasons for that. One of the primary reasons is the number of starts, the broad-based number of devices that's being run on these nodes and the ability of more and more customers to support that. That means that our customers are running flat out those technology nodes as they're introducing new ones. 
 So we're actually seeing kind of the opposite effect, if you will. We're seeing some capacity. Some of our sales are actually into ramps that historically we would have considered to be done. And they're actually buying tools, for example, for 7-nanometer right now. There's still some of that going on in spite of the new investment being advanced. 
 So reuse is significantly down in terms of the amount. And that's a trend that our customers believe is going to continue is that it's going to be a focus on supporting that. And if you look at the overall semiconductor shortage in the world, you can imagine that, that's not something that they can really afford to do because they're running those old lines flat out, and we see that in our service business and the overall fabulization around the world. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen. 
Robert Mertens: This is Rob Mertens on behalf of Krish. 
 I guess, looking into the services, you've been growing the business nicely. You mentioned a strong installed base component in the quarter and just in general. But looking at the attach rate opportunity, I think you've mentioned maybe over 75% process control systems and maybe 90% in PCB. Is that a fair assessment? And is there further room to growth in terms of that side of the service business? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Look, certainly, as the tools increase in complexity and the demand on uptime increases, it does create opportunities for us to drive a contract model, a subscription-like model with those customers. 
 And so we do think there's some upside potential over time, and we'll talk a little bit about some of the longer-term drivers of our service business and its trajectory going forward at our Investor Day in June. 
 But obviously, PCB at closer to 90%, it's hard to improve much on that, but I think that there's still some opportunity on the semi PC side given the dynamics I mentioned. 
 One of the other opportunities we have in our acquired businesses is to try to drive more and higher attach on those tools in terms of service. And certainly, smaller players have a harder time having the infrastructure to be able to engage with customers to try to monetize that service business.
 And so there's opportunities for us in our specialty semiconductor business, our flat panel business and some other smaller acquisitions we've done to drive more service opportunity. We'll have a lot more to say about it in June, but hopefully, that helps for now. 
Robert Mertens: Great. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the WFE view you gave and sort of peers are indicating, would assume that supply issues are going to sort of ease in the second half. What sort of incremental challenges have you seen within the industry over the past couple of months? Are there any sort of specific shortages, key components? Or is it sort of an ongoing rolling issue where things pop up and are dealt with and then other things pop up? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I think the whack-a-mole analogy is applicable here. It seems that as we work certain issues, other issues materialize. The dynamic in China with the COVID lockdowns does have some potential impact on some suppliers. Although we think we've dealt with it in the guidance we've given in terms of just our assessment of the risk profile of that. But I would say they're all the same issues, and we just continue to work, and the teams have done a really good job with it. 
Operator: We will take our next question from Atif Malik with Citi. 
Atif Malik: First one for, maybe, Rick. If you can update us on your single beam eSL10 platform in terms of design wins and sales expectations this year. And the reason I asked that question is because we were at SPIE conference this year, and it appears that the multi-e-beam platforms are showing limited flexibility and gaps to HVM manufacturing at logic makers like Intel. And then I have a follow-up. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I guess the landscape, let me just generalize and I would say the e-beam inspection landscape has not really dramatically shifted. We've had some success, as we indicated, with the eSL10. But if you back up and look more about the overall balance between optical and e-beam for inspection, it's continuing remarkably to be at about that 80/20 split from optical to e-beam. It's been true for over the years. 
 So there are more e-beam applications, I think, that are showing up. The one -- for inspection, for example, that's showing up that we're participating in uniquely is for reticle inspection. And that's what we're doing with our new 8xx to address the -- some of the opportunities in EUV. 
 But not really a lot has changed. I mean we go back and forth with the latest introductions from e-beam inspection. But by and large, we've had some success, but the market is on a relative basis -- overall, the EV market is about 20% to the 80% that is optical inspection. 
 Bren, anything to add? 
Bren Higgins: No, I think they're complementary technologies and scaling into production is the challenge, as you mentioned. And even as you increase the beams, it doesn't necessarily equate to a lot of throughput. It does equate to some, but there is still a challenge and the throughput disparity is quite significant relative to optical solutions.
 So it's relegated to defect discovery and engineering analysis-type cases and doesn't -- isn't all that applicable to a production environment. And that's -- I think it's been very well validated, I think, with the strength that we've seen in optical pattern inspection over the last few years. 
Richard Wallace: Just one more example. I think this is important to understand. If you look at calendar 2021, our Gen 4 optical actually outsold our Gen 5 optical in terms of amount of revenue in that split of the 80% of the market, and then the rest was divided in the e-beam among the different e-beam players. 
 So this idea that the latest technologies would require e-beam inspection hasn't been proven. In fact, if anything, it shows the extendibility of optical as we -- even in 2021 and what we're seeing in 2022. In fact, we expect the Gen 4 to continue to have significant success in terms of serving the overall inspection needs. 
 So the view is they'll be complementary. e-beam will primarily be a tool that will be used for engineering analysis but not for in-line inspection. 
Atif Malik: Great. And then my follow-up, Bren. Is it possible to break out the leading-edge sales, let's say, 10-nanometer or below, within your foundry logic sales? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, it's about 80% is leading edge. Yes, that might include 14, 16, but that's only a few percent. So it's safe to say that pretty much 80% or so is 10-nanometer and below. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Weston Twigg with Piper Sandler. 
Weston Twigg: I just wanted to follow up on your comments about reticle outgrowing the market this year. Can you just let us -- help us understand why it undergrew a little bit last year? Was it customer mix? Or is it just lumpiness? And what makes you confident that you get faster than market growth this year? 
Bren Higgins: Well, yes, last year, it was a very strong 2020 and then 2021 was below market growth. It was still an up year for the business but below the market. And then we do have more strength this year. It tends to be lumpy. 
 If you're thinking about mass shop systems, so our Teron systems that we sell into the mass shop, those are very high-dollar -- revenue dollar tool. So the ASP is quite high. So they tend to skew the numbers a bit in that market given that. 
 But certainly, we're seeing strength both in terms of EUV and new layers given the strength of foundry and logic, and that drives more reticle sets. And you've got, obviously, a lot of new designs, but you have re-spins of older designs. And so that's driving a lot of reticle demand. That's probably the biggest driver. 
 You have also applications that are in the wafer fab for contamination monitoring. And we would also expect to see some revenue this year from the e-beam system that Rick mentioned as we get to the end of the year. 
 So I think it's those factors that are driving that. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Wes, I would add one thing to it also is we're talking about the reticle inspector. But if you look at the application itself of qualifying reticles, a lot of the success we had in 2021 and continue to have now is use of Gen 5 to qualify EUV reticles. 
 So while it may not be the rapid systems we're selling, it's the application in support of those, largely because that is the most effective way to determine the quality of those reticles is to actually inspect them. 
 And finally, we have the capability to do it on the wafers with Gen 5. And so we saw a huge push from customers, multiple customers, everyone who's essentially doing EUV to utilize Gen 5 to qualify those reticles. 
Weston Twigg: Okay. That's helpful. And that actually leads to a follow-on question. Just as high NAV comes down the pipeline over the next 2 or 3 years, do you have a solution ready for that, maybe leveraging your optical inspection platform? Or do you have to develop something novel? 
Richard Wallace: We have continued evolution of the platforms to support it. And we continue to work on additional reticle capabilities to support it. So I think the answer is a little bit of both. 
 I mean, the advantage of the on-wafer with the Gen 5 is that those tools already exist. And so right now, they could inspect those, albeit at a slower throughput. But of course, we're working on continuing to improve that capability both with increases in hardware but also a lot of the work we've been doing with machine learning and AI and the algorithm front to support those applications. 
 And then at the same time, we have the 8xx which we'll continue to support, as well as 6xx. And as I think you know, we also are working on next-generation reticle inspection as well. 
 So we got quite a bit of -- I think our 2 biggest investment programs inside the company are both dealing with the challenges of reticle inspection over the next several years. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Wes, and it looks like that brings us to the end of the call. 
 I wanted just to again remind everyone that we're hoping we can see you in person in New York, June 16. If you don't have an invitation, please do reach out to KLA IR team, and we will get you one. 
 And with that, I'll turn the call back over to David for any final statements. 
Operator: And this does conclude the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-01-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] 
 I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Leo, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q2 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter. With me on today's call is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. 
 During this call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31, 2021, released this afternoon after the market closed. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. 
 Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. And whenever we make references to full year business performance, it can be understood to be a calendar year. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings materials posted on our website. 
 Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosure in our SEC filings. 
 Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. 
 Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. Before summarizing KLA's results for calendar year 2021 and for the December quarter, I'd like to first acknowledge and thank the global KLA team. The dedication and hard work of our teams never wavered despite challenging conditions, delivering for customers and managing around a complex global supply chain during a period of unprecedented industry shortages. 
 It was the day-to-day drive to be better that drove KLA's market leadership, resulting in record growth and financial performance across the board for the company in the December quarter and for 2021. KLA also delivered record returns to shareholders in 2021 through our dividend and share repurchase programs with returns to shareholders totaling over $2 billion. 
 KLA's strong results demonstrate our track record of relative strength and revenue growth and superior financial performance compared with semiconductor industry peers in a dynamic and growing wafer fab equipment industry as well as the long-term value created by employee and consistently refining our KLA operating model. Since our founding in 1976, KLA's mission has been focused on using our expertise and innovative thinking to overcome monumental technological challenges. 
 KLA is advancing humanity with technologies and ideas that inspire action. Our results in the December quarter and for 2021, demonstrate ongoing success of these strategies. So thank you to all our teams for contributing to KLA's enduring success. 2021 was another year of record growth, profitability and free cash flow for KLA, as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges in the marketplace, responding to record demand across the vast majority of our markets, while adapting to the evolving operational complexities associated with the global pandemic. 
 Through it all, we remained focused on delivering to our customers' requirements and driving strong returns to shareholders in a rapidly growing industry demand environment. In 2021, revenue grew 34% to $8.2 billion, marking the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth. 
 KLA's strong revenue growth in 2021 was driven by 46% growth in the semiconductor process control systems. Revenue from the services business grew 14% in the year, with over 75% of the revenue generated from recurring subscription-like contracts, reflecting the growing value of added process control systems and services in our product portfolio. 
 KLA also demonstrated strong operating leverage on our revenue growth in 2021 with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share growing 54% and 61%, respectively. Incremental operating margin on the revenue growth in 2021 was 57%, consistently above our target operating leverage model of 40% to 50% for the second year in a row. 
 Free cash flow also grew a healthy 43% in 2021 to a record $2.5 billion. Consistent with our long-term strategic objectives, KLA delivered on our ongoing commitment to return value to shareholders, including our 12th consecutive dividend increase announced in July 2021, along with an additional $2 billion share repurchase program. 
 Total returns to shareholders in 2021, including dividend and share repurchases, topped just over $2 billion or approximately 79% of free cash flow. This growth demonstrates success in strengthening our market leadership across our business that we can continue to build upon to drive adoption of KLA solutions in the critical markets we serve. Within the Electronics, Packaging and Component inspection or EPC Group, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment grew 11% in 2021, and the Printed Circuit Board Display and Component Inspection grew 17% in the year. 
 The strong relative performance for KLA reflects our market leadership and diversification and was driven by secular industry growth trends across multiple end markets. We ended 2021 with an exceptionally strong backlog and began what we anticipate being a seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. We enter 2022 executing at a high level and operating from a position of strength in our marketplace despite persistent supply chain challenges. 
 This momentum sets the stage for KLA to continue to outperform the market while demonstrating superior financial performance and maintaining our capital returns. Turning now to focus on the December quarter results where we saw diversified strength across our business. Today, demand environment continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of a broad spectrum of semiconductor and electronic industry growth trends. 
 Technology is transforming how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, growth in new automotive electronics and strong growth in data centers and 5G communication markets. 
 Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation and advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control, and growth and expansion in new markets like Specialty Semiconductor Process equipment, PCB and finished die inspection in our EPC group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasing digital world. 
 To make this happen, KLA continues to prioritize and invest in R&D, which totaled $1 billion in calendar 2021, double the level of 5 years ago and growing at a 15% compound annual growth rate. With this favorable backdrop and our demonstrated track record of investing heavily in R&D to drive product differentiation and consistently meeting or exceeding our commitments to customers and shareholders, our performance enabled KLA to outperform the 2023 long-term financial model targets that we set 2 years ago, 2 years ahead of expectations. 
 Moving along to the top highlights from the December 2021 quarter. First, we saw continued strength and consistency in foundry logic customer revenue for both leading edge and legacy technologies in the December quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew in the period. Calendar 2022 is setting up to be another year of strong growth for WFE. 
 We see demand momentum throughout 2022 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA's essential role in supporting our customers' drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. In foundry and logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers, and we expect another year of double-digit growth in 2022 with NAND growing faster than DRAM; second, KLA is seeing strong demand across the breadth of our industry-leading optical inspection portfolio as we have maintained our momentum in one of the fastest-growing markets in WFE. 
 Wafer inspection systems revenues grew 54% in 2021, far outpacing the WFE market, which is estimated to have grown 40%. We're experiencing strong growth across our wafer inspection portfolio from broadband plasma, laser scanning, unpatterned bare wafer inspection, macro inspection and e-beam products. 
 This quarter, we highlight macro inspection, which is growing at a pace of 1.5x WFE driven by growth in automotive and other specialty markets where KLA has defensible market leadership with a platform uniquely positioned to address growing technical complexity and tighter design rules; third, success in KLA's strategic growth and market diversification strategies are being demonstrated by growth in EPC. 
 Systems revenue from KLA's Electronics, Packaging and Components, or EPC group, grew 20% in 2021. With EPC, KLA is diversifying our market leadership with a portfolio of solutions addressing fast-growing new markets in the electronics value chain, including RF, specialty semiconductors, automotive, PCB, advanced packaging and display; fourth, service revenue grew 14% in 2021 to $1.8 billion and continues to sustain a growth rate above its long-term target of 9% to 11%. For the quarter, services revenue was $457 million or 19% of total revenue. Annual services revenue is quickly approaching $2 billion and has grown 81% in the past 3 years. 
 This growth has been driven by the rising installed base and increasing adoption of subscription-like contracts. Over 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment, and over 90% of services in the printed circuit board business come from recurring subscription-like contracts. 
 Finally, the December quarter was another exceptional one from a free cash flow perspective, capping a year in which KLA generated over $2.5 billion in free cash flow and returned over $2 billion to shareholders. In the December quarter, we generated strong quarterly free cash flow of $746 million, which helped drive 43% growth in free cash flow in 2021. We've also maintained focus on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and share repurchase program, which rose 63% year-over-year on a combined basis. 
 Before Bren gets into greater detail on our financial highlights and guidance, let me briefly summarize. Despite the persistent disruption and continued challenges associated with the pandemic, particularly around the supply chain and component availability, KLA is consistently delivering strong revenue growth, financial results and returns to shareholders. 
 KLA is well positioned at the forefront of technological innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products targeting the most demanding inspection and measurement challenges in the marketplace. I also want to provide a quick update on our ESG activities. On December 16, KLA announced setting a goal to use 100% renewable electricity across our global operations by 2030. Managing the impacts of our business in terms of ESG stewardship is an integral part of KLA's mission to advance humanity. This includes contributing to creating a more sustainable future. 
 With that, I'll pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's December quarter and 2021 results highlight the continuation of strong execution in a dynamic and challenging market environment. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
 The December quarter capped off a year in 2021 that was defined by strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. We also invested almost $1 billion in R&D to sustain our success and $250 million in capital expenditures to grow our global infrastructure to support our industry growth thesis. All this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. 
 Total revenue in the December quarter was $2.35 billion, above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of $2.225 billion to $2.425 billion and up 13% sequentially versus the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.1%, just above the midpoint of the guided range of 62% to 64%. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.71 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.59, each within the guidance range. 
 Gross margins were 63.1% and in line with expectations as product mix and factory expenses ended the quarter mostly as planned. KLA's gross margin reflects the value we deliver to the marketplace and our competitive differentiation. To improve on our ability to meet our customer needs, we are also making meaningful investments in our global workforce, supply chain and factory infrastructure to position KLA to deliver our products in this growing demand environment. 
 Total non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly below the midpoint of the guided range of $465 million, including $265 million of R&D expense and $200 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was 43.4% in the December quarter. KLA's innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. 
 R&D is at the heart of what we do and remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy, new product introduction cadence and product differentiation. This in turn helps sustain our technology and market leadership. Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure and systems to scale the KLA operating model, as well as new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. 
 Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce and within outsourced partners. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $495 million in the March quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. 
 While operating expenses are modeled higher going forward as we will make the necessary investments to scale our business to support our long-term structural industry growth thesis, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. 
 Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $39 million, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 13.3%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate, given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it remains prudent to maintain our long-term tax planning rate at 13.5% going forward. 
 Non-GAAP net income was $851 million. GAAP net income was $717 million. Cash flow from operations was $811 million, and free cash flow was $746 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 88% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of 32%. The company had approximately 152 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding exiting the quarter. 
 Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $2.05 billion, up 49% compared with the December 2020 quarter and up 15% sequentially. Semiconductor Process Control systems and service grew 39% in calendar '21 versus calendar 2020. 
 Foundry logic was 71% of the approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix in the December quarter and memory was 29%. Within memory, the business was split roughly 54% DRAM and 46% NAND. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging and Components Group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. 
 More specifically, the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business generated record revenue of $113 million, up 24% over the prior year and up 10% sequentially. Specialty Semiconductor Process systems and service grew 11% for calendar '21. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $188 million, up 5% year-over-year, but down 7% sequentially. On a full calendar year basis, it grew 17%. 
 Our breakdown of revenue by major products and region can be found in the shareholder letter, so I won't cover those here. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing a balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns of 70% or more of free cash flow generated. 
 In 2021, KLA exceeded our long-term capital returns target, returning over $2 billion to shareholders, including $601 million in dividends paid and $1.4 billion in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. 
 KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the December quarter, we repurchased $430 million of common stock and paid $160 million in dividends. 
 As we begin the new year, our view is that the WFE market will grow in the high teens, topping $100 billion off a baseline of approximately $86 billion for 2021. WFE demand is still constrained by the industry's ability to supply. Strong industry growth momentum in 2022 across all end markets is expected to drive growth with the strongest percentage growth coming from foundry logic customers. And memory investment will be led by 3D NAND. 
 Now wrapping up with our outlook and guidance. Looking ahead, our backlog remains strong and sales funnel visibility over the near-term horizon is good. However, rising product lead times driven by increased supply chain constraints is limiting our near-term output. These issues are reducing our revenue expectation by 8% to 10% for the March quarter. 
 Specifically, COVID-related disruptions at a number of single-source suppliers have exacerbated what has already been a difficult supply situation where these suppliers have been challenged to meet demand by running their production at max capacity. These disruptions are causing delays in parts delivery timing across multiple product platforms. In addition, numerous electronic component sourcing challenges have become more acute over the past month as these are standardized parts and in demand across multiple industries. 
 We expect that the COVID-related impact will begin to abate shortly and new capacity or supply alternatives are expected to become available as we move through the calendar year. While these issues can be fluid and difficult to predict in the short run, we expect the March quarter revenue to represent the low point for calendar 2022, and we remain exceedingly confident in the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. 
 Given current expectations for growth in WFE and other electronics markets, we feel confident in our ability to grow throughout the year with total company revenue growth exceeding 20% and semiconductor process control systems revenue to outperform WFE growth again. Our confidence is based on current backlog levels, competitive positioning, strong customer engagement, and steps we continue to take to add capacity to address output constraints in what continues to be a robust demand environment. 
 Our March quarter 2022 guidance is as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in a range of $2.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 59% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue. 
 Memory is expected to be approximately 41%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5% as overall revenue levels declined modestly on a sequential basis and product mix dilutes gross margins by roughly 50 basis points versus the prior quarter. To provide some color for the calendar year, given higher revenue volume, product mix expectations across our various segments offset by expected cost pressures within our supply chain, we are modeling gross margins to be approximately 63% for the year, plus or minus 50 basis points. 
 Other model assumptions for the March quarter include operating expenses of approximately $495 million, interest and other expense of approximately $41 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. 
 Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.54, plus or minus $0.45, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.80 plus or minus $0.45. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 151 million shares. In conclusion, we have exceptionally strong and diversified end market dynamics propelling semiconductors and the essential WFE investments required to make them. 
 Furthermore, we are seeing revenue growth opportunities as more innovation occurs and technology complexity increases in specialty semiconductors, advanced packaging and other electronics markets. Finally, our services offerings continue to deliver more value to our customers in our Semiconductor Process Control business, and their evolving opportunities to further expand our value proposition in our acquired businesses. Our record backlog is supported by solid customer demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 
 2022 is setting up to be the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for WFE and the seventh consecutive year of growth for KLA. The KLA operating model fuels KLA's strategic objectives and positions us to outperform the industry in terms of growth and financial performance. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. 
 They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat and strong record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A session. Kevin? 
Kevin Kessel: Go ahead and queue for questions. Sorry about that. 
Operator: No worries. [Operator Instructions] 
 We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Rick, as you pointed out in your prepared comments, you guys have been dealing and the industry has been dealing with a difficult supply situation all year, but this is the first quarter that you and others have seen to have a meaningful impact on the business. 
 And I'm kind of curious as to what specifically happened in the last 90 days to make things worse. And I guess, more importantly, as you call March as the bottom, what gives you confidence that these problems won't persist even longer? 
Richard Wallace: John, thanks for the question. Yes, we feel pretty good about how we've navigated through the pandemic. A couple of factors for KLA specific, I think, to think about. One is we were up in the December quarter. And again, huge customer demand, so working to work that off. We talked in the past about securing critical components, critical parts from key suppliers. That actually continues to be in good shape, where we had some challenges in the last few weeks. 
 And right now, as we're actually working through them, had to do with not necessarily our critical supply but just generalized supply across the industry. I think as most companies are talking about. So we're seeing some of that, that are not unique, as Bren said in his comments, to KLA. The reason we feel more confident is even in the last few days, we've seen some pressure being released in that system, that it won't be in time for what we would have preferred to ship in this quarter, we obviously have the backlog, we could have shipped more if we'd had it. 
 But it's being resolved. So we feel pretty good about the go forward after we get through March. And I'll let Bren add some color since he's spending a good part of his time working some of these issues himself. 
Bren Higgins: Hey John, how are you? So just to add to Rick's comments. I think one of the things you have to consider is most of our strategic buffer that we've built, whether we have it in inventory levels at the company, whether it's at inventory or long lead time materials that we've either procured or suppliers have procured. Over the last 15 months or so, given the strength of demand, we have worked through a fair amount of that. And that's one of the challenges we have is we are more dependent today on the predictability of timing, first of all, but also volume of quality. And so I think those are issues that we continue to work through. As Rick said, in our complex systems, we generally have a pretty transparent view of where that demand is, although everyone is struggling to meet the demand environment that we're facing today. 
 But it's in our higher volume but single sourced type products where we've seen some of these pressures. We did not anticipate a COVID variant and what that would do to those factories in terms of people having to leave either because of contact or exposure. So you had facilities that are already running 100% max that all of a sudden had to deal with this disruption in a lot of cases, a pretty meaningful disruption in the first part of the month. 
 We think that, that's abating. And we're getting a sense that that's improving. And this COVID environment, we'll have to figure out and navigate our way through. We don't know what the future holds. But at least in terms of the near-term environment, we feel pretty good about that. 
 And then trying to source and find all the electrical components, which are deeper in our build of material and within our supply chain. There's less visibility, but there's also alternative, either alternative supplies, qualifying new parts in some cases, leveraging third parties, which we've been doing, and that's even becoming more challenged in terms of distributors and others that might be out there that have those parts. 
 So we're managing through this. We're escalating where appropriate. And as we look at it and walk through what we expect to see moving forward, we think the March quarter sets up as the bottom, and we expect -- given the guidance we gave that we would see growth through the year and expect the company to be somewhere in excess of 20%, as we said in the prepared remarks. So there's always some questions or unpredictability here in terms of just where things are, but that's the best of how we see it today. 
John Pitzer: And then, Bren, just as my follow-up. You gave some very specific guidance for OpEx even beyond the March quarter, growing sequentially throughout the year, but still within the model of 40% to 50% incremental gross -- operating margin, sorry. I'm just kind of curious, I have to imagine that this year, the supply constraints are causing some excess costs that might bleed down over time as supply gets better. 
 And there's a bigger mismatch, I'm assuming between revenue collection and investment this year. So as you start to recapture some of this revenue as supply gets better, should we assume that incremental op margins closer to the higher end of that 40% to 50%? Or how should we think about that as revenue growth accelerates beyond March? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. No, you're thinking about it right. As we see revenue growth, it should accelerate to the higher end of the range. The commentary was really about how we look and size the company on an annual basis or over a longer-term horizon. And if you look at '19 to our '22 planning, we will have had incremental operating margins given the growth we've seen in excess of 50%, about 52%. So my point was that we would expect revenue to grow. We're also expecting OpEx to grow. But at the end of the day, as we're sizing 2022, we expect to be in our target range of 40 to 50. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Great execution by the operations team. In calendar '21, your Process Control Systems business outgrew WFE by about 8 percentage points. So strong performance there. So as we look at your WFE outlook for this year, right, up 16% to $100 billion, taking into account rising cost of control intensity, your portfolio of new products, how should we think about your Process Control Systems growth profile relative to WFE this year? It's clearly going to outperform, but should we expect a similar type of outperformance like you saw in '21 or maybe even better, just given the customer mix and the complexity challenges? And is it going to again be led by wafer inspection? 
Richard Wallace: Harlan. Good question. Yes, '21, we feel really good about how we performed in '21. I think we talked about several times, just the strength, especially of optical wafer inspection was extraordinary in the year. And also, when we look to our order book, we got tremendous interest in those products that we're seeing great opportunities in '22 as well. 
 I think that's a favorable mix for the year for '22 and -- based on the success we've had with some of our new products and the way that they're being received by customers, we anticipate that we'll be in a good position to build on our market leadership position as we go forward. 
 So we are anticipating continued growth in share, albeit at the kind of rate that we outlined a few years ago. So I think the combination of those factors plus the continuation of the drive in design roles are all good indicators and good drivers for KLA to outperform, which is what we're forecasting. We never really know at this point in the year, how it's actually going to -- the details of what it's going to look, but we think Process Control is in a great position for '22, and we're in a great position within Process Control. And Bren can add some color to that. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. I think that what we'll see in terms of mix, I would expect foundry logic to grow faster this year than it grew -- or faster than the growth rate in WFE. And as a result of that, that will be a favorable mix. So to Rick's point, I think that, that will be a driver for us. From a share point of view, we feel pretty good about where we are. Certainly, wafer inspection, as you mentioned, has been the biggest driver. It's been the fastest-growing business in the company. We have a very strong position there. I've said many times, I think it might be one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE. 
 I would expect to continue to see momentum in that overall market. So as we said in the prepared remarks that we were about -- we thought we were around 46% for semiconductor systems in 2021. It gets the market of 40% or 41%. And then as we look at high teens type growth rates in WFE this year, I would expect we'll have a similar improvement over the market or similar outperform, somewhere in that mid-single-digit range based on how we're looking at it today. 
Harlan Sur: And I appreciate the insights there. And then on the gross margin front, I understand the supply challenges and other logistics-related dynamics that are impacting your shipments here. But relative to your peers, I mean, your gross margins are holding up extremely well, right? I mean you guys are only guiding for roughly a 50 basis point decline sequentially in gross margins here in the March quarter. And it actually looks like that's more mix and volume related, right? And in the midst of all of these potential cost dynamics, you're still guiding full year gross margins to 63%. 
 So help us understand the better sustainability of gross margins in this challenging period. I mean, are you guys just passing along exercising some pricing power and just passing along some of these cost to your customers? 
Bren Higgins: That's a great question, Harlan, and I'll start and maybe Rick will want to add a few comments here. But our pricing model is really based on pricing to value. It's priced on the value we believe that our tools add to our customers. And so that's ultimately how we price the products. It isn't a cost-based model. It's more of a value-based. You're right, as you look at the March quarter, what's declining is Semiconductor Process Control revenue quarter-to-quarter, we're actually expecting some growth in our EPC business and every quarter service grows. 
 So it is a bit of a mix effect and a volume effect on the March quarter. Going forward, we are seeing pressure on costs. We're not implying that we aren't and I've been pretty open with the fact that I think there's 100 basis point headwind related to cost increases as we all know, everything seems to be costing more. 
 Labor is costing more and certainly the ramp in investments our customers -- or suppliers are having to make is driving incremental cost into the model but that's factored in. So absent that, I think given the mix expectations we would have moving into '22 with the growth rate of semi PC consistent with what your last question, then we would see margins improve. But we are feeling a little bit of pressure. 
 So I think we hold 63%, plus or minus in any given quarter, you'll see a little bit of variability. But at the end of the day, I also think it's just -- it's a reflection of the value that we're adding, I think it's also a reflection of the differentiation that we have across the portfolio in the marketplace. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Just one other thing to add to Bren, I mean I think it's really important that we continue to understand the value we're creating for our customers, and we share in that value in our pricing. I think that's the way to think about it. For them, they're very, very motivated to get these products in as soon as they can because the payback is extremely quick. 
 What you would probably see in a more normalized -- if you didn't have an environment that was a supply constrained -- with the increase in volume, you'd actually see the cost dynamics go the other way. So I think what Bren talked about the little bit of headwind that we get is because of some of the pricing increases, but it's not much in our overall business. 
 But in a historical context, if you went up as much as our revenues have, we would see volume discounting happening with our suppliers, which would bring down some of the costs, and that's not really happening in this environment. But our starting point is really good, and our new products are incredibly well received by our customers. So not only do we like the margin profile, but our customers really want to get the new products. So we're in a pretty good position as it stands right now. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from C.J. Muse of Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess another gross margin question, if we really drilled down just the process control, you grew gross margins there, 64% in 2020 to 65% in 2021. And I'm cognizant of the fact that there's clearly some challenges near term. But as you think about the mix that you're seeing and the value add that you're bringing, where do you think process control gross margins can go in a more normalized environment once the supply chain normalizes? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, C.J., it's a great question. You're right. We're in the mid-65% range, if you look at the process control segment overall. So as we move into certainly '22, I would expect that to be roughly flat given what we just said, maybe a little bit better, but generally in that range and just given the things we just talked about. A lot of it depends overall on -- you've got the service mix, which service gross margins have improved over time as that business scales, but it is dilutive. 
 So in the long run, if service is growing faster than systems, that does put a little bit of pressure on margins. So I think we're pretty comfortable with the levels that they're at. I can see them ticking up. 
 We always talk about 60% to 65% type incrementals on our semi process control business. So I would expect to see something consistent with that. But if you're approaching 65% or maybe a little bit higher at the top end of that, you start to hit the ceiling in terms of how high you can go. So I think we're probably in that mid-60s range, maybe creeping up a little bit from there. But I don't see it improving much more than that. 
Christopher Muse: That's helpful. As my follow-up, I guess, can you comment on whether you expect to be constrained in the June quarter? And as we think about kind of second half total revenues versus first half on a calendar basis, should we be thinking kind of low- to mid-double-digit growth half-on-half? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. Certainly, the second half will be stronger than the first half. And look, I think we're all constrained right now in terms of the ability to get parts. What we've provided is our expected probability of all the various issues we're managing in terms of an overall view. 
 But given that March will be lower, I would expect sequential growth as we move through the year. And the second half overall for the company, yes, low- to mid-double digits is a reasonable way to think about it. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. 
Vivek Arya: I actually wanted to ask the last question in a slightly different way. So as you go into June, so I think you're suggesting about a $200 million impact in the March quarter. Are you able to recognize that $200 million in June? Or is that spread into the back half of the year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Vivek, it will show up in the June quarter. So these are shipments that slipped out and then are in the June quarter. But when you have suppliers that are running at max capacity in a lot of cases, and they have a disruption, I think the making up of that lost time will take some time through the year, right? I don't think that they'll be able to make it all of it once. So there's a little bit of a cascading that happens whenever you have a disruption in a facility that's already running full out, I mean, equipment is running 24/7, people are working up to legal limits in terms of overtime. 
 So trying to squeeze more capacity in the short run is a little bit harder. But over time, I would expect that we'll see that creep out. We also expect capacity to improve or have alternatives to materialize as we move through the year. So it's a combination of those effects. But yes, I would expect it to move into the June quarter. 
Richard Wallace: So just one  -- just a little more color to think about. What we saw with Omicron is more people being impacted and losing work days, fortunately not severely impacted, but enough that they had to not be at the workforce. And as Bren said, these factories were ramped up. So it's hard to make that up, but it's also -- they're already coming back. So we have a lot of confidence in the supply chain, returning to more supportive levels for our business going forward. 
Vivek Arya: All right. And for my follow-up, I realize it's super, super early, but I was just hoping if you could give us a flavor of customer discussions about 2023? WFE in the past has kind of grown for 2 to 3 years, and there is a period of absorption. This time, we have already had -- or this will be the third year of growth. Do you think it's possible to have a fourth year of growth? And what would be the high-level kind of puts and takes, just so that investors get a sense for is this the peak year for WFE? Or are there still prospects for additional growth next year? 
Richard Wallace: Vivek, great question. I think, ironically, perhaps the current slowdown in our ability as an equipment industry to provide will stretch this out into '23 anyway. And so you see that plus a number of high-profile projects, which have been discussed recently by our customers don't really order equipment in '22 or maybe they place POs, but we certainly don't see deliveries. 
 So if you think about some of the big new greenfield projects that have been announced, those are '23 projects, not '22. So I think the combination of those that are related to both support from the regionalization efforts driven by things like the CHIPS Act in the U.S. should that come to pass. But even the other projects, which aren't dependent on that, are really much more about '23 than they are about '22. So as we look at it now, we do have pretty good visibility out through the end of the year and even into the first part of next year for the demand to continue to be very supportive of our business. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Vivek, the only other thing I would add to that is that we have very high levels of backlog. In a lot of cases, we're booking slots for customers into 2023 now. And so as a result of that, we feel pretty confident in the sustainability of what we're seeing. I made some comments earlier about the second half and as we model in terms of how we're planning the company and how we're planning capacity, we expect to see that -- those levels of business sustain as we move forward. So it's a long way out and things can change. 
 But certainly, we don't see anything that shows any slowing down anytime in the horizon. And certainly, customers are asking for more and faster. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: I had 2, Bren, one kind of on the same tack as the last question. So it seems like the WFE in the first half of the year were sort of entering March a bit lower than what -- most of us would have thought just because of some of these constraints. But the back half is going to be a lot bigger. If you just take your number, you're going to do like 18 -- I mean, maybe even 19 in terms of process control shipments -- system shipments in the back half of the year. And if you basically take your WFE share, that's like a $110 billion annualized WFE. 
 So my question is, when you sort of think about that number and you go back and you try to determine what the demand really supports in terms of WFE, sort of looking at the projects and looking at the technology transitions and what not. How do you handicap sort of -- where you cry uncle on sort of where the WFE run rate becomes too high? And do you agree with the [ 185 ] or somewhere in that range of system number for the back half of the year? 
Bren Higgins: Tim, on the last part of your question, given the guidance we gave around second half, you're probably not that far off. It's probably in that 18 range, plus or minus, more or less. So we'll have to see how it plays out. Look, we spent a lot of time looking at the various leading indicators of what we're seeing from customers. And of course, we look at our customers, the discussions we have with them, there is the profitability levels. We look at these end markets and some of the challenges that exist there. 
 So as we go through it, you look at our customers are spending more than they ever have. They're more profitable than they've ever been. So we feel pretty good about where they're at and where the demand is. So we're going to -- we'll continue to watch it. But right now, at this point, we -- our customers are continuing to ask for systems. As I said earlier, I think WFE is constrained by supply. And over the long run, we believe that WFE, given rising capital intensity will grow faster than semiconductor revenue in terms of a long run trend. 
 So I think that's how we're modeling the company. Certainly, it's how we're planning when we think about supply and investments we need to make. But that's how we're thinking about it right now. 
Timothy Arcuri: And then just maybe a bigger picture, Rick, I'm sort of curious what your view is. I get a lot of questions around as you go to sort of scaling that's a little more verticalized versus using litho to scale, whether you're talking about [indiscernible] or 3D DRAM, things like that. It isn't exactly what happened in NAND, but litho does become a little bit maybe less of a driver for actually to scale going forward. Can you just talk about how you think about how that affects you either positively or negatively sort of in terms of your ability to keep on gaining WFE share? And maybe what you're attach to litho is sort of how you think about that bigger picture? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Tim. Good question. I think that it's interesting if you use the example of NAND as a -- there, you actually went backwards in lithography. And yet the process control intensity, it went down a little bit, but we actually thought it would go down more because what happened was 2 things. And if we'd had solutions, it probably wouldn't have gone down at all because there were other integration problems that we were unable to solve at that time. But even there, it went backwards and there was not a huge change in process control intensity, albeit at lower levels. 
 What we're seeing now already in conversations with customers as we look at new device types. The process control challenges are going to be enormous. And many of them, yes, defect is a big part of it, but you have EUV, which is driving additional use cases. You have the registration overlay challenges, which has created quite a significant market, and we also see the need for more and more inspection layers using different wavelengths. So that Gen 4 is being extended. I think we mentioned last quarter, Gen 4 actually outperformed Gen 5 in terms of revenue in 2021. 
 And we actually see that continuing because of the usefulness of that product and that wavelength. So we actually think the real question is, are there going to be integration challenges that are going to drive our customers. When there's multiple players competing at the leading edge, that's always a good thing for KLA. I think we went through a period where there was really one main driver, and they had one real end device driving that logic, that's no longer the case. 
 So we feel pretty good about the architectures that we're seeing. We have process control teams that are working with our customers. And as far as we can see out through several years, we think we're well positioned with plenty of opportunity and we have a lot of solutions we're investing in, as Bren said, we're investing at a significant level in R&D to be positioned to support those going forward. 
 So we don't see really a relaxation in process control intensity as we go forward. Will it continue to rise? We're not anticipating that it goes up a lot. And so that's not in our models, that would be upside to our model if that happened, but that's not what we're working off of. 
Bren Higgins: Tim, 2 things. First, when we move from planar to vertical and NAND, if you use NAND as a proxy, we saw a couple of point improvement overall in process control intensity. And it came really in our metrology businesses because if you think you're starting to build the structures vertically, it creates a whole new set of metrology challenges. So we saw an inflection there for metrology and then you also have defect mechanisms related to high-aspect layers -- high-aspect ratio structures and so on. So that is -- if it's a proxy, we feel pretty good about opportunities there as some of the defect mechanisms, and metrology challenges change, but process control intensity overall is a positive. 
 Our 2023 plan in terms of process control or KLA share of WFE was to see process control intensity improve, KLA share of WFE to grow about 75 to 100 basis points from 2019. And we feel like we're right on that trajectory as we go forward here. So as Rick said, we don't expect it to grow a lot, but we do expect to see it continuing to grow, and that should create opportunities for us to, for the most part, consistently outgrow the market here over the next few years. 
Operator: We'll move next to Patrick Ho of Stifel. 
Patrick Ho: Rick, maybe just following up on that question by Tim in terms of process control intensity in terms of device architecture. As we look at gate all around, and I know you've talked about it from a big picture perspective of some of the opportunities there. But given the materials intensity, how do you see, I guess, more semiconductor engineering materials type of trends benefiting process control intensity? And especially, I'm just thinking gate all around, the gates now being surrounded by a lot of materials. How do you look at it from both an inspection and probably from an overlay metrology perspective? Do you see one or the other "benefiting" from these changes on the materials front? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, Patrick, good question. I think that, again, we've been in conversations with customers about these advanced architectures for some time and the challenges that they face. 
 Fortunately, we often have more time than we originally thought to get our solutions ready because these often take longer to get to market than were originally anticipated. So we're actually in pretty good shape in terms of providing solutions for that. Specifically to gate all around, remember, for inspection, there are really a couple of things that we have to -- problems that we have to solve. 
 The most significant one often lost on people is it's a contrast question. It's not as much as a resolution as contrast and gate all around with different materials creates a different contrast challenge, which is why the wavelength matters a lot, which is why we're extending Gen 4, and we're seeing good modeling results from that. The other thing that happens, of course, is the registration, every generation, I think, may be lost on people are the additional challenges in registration and overlay every device technology and the increase in sampling is just dramatic in that business and in films in general. 
 Again, more challenges associated with that. We have a good modeling effort that goes on very, very strong in the company so we can model and understand what those devices are going to look like and what they're going to need in terms of capability. 
 So we're very well positioned to handle that. I think that you're going to see increases in both inspection needs, but also in metrology slightly in different ways. And in metrology, you're already sampling at so many levels. It's more about increasing the sampling at those levels. In other words, more steps or more measurement points per die and per wafer. In inspection, it ends up you add a number of inspection steps in the process as opposed to the area inspected, which is usually already predetermined and that probably won't change. 
 So I think that they'll both grow but for different reasons in that. And again, our customers -- our relationship with our customers is such that we've been working on these problems for a while because now they know they need the support of inspection and metrology early in the development phase if they have a chance of ramping these new technologies. So we feel pretty good about our insight into those. 
Patrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up. The current environment obviously is seeing very high utilization across fabs for both leading edge and trailing edge. Given the supply chain issues, and I know not all parts and components are the same for both new systems and "your spare parts business, your installed base business." But how are you balancing some of the procurement issues that you're dealing with today in terms of where do I take this component or parts? Should it go into the spare parts bucket? Or should it go into a new system? How are you balancing that today? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, Patrick, it's a great question and it's something that we spend a lot of time on internally, particularly as Brian Lorig runs our service business points out to me all the time that don't forget about spares. So it is absolutely a balancing act. Fortunately, we have pretty good idea of when things will fail that -- around certain components, and we can plan for that. But we -- in terms of stocking levels. But we're very -- we have had situations where we will pull parts off of systems, if we have to, to support the field, we've made commitment to customers, those customers value these systems, and we've got to keep them up and running. 
 So in a lot of those cases, we're going to generally prioritize service if we can't figure out a way to work around it, which we've for the most part been able to do. But it's a constant balancing act, and it's something that we watch very closely. 
Operator: We have time for one last question, and we'll take Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the supply constraints in terms of how much planning were you able to do around it? Did you get surprised by these component issues? And are you generally just kind of meeting commitments to your customers but the lead times are getting pushed out? Or was there kind of a decommitment because of disruptions in your own supply chain? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Joe, that's a great question. So I'll say a couple of things here. First, yes, there were some surprises, right? As we were moving through December and into the early part of January, the COVID impact was a surprise in terms of the impact on some of these suppliers. So we also had some issues that materialized, as I said in the prepared remarks around, I'll call them, more lower-value commodity parts that we also procure in a lot of cases, where those are as we have supplier suppliers that are trying to acquire those parts to then send them to us to our direct suppliers before it gets to us. So it's a little bit harder to have visibility down at those levels. 
 Now with enough time, you can typically manage around some of those issues, either by finding alternatives, qualifying alternatives. It does have an impact on on-time delivery, to your point, and so the reason we were able to quantify the impact of 8% to 10% on the results in March was really what we thought we were looking at as we ended the December quarter and where we ended up today. So we had a pretty good visibility to the impact and so we're able to quantify it. On-time delivery is what's suffering though. But we're managing around it to the extent we can. 
 And I think customers, while there's tremendous pressure in the system, there's a reality check of the challenges that I think I can speak for everybody that we're all dealing with here. 
Kevin Kessel: Great. Thank you, Joe and thank you, everybody, for joining us. We know it's a busy week of earnings, a busy day of earnings. We really appreciate everyone's time and attention. I'm sure we'll be catching up with many of you throughout the quarter. With that I'll pass the call back over to Leo to end the call. 
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2021 Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2021-10-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Ashley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ] Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]
 And I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA's Fiscal Q1 2022 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the September quarter and the outlook for the December quarter. With me on today's call is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2021, released this afternoon after market close. You can find the press release, shareholder letter, slide deck and infographic on the KLA IR section of our website. 
 Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. And whenever we make references to a year, we are referring to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in the earnings material posted on our website. Our IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. 
 Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. 
 Let me now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. KLA September 2021 quarter continued our track record of consistent execution and commitment to outperformance. The company's focus on delivering on top and bottom line goals remained at the forefront of how we run our business. 
 During the quarter, revenue grew 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year to $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.64, representing 5% sequential growth and up 53% compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA financial model. 
 Customer demand across KLA's major product groups continues as secular trends drive growth across a broad range of markets and applications in the industry. This growth is putting pressure on the semiconductor industry supply across multiple technology nodes. In parallel, leading-edge customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to improve their ability to address market demanding new semiconductor capabilities. Against this intense demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating with purpose and precision and keeping our focus on creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders. 
 Now turning to the industry demand environment. KLA remains in an excellent position when we look at the industry demand landscape. Strong secular growth drivers are creating important tailwinds that translate into momentum for our business. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for the wafer fab equipment, or WFE, industry. Last quarter, we estimated WFE growth would be in the mid-30s percent range. We now estimate that WFE will grow to approximately 40% in 2021. With sustained demand trends, we expect positive industry dynamics to continue into calendar 2022 and fuel another year of growth. 
 Along with increased demand due to digitization across multiple categories, KLA's business is benefiting from customers increasing their focus on investment in leading-edge development, optimization of fab utilization or established production nodes and regionalization for future fab construction. To address this growth, we continue to invest high levels of R&D to ensure we're constantly improving and remaining indispensable for our customers. 
 For example, we are prioritizing investment in R&D for software that enhances the value customers extract from KLA systems. Data analytics, advanced simulation and machine learning technologies are driving adoption of process control. KLA's data analytics performed platforms connect, centralize and analyze the data produced by our systems in the field. This creates a network effect that enhances performance across the product portfolio and for customers. 
 KLA's breadth of products is uniquely positioned to speed time to results for our customers. We're making investments in these critical technologies as process control intensity increases. KLA's market leadership in the process control markets remain in impressive level -- at an impressive level of 4x the nearest competitor. Thanks to focus on execution and the industry demand backdrop, we remain on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. 
 Let's now move along to the top highlights for the quarter. First, we continue to benefit from strength across all major end markets with overall company revenue expected to be up in the mid-30s on a percentage basis year-over-year based on the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. While we're not immune to the unprecedented supply chain challenges affecting the electronics industry, we are navigating them as well as can be expected. 
 In foundry/logic, simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and rising capital intensity continues to be a tailwind. In memory, demand remains broad-based across multiple customers with growth in 2021 led by DRAM and 2022 is setting up to be a relatively strong year for NAND. Second, our optical metrology business continues to stand out. KLA's metrology revenue is on track to grow meaningfully faster than the WFE market in 2021 after experiencing similar levels of absolute growth in 2020. The optical metrology market is strongly leveraged to EUV and its critical next-generation architectures, including gate all around and multi-stack 3D NAND. Third, KLA's leadership in the largest and fastest-growing segments of the process control market is fueling strong relative growth in our Semiconductor Process Control segment. 
 Optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021 for product segments over $1 billion in revenue. KLA's cadence of innovation and new product introduction continues to outpace the competition. Just last month, we introduced our new Voyager 1035 laser scanning patterned wafer inspector, the latest in an extensive portfolio of in-line defect inspection tools for critical process monitoring application and advanced chip manufacturing. Coupled with the Gen 4 and Gen 5 broadband plasma portfolio, KLA's laser scanning systems help comprise the most comprehensive optical pattern wafer inspection portfolio in the marketplace today. 
 Fourth, our services revenue was $454 million in the September quarter, up 15% year-over-year. For the quarter, it was 22% of revenue. More than 75% of service revenue in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and over 90% of services in the PCB business comes from recurring subscription-like contracts. Services is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth in 2021. This is driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rates and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. 
 Finally, the September quarter was exceptional from a free cash flow perspective. We generated record quarterly free cash flow of $795 million, which helped drive last 12-month free cash flow, up 42% year-over-year to $2.29 billion. We also have remained focused on returning capital to shareholders via our dividend and stock repurchase program, both of which are up materially year-over-year, including $563 million in share repurchases and dividends in the quarter. 
 In addition to executing against our strategic objectives and disciplined capital management, KLA delivers enduring value through corporate stewardship. KLA's values are reflected in efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, provide for a safe and healthy workplace for employees, advanced inclusion and diversity and make positive contributions to the communities where we live and work. 
 We published our latest Global Impact report in August 2021. It highlights how KLA delivers lasting values through corporate citizenship. Our journey on this path began when we opened our doors in 1976. We are now expanding our efforts to be more holistic across environmental, social and governance topics most relevant to our business. 
 We've also broadened our tracking and reporting to be inclusive of our full global footprint and acquired companies. We continue to build our long-term ESG strategy to focus on reducing climate impact, increasing disclosure and deepening the positive impact we deliver through our business and community engagement. 
 With that, I will pass the call over to Bren to cover our financial highlights, outlook and guidance. 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's quarterly results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 
 Total quarterly revenue was $2.08 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9% as the various components performed mostly as expected, with upside coming from the higher-than-expected Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue, which enhanced the product mix for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.64. 
 Our performance reflected the mark-to-market of an equity position in a strategic supplier that negatively impacted non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. Without this adjustment, which is reflected in other income and expense on the income statement, non-GAAP earnings would have been $4.70. 
 GAAP diluted EPS was $6.96, due primarily to a onetime tax benefit of $395 million, resulting from changes made to our international structure to better align ownership of certain intellectual property rights with how our business operates. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million and included $252 million of R&D expense and $180 million of SG&A. 
 Technical applications is a competitive advantage for KLA and drives demand for our products by helping our customers develop solutions that address their complex process challenges. Technical applications is included in SG&A and was $47 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D and technical applications represented approximately 70% of total operating expenses. 
 Given the rapid growth of the business over the last couple of years and our revenue expectations for the business going forward, we expect the company's operating expenses to continue to grow as we invest in global infrastructure, systems to scale the KLA operating model, new product development programs and volume-dependent resources to support our business expansion. Furthermore, we, as most companies are seeing a strong labor market driving cost pressure across our global workforce. As a result, we expect operating expenses to grow sequentially to approximately $470 million in the December quarter, and we forecast sequential growth in operating expenses to continue through calendar 2022. 
 While operating expenses are trending higher, going forward, we will make the necessary investments to scale our business, while we continue to size the company based on our target operating model, which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a normalized time horizon. 
 Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was strong at 42.2% in the September quarter. Other income and expense net was $52 million compared with guidance of $43 million, with the variance from guidance reflecting the impact of the mark-to-market of the investment discussed earlier. For December, we forecast other income and expense net at approximately $44 million. 
 The quarterly effective tax rate was 13.9%, just above our guided tax rate of 13.5%. Non-GAAP net income was $712 million. GAAP net income was $1.07 billion. Cash flow from operations was $864 million, and free cash flow was a record $795 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 112%. 
 Turning to our reportable segment and end markets. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business, was $1.78 billion, up 40% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The approximate Semiconductor Process Control system customer segment mix was tilted slightly more towards foundry logic than we forecasted at 61%, above our 59% estimate. 
 Memory was 39%, and within memory, the business was split roughly 61% DRAM and 39% NAND. Revenue for our EPC group continues to be driven by strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure as well as continued demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which includes its associated service business, generated record revenue of $102 million, up 15% over the prior year and up 4% sequentially. 
 PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $203 million, up 12% year-over-year but down 18% sequentially after a record quarter in the PCB and the component inspection businesses in June. For a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, please see our shareholder letter or the earnings slides. 
 Moving forward to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.63 billion in cash, bonds outstanding of $3.45 billion with no maturities until 2024 and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. 
 Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.73 billion to shareholders, including $581 million in dividends paid and $1.15 billion in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, current expectations are the capital returns for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow generated in the calendar year. 
 For the quarter, we generated a record $795 million in free cash flow and repurchased $400 million of common stock while also paying $163 million in dividends. 
 Moving to our outlook and guidance. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterize the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. In July, we revised our WFE outlook upward again to the mid-30s. Today, we see continued strengthening and expect the WFE market to grow approximately 40% to the mid-$80 billion range in 2021, growing from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. This reflects the broad-based strengthening in demand across all customer segments. 
 KLA is in a position to deliver strong relative growth this year with the semiconductor process control systems business now expected to grow in the mid-40s on a percentage basis over calendar year 2020. This growth profile is driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms. 
 Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the strength and sustainability of our current demand profile across all customer segments. For the total company, we expect that the first half of 2022 will grow in the high single digits versus the second half of 2021. It is abundantly clear today that demand is constrained by the industry's ability to supply. This pent-up demand should enable another year of solid growth in 2022. 
 While it's too early to put a fine point on our growth expectations for next calendar year, early indications point towards the WFE industry maintaining its growth momentum. Given our bookings momentum and strong backlog, we believe KLA is well positioned to outperform WFE. As in calendar 2021, we are adding capacity strategically across our global manufacturing footprint to drive this outlook and to enable us to support our customers' process control requirements. 
 Our December quarter guidance is as follows: total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion, plus or minus $100 million; foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 74%; and memory is expected to be approximately 26% of Semiconductor Process Control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 53% of the segment mix and NAND is forecasted to be 47%. 
 We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 64%. At the midpoint, gross margin is roughly flat sequentially as revenue volume and product mix improvement is offset by higher expected service and manufacturing costs. Other model assumptions for December include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $470 million, other income and expense net of approximately $44 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.69 to $5.59 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.95 to $5.85. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares. 
 In conclusion, the tailwinds driving semiconductor growth and investments in WFE continue to remain compelling. Broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes are strong and resilient trends. We have confidence in the leading indicators of our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility, which is spurring us to invest in expanding our business infrastructure and the required capabilities to support our outlook. Our customers' multiyear investment plans provide an element of stability in the demand outlook for the future. 
 KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform our industry and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, long-standing track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. 
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. Ashley, can you please queue up for questions? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Congratulations on the solid results and outlook. Rick, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your optimism around the NAND market, whether it's the December guide specifically where it's moving up as a mix or in your prepared comments, you said that next calendar year is setting up for a strong year in NAND. To what extent is that just being driven by technology transitions that might be a little bit more insulated from the overall market conditions in the NAND market overall? 
Richard Wallace: John, yes, thanks. It is -- for us, it is more driven by technology transitions than overall capacity. As you know, mostly, that's what drives the early adoption of our leading technologies. And what we're seeing with NAND is, NAND is as the design rules or the complexity continues, we're seeing a larger adoption of process control. As you know, the design rules aren't as advanced in NAND as they are as DRAM, but they're getting more challenging. And so that's driving larger amount of inspection requirement but also quite a bit in metrology as well. So it's really both. 
Bren Higgins: John, it's Bren. I mean it is picking up off of pretty low levels, right? And I think overall, if you look at the growth of the year for the market, the NAND market grew considerably. It was growing but considerably slower than the overall market. So there's some optimism there in terms of we are seeing some tick up, although the percentage is, as I said, the absolute value is not a lot. And I think as we move into the first part of '22. I think we'll see a little bit more investment there. 
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren, just going back to your commentary around OpEx, it makes sense given the opportunity ahead of you that you guys are making the investments. I'm wondering if you can just put some guardrails on growing sequentially every quarter from that $470 million level. Where might the exit trajectory be next year? And I guess, is there any flexibility around a revenue environment that might become a little bit more volatile in the second half of the year? 
Bren Higgins: It's a great question, John. And we're in the middle of our strategic planning process right now and assessing not just our top line expectations but how to size the company relative to program demands, but also some of the volume dependencies that we've seen. We're also making significant investments in infrastructure. 
 So as you got the world coming back from travel, you've got programs, you've got infrastructure investments. Those are all driving what we're seeing. We're certainly feeling pressure as most companies are, as we said in the prepared remarks, around compensation. So that's also a big part of it. 
 I'm not going to guide '22 because we're going through that process. But what I would say is that based on how we size the company, we're going to size -- we do expect growth in the company, and we'll size the company based on our incremental margin model, which is 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth. And so that will be a driver for us. 
 Certainly, some of this investment is a catch-up, if you will, in terms of the revenue growing so fast over the last couple of years, and it's been hard for us to catch up in terms of just being able to support the business in the way that we'd like. We're also encouraged by the growth opportunities over time, I'll call it the through cycle or normalized long-term growth, and we want to make sure the company is positioned right for that. 
 So I have more to say about how to size it. I would say that we're going to be consistent with our long-term model. We've been way ahead of the model over 50% over the last couple of years. I would expect us to be in the target range as we think about '22. Hopefully, that helps. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess a similar question on the gross margin side. As you think about your investments that you're making now, how should we think about the trajectory for gross margins into calendar '22? And I guess as part of that, would love to know mix-wise, what would enable you to hit the higher end or 64% in the December quarter as well? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, C.J., one of the challenges, all the things I mentioned, that there is a COGS component to it. And I think one of the other challenges we're facing is pressure on cost in the in the supply chain. As I think about '22, I do see an impact from incremental costs, probably somewhere in the 75 to 100 basis point level. I do think that that's implied in the guidance that we provided. I'll have a firmer point on it as I think about '22 in the next call as we start to just lay out a more comprehensive plan around the year. But I do think we're operating in the 63% range, and I'll put a little bit wider range than I normally would today. It may be set plus or minus 75 basis points on that based on our early expectations for next year. 
 Absent those pressures, I think we'd be very consistent with the kind of trajectory we've seen. Certainly, the mix is more process control centric given expectations for next year right now. But I do think we'll continue to operate within our longer-term expectations of trying to drive somewhere between 60% and 65% incremental. But certainly, these cost pressures are real out there. And we're trying to navigate our way through it. 
 But I don't think it will change much from current levels in terms -- but I don't think it's going to go up much either. So I think it's -- we're going to be operating and hovering sort of in this area with mix affecting performance in any given quarter. 
Christopher Muse: That's very helpful. As a follow-up, on the revenue guide for first half calendar '22, that implies roughly, I think, $50 million higher each quarter. And so curious, is there any seasonal impact we should be thinking about Orbotech lower in the March quarter? And otherwise, should we be thinking about really process control being the key driver of that uplift? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, it's a good question. Right now, and again, things could change, but I don't see any seasonal impact into the first quarter. I think Process Control will be above, obviously, the high single-digit commentary. So I think we'll see process control systems higher than that in terms of the first half expectations. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. 
Vivek Arya: On the first one, the industry is about to start making this transition to 3-nanometer. And I was hoping you could contrast what that move means for Process Control intensity, right, the move from 5 to 3 versus the change you saw when the industry moved from 7 to 5? And can this transition from 5 to 3 change the competitive landscape in any way? 
Richard Wallace: Well, I think -- yes, I think the -- it's a more similar change, I think, as traditional ones because EUV has already been introduced. So what you're seeing is an increase. It's less of a revolutionary one in the sense that EUV is N5, and so you're going to see expansion of EUV layers as part of 3. So in that way, I think the mix phenomena will change towards some of the higher end tools. 
 So for example, Gen 4 for us is significantly outselling Gen 5 in this calendar year because the bulk of the layers that could be done on a Gen 4 system. So as you move to 3, you're going to have more leverage towards a Gen 5 and -- now it turns out, we'll also be improving the capabilities on Gen 4. But I think you'll see it slightly shift. 
 Remember, customers are always looking at the most cost-effective inspection strategy that they can have. So you're going to see it there. It will show up in metrology as well because there'll just be more points that will have to be sampled and that will drive utilization and the throughput requirements on tools. 
 So Process Control intensity at the advanced nodes does get pushed harder, and we're definitely getting that feedback from our leading-edge customers the need for more capability and capacity to support that. So I think if anything, you're going to see a shift towards some of the higher ASP capability. At the same time, we're improving it. 
 But in terms of a KLA market share perspective, we think it's actually positive for our market share. Because most of the time, when we have competitive situations, we tend to be in price competition at the lower end of most of the competition, and this will push things towards higher end which are the tools that we're really well positioned in and that will allow us to continue to our march towards higher market share over time. 
Bren Higgins: Vivek, I could also say that in N5, you're going to have a lot of -- a high number of design starts. So you're going to see customers adding capacity in N5, which means it's much harder for them to try to migrate any of that capacity to N3. So they're going to be investing in N3, but also adding capacity in N5. So the technical drivers make that harder already based on a lot of the things that Rick just talked about, but also the design start activity, will also be a factor in that. So there's a lot of new capacity that comes in to support that node. 
Vivek Arya: Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, at the risk of pushing you a little more on the calendar '22 because you were so nice to give us what you're seeing in the first half. Usually, the second half of the year -- calendar year tends to be better than the first half. So to the extent that you have visibility, right, today based on bookings and whatnot, is there any factor that could prevent that from happening next year? 
Bren Higgins: Look, I'm not going to guide the second half, it's pretty far out. Yes, we have seen that phenomenon over the last couple of years play out. I would say in part of why we felt comfortable with the first half guidance is that we do have very high levels of backlog. And given the fact that the WFE number this year is clearly a supply number and not a demand number, there's certainly evidence of visibility through our customers and how they're lining up tools into the first half of the year. So we feel pretty comfortable about what we see there, hence, the guidance we provided and are driving the business and in particular, the capacity we have to be able to support long-term growth in the industry. So I'm not going to give you the second half, but I don't see any reason why things would fall off given the nature of what we're seeing and the demand and conversations we have from customers. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I had 2 of them. First one, Ric or Bren, it looks like your China sales have been really strong. And when I look at the industry, it looks like both you and your peers are all getting demand from a long tail of smaller customers, many of them are focused on things like IoT. So I'm kind of curious what is the split between MNC and domestic? And how durable do you think the China business from these smaller customers who seem to have cropped up recently and maybe don't have the scale, how durable do you think it is? And then I have a follow-up. 
Richard Wallace: Well, just in terms of overall percentages, I would say our Semi Process Control is pretty consistent with the overall this quarter for the company. Sometimes EPC tends to be heavier weighted to China and does pull the overall company up a little bit. But this quarter, it's pretty close. It does tend to be lumpier. So I think overall, if you look at the business, we probably expect overall China to be somewhere around in the low 20s as a percent for calendar year '21. Above that, I would say, 15% or so, maybe 20% is multinational. So 80% of that would be native. 
Bren Higgins: And the second part of that, when it comes to sustainability, these are, to your point, they're smaller scale, but they're also lagging in terms of when people would think about leading-edge technologies. They're not leading edge, they're supporting domestic demand. And if you think about the EV industry, for example, the car, there's quite a bit of activity in China around that. So they're trying to have more control over their own supply chain for those trailing edge parts. So it's actually quite sustainable when you look at the amount of demand there is for specialty semiconductors in the China market. So I think that that's something that you'll continue to see, and it's a long way away from some of the concerns people have about leading edge in China. 
Richard Wallace: I guess the final point on that also is that when you think about our business, we do have exposure to wafer into mask. And so if you look at what's going on in terms of domestic capacity for infrastructure to support the semiconductor business, we do have some exposure to that overall. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Super helpful, Rick and Bren. And then a quick follow-up. Just wanted to see what is the status on the e-beam tools? I remember last quarter, it was about 15 or so tools in the field. Can you give us a status update on that? And where do you think your market share is today on e-beams? 
Bren Higgins: Well, I don't know if things have changed all that much. I mean, certainly, we're confident in the product road map that we have for e-beam. And I think it's complementary with our optical tools. Now when we say e-beam, it's a broad term. It covers not just metrology but also inspection and review. So there's a lot of efforts that are happening across the company, including in reticle inspection. 
 But we -- our strategy around EBI, which is I think you're referring to, inspection, is really to try to leverage and use the EBI technology and the machine learning that we have to drive the inspectors and add more value or more relevancy to the inspection tools. So it's more of a portfolio strategy than a point product strategy. And I think it's going pretty consistent with our overall expectations today. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I would just add to that. I think the team has done an outstanding job of developing this capability and delivering it. We're getting very positive feedback from our customers. They really like the idea of some of the capabilities. They also like the leverage that we have between some of the algorithms we've developed in our other systems that they're familiar with being able to apply those to e-beam and also as Bren said the interoperability. 
 So where we are anticipated and planned from a revenue standpoint on these, there are really multiple applications, which we're serving with e-beam. So we feel very good. But just as an overall cautionary reminder, e-beam as a percent of optical wafer inspection continues to be right about where it's been for the last 20 years, and we know that. We're providing this capability because there are some special applications where customers need it. And there are actually some expansion opportunities in things like some of the increased demands of overlay that require more people are looking at for e-beam in order to control the very advanced design rules. 
 So it's meeting what we plan. We're happy with our execution and the market share is climbing, but it's a long haul to gain share in many of these markets, and we know that. 
Operator: We'll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore: I wonder if you could just talk about the mix this year in foundry logic seems to have shifted more to the legacy nodes a little bit or at least those are stronger than they've been. Can you talk about maybe where that mix is? I think you've given that sort of qualitative color on that in the past. And what does that do for KLA? Does that sort of a headwind for you relative to WFE? Or -- and if that rolls off, could it help you the other direction? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. No, it's interesting this year. I think last year it was a little bit more heavy in trailing edge. In '21, it's been very leading edge-centric for our business. And I think '22 probably expands a little bit more in terms of the trailing edge. So it's about 20% to 25% of our foundry revenue, I'd classify as below 28-nanometer. And so I'd call that leading edge. And so 28 and above is about 25% or so. So 75% is below 28. And I think as we go into next year, I think we'll see a little bit more of the trailing edge activities. 
Bren Higgins: One of the things that it's done for us, I mean, versus, I think, if you go back long enough, we have a Gen 5 and Gen 4 we talked about in detail. We also have different variants of BBP, which are even more suitable to some of the lower end. And those customers often are familiar with the higher-end tools, and they want some of that capability. So we're seeing that these products actually run a little bit longer than they ever had. 
 And so we have another product we call the C205, which is targeted for the auto industry, and we're able to sell that, and we're seeing that it really leverages a lot of the R&D that we've done for years. 
 So the platform, even -- we talked about a portfolio of products, but the truth is we have a portfolio of BBP products. And it is not just across the different technologies, it's one technology across the different generations. And we're really leveraging that. So what's really surprising when we look at it is that Gen 5, while it's doing quite well, it's actually one of the smaller -- relative to the Gen 4, it's significantly smaller in dollar volume this year, and that will grow over time, which makes us feel really good about the sustainability and the overall potential for us to continue to be able to invest and provide capability for our customers across all nodes. So it's pretty exciting to see. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: You talked about the increase in your manufacturing capacity, but how do we think about the ability of your supplier partners capacity to grow in order to support your growth, given some of your components, I know are several months for lead times? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. It's a great question, Joe. When I say capacity, I mean people, parts and space. So I am covering all of those things. Certainly, supply chain tends to be the longest pole in the tent, if you will, in terms of our ability to add capability. We've been doing that for a long period of time and go back to the middle of -- for the end of 2020. 
 So we have around the key components and subsystems, where there are long lead times. We have very strong partnerships with those suppliers. And we've been working with them. We've been investing where appropriate to ensure that they're able to increase their capacity. So that capacity comes online over time. Our volumes are lower around a lot of those parts. And so getting single-digit upticks sequentially quarter-to-quarter in terms of units can have a pretty big impact on the company's overall revenue. 
 So we continue to make those investments and work with those suppliers. Obviously, you never know what the future is, but we do have this belief that with semiconductor revenue growing the way it is, capital intensity rising, that this will be a demand for the company going forward. And so whether it's near term or longer term, I'm willing to make the investments to ensure that we can be as flexible and responsive to customers as we need to be. 
 We're also carrying more inventory, and that provides a little bit of extra buffer as well around some of these components. Because our volumes are where they're at, some of the more fungible or more commodity-like parts that are out there. Our challenges are probably a little less than some of the other folks out there just because I don't need as many of them. I need them, but I don't need as many of them just because of the level of volume we have. So I think it's across all those things. 
 And we feel pretty good that, look, ultimately, our customers would like things sooner if we could deliver to them, but we are managing our way through it, and I feel pretty good about the guidance that we provided here today. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. And let me just add one perspective where I think actually it differentiates KLA in a positive light relative to our peers in the industry. Because we've always been high mix, low volume, and we have several strategic relationships with key suppliers, as Bren, we've actually always been working the supply chain and making sure we invested in our suppliers so that we had capability because in many cases, where we've been for years inextricably linked to them. 
 So when this thing hit, I think we were able to navigate it better, because to Bren's point, we don't need as many. We don't need the biggest volume. And with the critical ones we've had historically strong relationships which we maintained through the different cycles. So that's why I think, again, it's another example of KLA being less volatile in a dynamic market. So that is part of it. It comes with a lot of work, a lot of hard work with our supply chain. But I think we have the trust and relationships with them that when we make commitments, we could follow through on them. 
 So it has taken work to do, but I think that's part of why we've been able to scale and we went through the whole period. We didn't stop guiding. We hit our numbers. We haven't missed our performance expectations. And I think largely, it's because of those things. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Got it. That's really helpful. And then just as a follow-up, in the prepared remarks, you talked about increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge. I was curious if you could double-click on that. And maybe also how do we think about that from a margin profile, just given it seems like maybe some of those opportunities are maybe a little bit more hands on? 
Richard Wallace: Well, I'll take the first part, and Bren can speak to the margin opportunity. I think that, as you well know, a lot of these fabs are running a lot longer than historically, some of them have relied on some version of third party or their own service. As those factories have been upgraded with more recent KLA technology, it's really been falling on us to support that. So I give you the example of the C205 product line. That's not something that they're going to be able to readily get a third party to service or do it themselves or just wait. So we're engaging when we sell some of the newer capability into these more, I guess, traditional or trailing edge fabs, we provide more services and capability, and that's been part of the value proposition. 
 The other factor, of course, that is helpful is they're all quite profitable enterprises for our customers, so they're willing to make that investment to secure their capabilities. 
Bren Higgins: I don't think the margins are any different than other parts of the service business that we have. And look, we serve to an entitlement. We serve to what our customers purchase a certain service level, and we optimize the organization to be able to support that. Certainly, the utilization rates are higher, and so that's creating a revenue stream also the demand on that capacity in terms of not just incremental volume but also demands in terms of reliability is also increasing. And so that's creating opportunities for us to sell more capability, but also to introduce some of our newer products that have road maps and have the ability to have an upgrade stream to it. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: I guess, Bren, you gave guidance first half versus the second half of this year for the whole company. But it seems like Process Control Systems could be up like low teens first half of next year versus the second half of this year. Is that a reasonable number? 
Bren Higgins: So I said high single digits, and I would think that Process Control systems based on what we seek to do today, will be higher than the company average. 
Timothy Arcuri: Higher than the company average. Okay. Got it. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. So if it's 8-ish percent, I expect it to be higher. High single digits, right, 8%, 9% or whatever that is. So... 
Timothy Arcuri: Yes. Okay. Got it. And then on EPC, so I know that the long-term outlook is for EPC to grow double digits, but you're growing more than 20% this year, and that's kind of even before the big packaging stuff from the big guy who has this huge project has even really hit your orders yet. So can you just talk about the timing of that? And do you think that you can grow double digit next year even off this elevated level? And maybe when do you expect that big project to start to positively impact your EPC business? 
Bren Higgins: We would expect growth next year in EPC. I'm not going to get into specific sizing overall, but we are encouraged by what we're seeing here for next year. And I don't want to get into specific timing for customers. We're pretty optimistic about the opportunities that exist there and some of the product offerings that we have. So we'll have to see it play through, but I am encouraged to think it's another year of growth. I think EPC will have solid growth into next year. 
Richard Wallace: So yes, Tim, just to give a little more color on that. I do think if you thought about these big programs, they're pretty early stages. So I think by the time that it will result in significant accelerant to that growth were in 2023. So it's not really -- 2022, I think, rises with some of the industry and programs and partnerships that we already have, '23 is a result of some of the newer things that are being worked on now. And I've mentioned before and we've talked, we are very excited about what we're hearing and seeing in terms of both the opportunity and the desire for these bigger players to engage with KLA. So -- but that's not as much a '22 as it is a '23 phenomenon. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. 
Patrick Ho: Congrats on a nice quarter. Rick, maybe first off, on a big picture basis, you're seeing a lot of changes in the DRAM industry right now from a process technology standpoint as you go to 1z and 1a. From a process control intensity standpoint, it's likely to increase. What are the biggest process challenges that you're helping customers address? Is it in new materials? Is it the deeper VS? And maybe if you could give a little color of the applications that are driving increasing intensity in DRAM. 
Richard Wallace: I think the biggest thing for what we're seeing in DRAM, and this was a question, I think, for quite a while, was EUV going to be simply for advanced logic devices, advanced foundry. And now we're seeing it, as you know, starting to happen in EUV. And everything that comes with that, all the infrastructure that goes with that, all the work that's going to go on to make sure that you can qualify the reticles, even though they have redundancy, there's a huge fear of throwing away. This is a very expensive infrastructure. So there's a lot of work going on already with Gen 5 to make sure that we can help qualify. 
 And of course, you mentioned the high aspect ratio devices, you're going to see more -- I think, they've been in a honeymoon period for actually several years, I would say that some of the DRAMs historically, and you didn't see the Process Control intensity grow. This is a real chance for it to increase as a result of the new capabilities that are bringing -- just EUV, what that brings on. You also have a lot of metrology applications as well. 
 So I think we do see it broadly. I don't think it will ever get to the levels of Process Control intensity we see in leading-edge foundry logic, but it will increase probably at a faster rate in terms of growth of process control as we go forward. Assuming the successful deployment of EUV, which right now is certainly what they're working on. 
 Just one example of that is in what we're hearing now is for DRAM is that there seems to be no pellicle is going to be used in the lithography. That's the belief right now. And if so, that puts a lot of pressure on print check, which is a very high intensity application for Gen 5. So there would be an example of a new application. I can't remember -- I can vaguely remember, but it wasn't in any decades since we've been doing it on a print check in DRAM. So this would be a whole new application for those customers. 
 And as you know, some of them have experienced in advanced logic, so they know what that means. At least one of them does. So there's going to be some crossover from that. So we're feeling pretty good about where that's coming in terms of shaping up for yet another driver for intensity. 
Patrick Ho: Great. And just as a quick follow-up, maybe for Bren. You guys have been posting really strong services revenues, which is not a surprise. Do you believe any of this incremental pickup in services is related to, I guess the shortage situation with chips, it's driving probably higher utilization rates and probably the need to keep these tools running. Do you feel like any of this incremental pickup in services is related to the current market situation involved with semiconductors? 
Bren Higgins: Sure, sure. That's driving the higher utilization rates. So that's certainly a factor. One of the -- also the large factors you're starting to see tools that were shipped in '20 as we've seen that the systems business grow and ramp that those tools are coming out of warranty now as we move into the second half of '21. And so that is also a driver of incremental service revenue. 
 I think that contract penetration has been good in this environment. Customers rely on us to keep their capacity up. And so we've also seen some incremental benefit of -- from a contract renewal point of view. So I think there's a number of factors that are driving it. 
Operator: And we'll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick follow-up for the team. Your December quarter revenue implies a wide range, up 7% to 16%. I would like to hear what are the key variables that would drive the low end versus the high end. 
Bren Higgins: Mehdi, it's Bren. So our typical revenue guidance range is plus or minus $100 million. And typically for that, it tends for us to be more about, look, we have very large integer tools. We can have systems that can cost upwards of $40 million apiece. And so at times, depending on dynamics around supply chain, the dynamics around customer readiness and in some cases, you have to go to customer accepting -- their customer acceptance. So there are always those factors that influence our -- where we could land in a certain range. 
 So our range has been very consistent over the last several quarters. I don't think anything's really changed on that front. It really gets down to our assessment of where we're at. In some cases, we have evaluations, consignments that have to be bought out. So there's always some fluidity to our expectations in our revenue plan as we build it up. But I wouldn't say that there's any one issue or another that is driving how we're thinking about the overall range. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. That's fair. And then one quick follow-up on WFE. Given your view on the first half of calendar year '22, it seems to me that your share gain could be in the 50 to 100 basis point, and you're not providing absolute dollar value of WFE. But if I just take your commentary, it seems like a minimum of 50 basis point share gain is actually very conservative. Do you have anything you can share with me? 
Bren Higgins: Well, we feel very good about the relative performance this year and to our prepared remarks, also next year. When we were at our Investor Day in New York back in 2019, we laid out a plan that we thought that would drive KLA's share of WFE up 75 to 100 basis points between 2019 and 2023. Part of that was market share gain, part of it we thought were intensity opportunities related to the introduction of some new products. So we feel pretty good about the trajectory we're on. 
 I don't want to provide a specific number there. But our goal is to hit our plan, and I feel pretty good about where we are relative to that plan. 
Kevin Kessel: Operator, we have time, it looks like, for one last question. 
Operator: Okay. Our final question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. [ EVG ] adoption continues at a pretty aggressive pace in using mass layer accounts continue to expand with every new technology node. And then additionally, you have the one large logic customer that is now back on an aggressive technology cadence, leveraging EV. So how are you guys thinking about the growth of your reticle inspection business relative to overall Process Control for this year? And how are you thinking about reticle inspection growth into next year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. When I look at reticle inspection, I think it's a market growth kind of number this year, probably will be a record for us this year. And -- but I think on a go-forward basis, you're right, the introduction of EUV and increasing layer counts are driving growth in that overall market. As you know, we support that market with multiple products that help optimize for our customers to optimize around some of the technology challenges but also the economic objectives that they have. 
 So I do think that there's an inflection in that market. We've seen nice performance this year, and we expect to see it continue to grow over the next few years. 
Harlan Sur: Yes. I appreciate that. And then one of the big growth drivers for next year in terms of WFE is more of these mature and specialty nodes and you guys talked a bit about it. But I think the team actually did recently introduce 4 or 5 new tools which are primarily focused on mature and specialty inspection and metrology, like the C205 broadband plasma inspection platform. Can you guys just give us a sense of early adoption curve? What's the differentiation of these tools versus customers just buying like refurbished older-generation KLA tools? 
Richard Wallace: Sure, Harlan. I mean I think that there was, I think, historically, a view of trying to leverage the older technology. But as you can imagine, those tools are quite aged at this point. So we definitely saw a step-up, plus it was harder for us to service it. So we're seeing a lot more capability we can offer now in some of these -- and I'd say the C205 is like a derivative tool of the BBP tool. So that's one where you get a lot of capability and certainly take advantage of all the work we've done in the algorithm area. 
 And so we can offer it a lower cost because of the configuration and all that, but it has a lot of capabilities. So we're seeing much more interest in newer capability. And remember, these guys are getting pushed very hard by their supply chain, especially in automotive because there's such a focus on preventing some of the defects, reliability issues. As you know, those are incredibly expensive if they're caught later. So we're seeing pretty good adoption and growth. And it's kind of a little bit countered overall WFE's cyclicality. So we think that is a steady area of investment. 
 What we laid out at the Investment Day, 100 years ago, it feels like 2019, we're still on track, actually ahead of plan for that in terms of automotive. And we anticipated bringing on some of these products at that time. 
Harlan Sur: And I assume that you're getting, what higher dollar capture value for these new tools relative to, let's say, purchasing a refurbished tool? 
Richard Wallace: Oh, much higher. And I think it's just -- it's a better deal, frankly, for everybody. I mean the capability of the software, they can do more with them. We can service them more effectively, have a longer life. I think, a lot of upside for them to do that. In fact, in many of these older fabs, this might be the one area where they are bringing in new capability. 
Kevin Kessel: And thank you, everybody, for your time. This will conclude the call. I'll pass it back to the operator for any final instructions. 
Operator: And this concludes the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2021 (sic) [ 2022 ] Earnings Call and Webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-07-30 17:00:00) =====

Rick Wallace: Hello, and thank you for joining us today. The June 2021 quarter showed continued momentum and strength for KLA. We delivered on our top and bottom-line goals and progressed against our long-term strategic objectives. Specifically, quarterly revenue grew 7% sequentially and 32% year-over-year to $1.95 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.43, representing 15% sequential growth and 63% growth compared to the prior year. These results demonstrate strong growth momentum in our core markets and the operating leverage in the KLA model. We continue to see increased customer demand across each of our major product groups. This demand is related to ongoing secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investments to address these growth markets and investing in their leading-edge R&D efforts. Against the strong demand backdrop, we are navigating evolving customer needs and persistent supply chain challenges. Still, KLA continues to outperform expectations by operating the purpose and precision, and focusing on creating value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. This strong execution is led by our talented global teams, continuing to go above and beyond, constantly rising to the challenge and opportunities of the marketplace. I will quickly summarize our view of the industry demand environment. We're in a great position relative to growth drivers that are creating momentum for the industry and our business. As a result, our outlook for the wafer fab equipment industry continues to move higher. We have increased our growth estimate from low to mid-20s stated last quarter to the low to mid-30s on a percentage basis. This is from a base of approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020. With strong secular semiconductor demand trends continuing, we expect positive industry dynamics to sustain into calendar 2022. As our business benefits from this increased demand and our customers are also investing in leading-edge development, fab optimization, and regional expansion, KLA offers a leading portfolio of products to solve our customer's challenges. We continue to invest in high levels of R&D to ensure we are constantly improving and remaining indispensable to our customers. Specifically, we are prioritizing investment in artificial intelligence and machine learning. KLA's unique capabilities and leveraging these technologies in our product and service offerings help drive adoption, differentiates KLA against the competition. KLA benefits from long-standing market leadership and high levels of investment in advanced laser, sensor, optics, and data analytics technologies that leverage our AI and ML capabilities to identify critical defects in the production process and deliver ever-increasing precision in metrology applications. This investment helps our product and service offerings to deliver best-in-class performance, lower process variability, higher yields, improve time to market, and reduce cost of ownership for our customers. Our growing R&D investment is happening as process control intensity is increasing, KLA's market leadership in the process control market remains greater than 4 times the nearest competitor, as reported by Gartner Research in April of 2021. KLA's sustained performance of process control is augmented by a broader position when -- within the electronics ecosystem through our Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC businesses, and the contributions of our large and growing services business. For new and long-time KLA investors, it's essential to point out the KLA's market leadership is a result of consistent and focused execution of our company's differentiated strategy. With this favorable backdrop and our strong execution, we're on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. Let's now move along to the top highlights for our most recent quarter. First, KLA continues to execute well and outperform expectations. In foundry and logic, we see simultaneous investments across multiple nodes and our customers continue to increase demand forecast. We remain encouraged by the breadth and consistency of investment across our customer base. In memory, demand is strong and spread across a broader set of customers. During the quarter, we announced four new products targeting the automotive semiconductor market, including patterned and unpartnered wafer inspection and in-line test solutions. KLA's automotive solution is aimed to help customers identify and mitigate potential reliability defects in the development and manufacturing of automotive semiconductors early in the manufacturing process, improving device reliability and driving significant value for our customers. Second, KLA's strong market leadership in optical pattern wafer inspection has helped to drive strong relative growth for our semiconductor process control segment in 2021. In fact, optical pattern wafer inspection is forecasted to be among the fastest-growing segments of WFE in 2021, for product segments over $1 billion of revenue and is poised to outpace the overall industry growth by a factor of 2 times this year. This follows similar growth and outperformance in 2020. Third, KLA's flagship reticle inspection business is on pace for a record year in 2021, growing faster than the market and growing our leadership position. As proof of that, we estimate that nearly all the reticles today at 5-nanometer are inspected by KLA systems. Our next-generation EBM-based 8xx [ph] mask inspection platform shipped last quarter and has begun customer qualification for applications at 3-nanometer and below. Fourth, our services revenue was $444 million in the June quarter or 23% of total sales, 75% of services revenue in our semiconductor process control segment and more than 90% of services revenue in our printed circuit board business is from recurring subscription-based contracts. We believe these are among the highest subscription service rates in the industry. Services business is on track for another year of strong double-digit growth, well above our long-term growth model target. The growth is driven by our expanding installed base, higher utilization rates, and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semiconductor process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the growth of the installed base, approximately 2.8 times faster from 2016 through 2020. KLA service business has the advantage of always working in close collaboration with our customers and partners, driving innovation and new initiatives for growth. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, today, we announce that KLA's Board of Directors approved a 17% increase in the company's quarterly dividend level from $0.90 to $1.05 per share. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase in our dividend level, which has grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% since inception in 2006. In addition, we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, targeted for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. We believe KLA's track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before moving into the financial highlights, let's briefly summarize a few key points. KLA's June quarter results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA's products and services in enabling the digital transformation of our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding customer requirements that balance sensitivity and throughput. The semiconductor and electronics landscape are constantly changing, and we're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. KLA also delivers enduring value through our commitment to corporate stewardship. We look forward to sharing an update on our ESG vision in our global impact report, which will be released in the coming weeks. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA's June quarter '21 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs in a robust demand environment while expanding market leadership, growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow, and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the June quarter was $1.93 billion towards the top end of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62%, at the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.43, above the guided range of $3.47 to $4.35. GAAP EPS was $4.10. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $419 million, about $7 million higher than expected primarily due to engineering materials timing and adjustments to variable compensation programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses included $241 million of R&D expense and $178 million of SG&A. At KLA, technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A was $44 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. KLA innovation is fundamental to our go-to-market strategy focused on differentiated solutions. R&D is at the heart of KLA remains a key element in driving our portfolio strategy and product differentiation. This in turn help sustain our technology and market leadership. Non-GAAP operating income was very strong at 40%. Given higher revenue expectations for the second half of '21, product development requirements, ongoing regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our global infrastructure due to overall business volume, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million in the September quarter. Going forward, we will continue to size the company based on our target operating model which delivers 40% to 50% incremental operating margin leverage on revenue growth over a multi-quarter horizon. Other income and expense in the June quarter net was $11 million, reflecting the gain on an investment in a strategic supplier that recently completed its initial public offering. This gain represented $0.15 of earnings per share at the company's tax planning rate of 13.5%. You should continue to model other income and expense net at approximately $43 million per quarter. The quarterly adjusted effective tax rate was 10.4%, reflecting the benefit of favorable audit adjustments recognized in the period. Non-GAAP net income was $684 million, GAAP net income was $633 million, cash flow from operations was $466 million, and free cash flow was $410 million. The company had approximately 154 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at quarter-end. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.581 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 5% and also up 37% compared to June of last year. The approximate semiconductor process control customer segment mix was in line with our forecast from April as foundry logic was 68% and memory was 32%. In memory, the business was split roughly 34% NAND and 66% DRAM. Revenue for our Electronics, Packaging, and Components Group hit a record in the quarter driven by continued strength in 5G mobile and infrastructure, as well as rising demand in automotive. More specifically, the specialty semiconductor process segment generated revenue of $98 million, up 7% sequentially and down 2% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was mostly driven by growth in the automotive power semiconductor applications, where we have a leading position in edge and deposition products. Specialty semiconductor process's performance was also highlighted by the second straight quarter of record bookings. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $247 million, up 20% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year with the data center driving strength in advanced PCB and packaging inspection. KLA ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total cash, total debt of almost $3.5 billion, and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. We were also pleased to see Moody's upgrade our debt rating in early June to A2 from Baa1, further underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and sustainability of our business and financial performance. We have tremendous confidence in our business over the long run and are committed to a long-term strategy of cash returns to shareholders, executing the balanced approach split between dividends and share repurchases, targeting long-term returns that at least 70% of free cash flow generated. Our announcement today of our 12th consecutive annual increase in the dividend and additional share repurchase authorization are representative of our explicit approach and strong track record of predictable and productive capital deployment. Over the last 12 months, KLA returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $559 million in dividends paid and $939 million in share repurchases. While circumstances can change, our current expectation remains that our capital returns for calendar '21 will exceed 85% of expected free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion, and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. During the quarter, we generated $410 million of free cash flow and repurchased $300 million of common stock, while also paying $139 million in dividends. Our overall semiconductor demand and WFE outlook continues to increase from our views earlier in the year. At the start of this year, we characterized the expected growth of the WFE market to be in the low teens plus or minus a few percentage points. In April, we revised that view to the low to mid-20s on a percentage basis with a bias to the upside. Today, we see further improvement and expect the WFE market to grow in the low to mid-30s from approximately $61 billion in calendar 2020 to approximately $81 billion at the midpoint in calendar '21. This reflects the broad-based strengthening of demand across all customer segments. KLA is in position to deliver strong relative growth this year, driven by our market leadership and strong momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms, in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups. Looking ahead, we remain encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile. As a result, we continue to expect total company revenue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year. We also expect the second half of calendar '21 to grow in the mid-teens on a percentage basis versus the first half, as more of our manufacturing capacity comes online to support the strong customer demand. Furthermore, our system shipment expectations point to meaningful growth in semiconductor process control equipment systems in the second half of calendar '21. This strong backdrop supports our current expectations of high-30s to low-40s year-over-year percentage growth for the semiconductor process control systems business in calendar '21. As a result, we continue to believe that this business is positioned to outperform in '21 relative to the overall WFE market. Our September quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be in a range $2.02 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 59%, and memory is expected to be approximately 41% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.5% to 63.5%. At the midpoint, this is 50 basis points above the June quarter level due principally to product mix. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business across products and business segments will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends both in terms of product cost, manufacturing efficiency, and product positioning remain compelling and are sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions for September include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $430 million, other income and expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective adjusted tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.76 to $4.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $4.01 the $4.89. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 153.5 million shares. In closing, the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with broad-based customer demand and simultaneous investments across multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the leading indicators for our business, including our backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters. Our customer's multiyear investment plans also point to the stability of demand in the future. KLA continues to execute well and is on track to exceed our 2023 financial targets well ahead of expectations. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our important strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence, and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong financial performance, and long-standing track record of free cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders. And with, that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A.
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Britney, can you please queue up for questions?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. EUV adoption continues strong. And if I look at the outlook for EUV Litho systems expected to grow like mid-30% this year. Do you have a positive exposure here via your wafer inspection systems, but also the strong leadership in EUV mask inspection and printed. I know this doesn't represent your entire process control business, but it's sort of a good proxy. But you guys are guiding your optical inspection, your mask inspection, and your overall process control business to go well above that range. So, what are the two or three dynamics that are driving the strength above EUV adoption? And more importantly, with the visibility that you guys have, how are you feeling about the sustainability of the overall second-half momentum into the first half of next calendar year?
Rick Wallace: Hey Harlan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. You're right. I think we are seeing a lot of strength in the process control portfolio driven. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we look at optical wafer inspection and really seeing a lot of uptake on that. What's interesting about that is, it's a pretty good mix between Gen 4 and Gen 5. So, both of the -- Gen 5 is more exposed, I would say to the EUV dynamic, but we're seeing more proliferation of Gen 4 also as people continue to add advanced capability. And we expected that with the rising complexity really across the board, and it's not just in the EUV areas of memory, logic, foundry, but also we're seeing it in memory; that's one area. We mentioned also reticles having a really strong year as the number of advanced designs continue. So, we're seeing both related to EUV, but also just increased process control intensity really across the entire portfolio. That's why we feel so strongly about the remainder of the year. And as Bren indicated, we're looking into 2022 for that strength to continue. Bren, you want to provide more color?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So, as Rick said, I think as we continue through the second half of this year, both those businesses are growing faster than market as we said in the prepared remarks. In fact, I would think that the optical inspection business is one of the fastest-growing markets in all of WFE, if not the fastest. So, there's a lot of inflections around EUV, but also other process dynamics that are driving that. But the introduction of EUV driving shrinks in the business or shrinks in design rules is creating an opportunity for both platforms and also leveraging optical inspection for validating reticle quality. Also 5-nanometer in the reticle part of the business, you also have increasing reticle complexity. And our offering in that market after a number of years where reticle complexity wasn't changed all that much in the double patterning environment. As we move to EUV, reticle complexity is changing dramatically. And our offering is a more technical offering and we're getting strong customer interest in that product. So, I think there's sustainable tailwinds here through the rest of this year and as we move into '22.
Harlan Sur: I appreciate that. And then on the gross margin front, if you could just help us understand the upticking in our gross margins into the September quarter. It looks like component costs are rising, I'm assuming the team also has to pay expedite fees for some parts and your end market mix is more weighted towards memory, which I would think would have some slight negative bias on gross margins. So, it's great to see the team driving the margin profile higher, but just help us understand some of the drivers of that?
Rick Wallace: Customer mix doesn't impact our margin profile, our products across all segments have the same margin profile. So, it really is a mix dynamic that is driving the quarter-to-quarter, 50 basis point increase we have. Most of the growth quarter-to-quarter is coming from semi-process control systems and those carry higher margins than obviously our service business or EPC business. So, that's been the bigger driver. We have supply chain challenges like everybody else and we're constantly trying to manage our way through those. Freight costs are higher, those are embedded. And maybe over time as some of those pressures alleviate, we'll get a little bit of benefit from that into the future. But we certainly have that in our numbers and expecting it to remain at that level over the next couple of quarters. On the component side, there is pressure on components, there is pressure on raw materials for frames and steel specifically, for the frames of our tools. So, we're dealing with that. Labor pressures are different around the world, we have factories in different locations but we're also dealing with that as well. I would expect as we move forward, we'll see some pressure. So, far it's been offset by the strength of the volume. So, we worked with our suppliers and the volume upside has been favorable. But I do expect we'll see some pressure on components. The way we price products tends to be value-centric. We have a value pricing model, not a cost-based model. But we're certainly going to have to deal with that as it comes through. With these revenue levels into the future, I would think we're probably looking at 10 to 20 basis points type of impact over time from some of the inflationary pressures on our COGS. But that's contemplated in the guidance we provided in terms of our margin expectations moving forward.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Thanks, Rick, Bren. Congratulation on the strong quarter. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Rick, I wanted to go back to your prepared comments about the investments that you're making in AI and ML. I mean clearly, some of your peers have talked about big investments in that area. I'd be curious if you can help us understand how you think you might differ from theirs? How -- maybe your incompetency [ph] gives you an upper hand here. And as you think about this, is this a way to maintain already outstanding share? Or do you think there is actually incremental revenue and SAM capability as you bring this out? And Bren, maybe on the gross margin; what could be the influence to gross margin? I'm assuming this is mainly software IP, which -- would it seem to be gross margin accretive?
Rick Wallace: John, thanks for the question. We've been working on what has been -- what is now called AI and ML for years now. And of course, because we handle so much data in our systems, especially in optical wafer system but also in the reticle system, that we've been having to manage that data and look for a signal in that data for a long time. What ML enables and machine learning enables along with AI is, just extracting more information out of that data. So, as we continue to have more capability to manage it, our work on AI has proliferated across most of our products now in some form or another but we continue to add upgrades. So, I think to answer your question, one way to think about it is we can squeeze more capability out of existing generations by leveraging the algorithms in the AI work. And in the past, where we may have needed to shift [ph] wavelengths for example to get more capability, we can do that with algorithm. So, one of the questions that had been brought up in the past was, for example, the limitations of optical wafer inspection and why EBM was going to maybe take a large prior of the share, that was the thesis a few years ago. But it was through AI and through ML and our advanced optics capability, that we've actually created additional node capability out of the optical systems. So, I think that's another way that we've expanded and lengthened the lifetime of the products, part of why Gen 4 has a longer life now is, we're squeezing more capability out of that, leveraging it. To answer your other question, it is expanding into our other products, those are the first really in the work we do at reticle. But it's also driving some opportunities for us in other segments as we expand the leverage of that capability into both metrology but also some of our traditionally lower-end wafer inspection systems that are applying and trailing edge capability [ph]. So, it's really kind of across the board. And you're right, it's very -- if you can amortize the engineering the way we do, it's pretty accretive to the overall business volume, because you're -- we do make a large investment. We're by far -- we have the most investment going on, no question among our peers because we're doing it across such a broad portfolio. But we're getting leverage as we have multiple products that are leveraging it. So, Bren can speak to how that drives the P&L.
Bren Higgins: Yes, John. And I think it's much more of an operating margin statement or a reduction in R&D intensity is another way to about it. Platform extendability is one of the biggest decisions we make in our product lifecycle processes. We're making choices and we can extend platforms. It means that over time we get a higher return on investment on those engineering dollars. So we don't have to go develop the next one, which is what drives significant cost of the model as you're developing and bringing a new product to market. So, by extending it, we see the leverage in our operating margins. Now, in terms of gross margin, software content or software offerings are increasing across the whole company not just within semi-process control, where we have businesses. Now that are starting to get to meaningful revenue levels, but we're selling software directly and we have that there, and we also have it in the EPC business where we're providing simulation capabilities, data analytics, other computational methods, design-based capabilities to help point our inspectors and get more value out of the KLA offerings. So, there is a few dynamics that are there that I think are good for us in terms of solving some of these problems as technology roadmaps get more and more complicated, but then also driving operating margin leverage over time.
John Pitzer: Thank you very much.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, John.
Operator: And we will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.
CJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. As you think about your implied revenue guide for December, it looks like it's about $250 million of process control. And it sounds like that is coming on, based on new manufacturing capabilities that you're bringing online. So curious, what's the impact to gross margins at that time frame? And will that satisfy all pent-up demand? Or will your lead times still be extended heading into calendar '22?
Rick Wallace: Yes, CJ. It's a great question. As far as lead times go, I think lead times are holding pretty flat. One of the challenges and we had hoped that we'd start to see those pull in a bit, but demand has continued to increase. So we're seeing stronger demand and we're doing a lot of work to add capacity, so things are extending out, but they're not necessarily pulling in either. Yes, based on our comments, you do have a ramp in our -- in semi-process control equipment into the December quarter, that's a richer mix. So, I'm not going to guide December but that should carry a richer gross margin profile, given the nature of the products that we're shipping. That capacity has come online, that's a revenue recognition dynamics related to new facilities and product transitions that's pushing some of those shipments if you will that are happening this quarter that will happen next quarter. So, that's also part of the higher sequential growth that we're seeing into the December quarter. Did I answer your questions?
CJ Muse: Yes, that's great. If I could just sneak a second one in. As you think about your foundry logic outlook for 2022 and you talked about continued strength, I was hoping you could speak to perhaps any changes that you see in the landscape whether leading-edge, lagging-edge, EUV adoption, DRAM anything we should be thinking about portfolio wise that could be a little different than 2021?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Really, I think just in terms of overall sustainability, we would expect to see the leading edge continue to invest as we go into next year. And given the public statements that have been made there, I think that's pretty consistent with what we're seeing. On the trailing edge side, we are seeing orders that are coming into backlog, but also in the funnel from a number of customers and much more meaningful levels of customers that haven't invested all that much in the past and are addressing some of these automotive and industrial, and some of these other more trailing edge challenges. So, I would think from a shipment and revenue point of view, we'll see that business actually start to come to the P&L as we move into 2022. China has been mostly logic-centric this year, native China. And so, I think we'll have to see how that plays out as we move into next year in terms of growth. Certainly, there is -- I think sustainability with the business levels that have been elevating through this year but I would expect to see a little bit more memory activity probably next year in China. And I think that's probably the one area we don't have as much visibility in terms of logic growth there. So, I think those are the dynamics and how they're planned. I think in terms of DRAM and NAND, I would expect those to continue to maintain the momentum that we've been seeing through '21.
Bren Higgins: But CJ, I mean, just one thing to add, a lot of the business that we're booking now is revenue in '22. I mean that's part of our confidence in '22. We're filled out for '21. And so, that's part of what we're seeing. And then some of the players you know who are trying to regain the lead, a lot of that investment hasn't really shown up in our revenue numbers yet.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results. I had two of them. First one for Rick or Bren. I do want to have the December quarter question a different way, you said your semi-process control should grow 40% this year, and a half or half is mid-teens growth. So, if I look at that, it looks like December quarter is around $2.3 billion, give or take. Is that a decent proxy for December revenues? And are you not seeing any impact from any of the component shortages that's affecting some of your friends in the industry? And then I had a follow-up.
Rick Wallace: Yes. So I'm not going to guide December specifically. What we're trying to do is give you some perspective on our expectations for growth of semiconductor process control equipment for the year, that was the high '30s to low 40 statement. We also talked about the total company growing mid-teens half to half, and so that was another statement there as well. So, I don't want to put a point out there in terms of the revenue guide but hopefully, you can get there with the details we have provided. Components are a daily challenge, we are managing across our factories, across our teams, managing our suppliers to be able to deliver the parts that we need. Some components have intrinsic lead times for us that are long term, and so, we have to make decisions and we've been making decisions to make investments or for that to make commitments to those suppliers to be able to provide that supply for us as we move into '22. So, it's a challenge, we're working our way through it. I'm spending more time -- I've been with KLA for 21 years and I'm spending more time on supply chain than I ever have. And certainly, as a CFO since 2013; so, we're dealing with it. We're making our way through it, and the guidance and context we provided contemplates what we expect to happen. It's our best expectations based on what we know today.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Bren. And then, just as a follow-up, I do got a question on China. Obviously, you had really strong sales there in the June quarter. And if I try to back out, your ex-China sales had actually declined from March to June. And you also said China is mostly logic, so I'm kind of curious, are there that many logic foundry players in China? Or is this just a long tail of smaller players buying equipment? And any kind of color you can give on China with regards to your sales and any kind of split between domestic and MNCs would be very helpful. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Yes. You have to remember that when we just talk about our mix of business that's the total company, so that includes EPC. So, I believe, our China percentage was like 32%. If you looked at the native investment as a percent of our semiconductor process control segment, it's about 25%. So, the numbers, when you're extrapolating like that can lead you to different conclusions. There are a number of small projects that are logic-centric projects in China that are targeting specific markets around IoT and image sensors, and a bunch of those kinds of opportunity is obviously, automotive and industrial. So, I think there are new projects in a lot of cases which are going to be coming online over time. But there is a lot of activity there. So, yes, there are.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about -- you mentioned having new products for the automotive sector. And how are you thinking about this, you sort of see the older foundry nodes, looks like it's going to be a source of sustainable strength for a while. Can you actually target that business a little bit more directly than you have? And just generally, what kind of activity are you seeing in the older foundry nodes?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Sure, Joseph. We've actually been engaged for quite a while with some of the leading automotive -- even the automotive customers coming to us asking us to help them with their suppliers. That's been going on for a few years. What's really happened now is, it's broadened, the number of customers that are recognizing and of course the shortage of automotive semiconductors contributed to that. So, we've been developing products that have, I would say, are adaptations of existing products that provide additional capability in support of automotive, whereas you know, they're looking for more reliability, there is some cases where we're helping traceability in terms of how they're driving those fabs. So, yes, that's an area we outlined in our 2019 Analyst Day where we talked about, that was a growth area for us and we believe it continues to be. Obviously, it was a rough start to 2020 where a lot of customers shut down their plants for automotive semiconductor now to their dismay, but those are back on. And so, we do have those products, we're engaging with customers, and there is a strong demand for that, and we think that's sustainable and we think that will continue to grow as more of the automotive players see the value in that and that will just continue to broaden. So, we have a segment and a work area that we're focused on that and it's also where our business that we got through, Orbotech, SPTS works also some of the process capability there. So, it's more than just inspection, it's broader for us than that. So, it's pretty exciting. It's a good growth area and I think it's one that we'll continue to see progress over the next several quarters.
Joseph Moore: Thank you very much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Curious on your advanced packaging. You recently talked about packaging becoming more like front-end. I was curious you know, how would you compare maybe contrast the two in terms of just the increasing capital intensity. And then maybe can you touch on your position in front-end and how that maybe drive differentiation for the packaging?
Rick Wallace: Joe, I think there's a couple of things. One is, as more of the big players are focused on packaging as a source of either maintaining differentiation or closing a differentiation gap, there is more investment with larger players that know KLA. And frankly, I think we're getting more seats at the table and engagements with them because of their knowledge of KLA and their desire to put their best behind a proven player. So, we have the capability. We have some products. We're doing some product developments, some product adaptations in support of that, but the technology there is moving. The process control intensity is significantly lower than it is of course in the leading edge, but the rate of growth is very fast, the rate of growth of process control. So, I would say, we have an abundance of opportunities there to execute on, but it will require us to bring new capabilities. And so, we're engaging with our customers in that. And I can tell you, we're getting as much pool there as we are in the front end for capabilities as customers try to accelerate their roadmap. So, we're seeing strong growth as we increase the process control intensity and it's not just process control, once again some of the process equipment we have with SPTS is also being leveraged in that area as well as in our PCB business, which isn't all inspection and measurement. So, we do see strong growth. We see a lot of potential consistent with the plans we laid out in 2019 at our Investor Day.
Bren Higgins: You also have the integration of the PCB board to IC substrate into the package and so that's a good driver for us moving forward. We're working on new capability to better address that market. We also -- the ICOS' finished component inspection business is inspecting the packages, so that complexity is also driving an inflection in that market. We're seeing very strong growth in that market as well. Probably the fastest-growing part of EPC is today is through ICOS. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities as Rick said and some of it's dependent on us bringing new capability to market. But certainly, customers are trying to leverage the different positions we have across a number of different applications, trying to leverage the relationship with us to do more there.
Rick Wallace: Yes. And just to put a number on it, we said $400 million in 2019. We're ahead of plan and we can beat that, do more than that with some of the developments we're contemplating. So, I think we've got the products now to perform to that and we can do more. And we're getting encouraged by the signs that we're seeing and engaging with these customers.
Joe Quatrochi: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. Rick, maybe first off, big picture, kind of the long-term outlook for the process control industry and your positioning gate-all-around [ph] is becoming or it will be coming on board in the next few years. And I know you probably are working with your customers. You've got an incremental benefit when the industry transitions to FinFET transistors. How do you see the incremental opportunities as you go to gate-all-around where not only are you seeing new materials but more materials in that transistor area.
Rick Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. And as you know, with all our business, any of these technology transitions, inflections present opportunity for process control, because the first thing that our customers need to figure out is how to get the process ramped. So, I think we're seeing advanced indicators that that's going to be great for adoption of additional capability. It's also where the portfolio really matters, because in the case of gate-all-around, adaptation to the Gen 4 wafer inspection in some ways is more important than what Gen 5 does. Gen 5 is very important for the smaller defectivity that we need to detect and the lower rates but Gen 4 for the contrast. And so, some of the development we've been doing with our customers has been to tune our products for that advanced transistor capability. So, I think that what you'll see is a continued increase in process control intensity. The way we modeled it is relatively modest over the long term but of course, the cumulative effect is it adds up and that's why we think process control intensity outgrows WFE on the order of half a percentage point if we're going from 15 to 15.5 depending on what the aggregate, that's a blended between logic and memory. But we'll see it over time that you'll see it creep up as a result of those new inflections, provided we have the products to support it, which is a lot of the work that we've been doing. So, we feel like we're really good position to support our customers to do that.
Patrick Ho: Great, that's helpful. And my follow-up question may be for you, Bren, in terms of the investments you're making. We talked about systems, picking up expanding capacity, bringing people on board to meet the increased shipments. Services are also growing quite rapidly and you've mentioned that, it's growing faster than the target CAGR you are looking at. What are the types of investments you need to make in services given that not only is your semi services growing as the installed base grows, but PCB tends to be a very service-intensive business as well. And that marketplace is also showing signs of some more secular growth trend given some of the marketplaces that they penetrated. How do you look at service investments, both near term and over the next few years?
Bren Higgins: That's a great question. And certainly trying to get more leverage out of the service business is of the acquired companies. Acquired businesses for KLA has been one of our parts -- a key component of the investment thesis when we look at these kinds of transactions. And smaller companies have a hard time trying to have the infrastructure just given the nature of their size to be able to support a broad service footprint. So, being able to leverage our infrastructure now the go-to-market is different, how we engage with those customers is different. So, leveraging the infrastructure we have is I think a big part of that so there is a big cost element. We made the investments, I think we need to make. Certainly, China and the investments we made back in 2016 and 2017 to build infrastructure to support the China business is great for us now and we're seeing scale on that. With some of the regionalization dynamics that are out there, if we see new fabs popping up, we have to build that capability in some new places. We think those are great opportunities for us because our customers rely on us to help bring those kinds of facilities up and to bring our capability to help them do that. And so, whenever they're building a new fab in a new geography, it creates a big opportunity for KLA. We're working on remote diagnostics, remote capabilities, so we can do a lot more diagnostic, these diagnosis tool problems from back here from the factory or from our development teams depending on what's happening. One of the challenges in COVID obviously, has been getting people in and out when we have an escalation situation. So, I think those are the kinds of areas that we're investing and it's a great opportunity for us just in terms of growth given the strength of the WFE, but also the lengthening of lifetime on the tools and how customers are using them from a utilization point of view.
Rick Wallace: Yes. And then, the biggest investment really right now is in the workforce to support that. And so, as Bren mentioned, we're working on that. I think that hiring, training, on-boarding as we anticipate the continued growth is an area we've done well with. But as you know, there is a big demand for talent out there. So, we have to keep on it, keep hiring and doing that training. So, that's probably the biggest area of investment, over time that's going to be the workforce.
Patrick Ho: Great, thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I had two clarifications, Bren. And then I had a real question. The first two clarifications are, the comment you made about 15% half-on-half, that was a corporate revenue comment. Somebody attach that to a process control systems, but I don't think -- I think your process control systems comment was up like mid-30, high-30s to 40% for the year. That half-on-half comment was a corporate revenue comment. Correct?
Bren Higgins: That's correct, yes. And I attempted to clarify that in one of the earlier questions. But yes, you're right. That's the total company aggregate revenue expectation second half versus first half, mid-teens.
Timothy Arcuri: Perfect. And then the second clarification, did you say that domestic China is 25% of your process control systems revenue. Because WFE, it's like 15% of total WFE.
Bren Higgins: In the quarter that we just completed.
Timothy Arcuri: Yes. Okay, got it. Okay. So for my real question, I guess. So I wanted to ask about actinic. And it's always really been Tier to high NA for EUV. Otherwise, you use the 8xx and now you have the big microprocessor maker that's now pushing more aggressively on high NA. So, are you going to accelerate your development timeline for actinic?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Tim, it's a great question. We feel confident that we will have the capability we need when it is needed for the high NA. So, I understand what your question is, we believe that with the products that we have, with the 8xx in particular, and actually the continued capability we're seeing in 6xx, we feel that we will be there when the market is needed for the high NA.
Bren Higgins: Hey, Tim, just to also clarify on the China statement. So, that's of the semiconductor process control segment, which includes the service. It was 25% of the revenue in the June quarter.
Timothy Arcuri: I see, including service. Okay, Bren. Thank you so much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious if let's say hypothetically, WFE is 90 billion or 100 billion next year, are you prepared to support that right from your capacity perspective? Or I guess a different way of asking the question is, how much additional capacity are you planning to bring online next year?
Rick Wallace: Yes Vivek, that's an interesting question. And right now, what we're trying to do is ramp up to support the customer demand that we have. And I have expectations for incremental capacity as we move forward now. I feel like these are good investments to make for us over the long run given our expectations for multi-year growth in WFE. I think given the strength of the WFE investments in some of the end market drivers that we're talking about, that we would expect to see WFE grow over the next few years, at least in line with semiconductor revenue with rising capital intensity probably faster than that. So, these investments and given the extendability of our platforms and the lifetime of our tools in terms of how we're shipping to a very broad demand environment from a technology point of view, that these are investments that are important for us in terms of just being able to support that kind of environment moving forward sort of a through cycle over time statement. But we're continuing to invest to make sure that we have the flexibility to be able to respond to our customer demand. So, I think that's -- as I look at it right now in terms of the first half of the year, in terms of expectations, hard for me to see how -- it's at least as strong as what we've seen in the second half of '21 in terms of what we see in the funnel and in our backlog in terms of how we're managing it. I don't want to make any statements much beyond that.
Bren Higgins: I think the one thing I would add is, we are cognizant of our customers' desire to get more capability sooner and we're doing everything we can to size it. But the numbers you've talked about, we have contemplated in our plans.
Vivek Arya: Maybe a quick follow-up if I can. At what point do you sense that because of all the headlines around the capacity crunch, you have players who are now trying to become foundries on their own. That there is a pull-forward of demand that at what -- what's on your dashboard to tell you that whatever you're shipping right that the utilization levels are quite high and it's not just customers scrambling to add more capacity. Like, do you track what the usage is of the equipment that you ship?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Of course, we track the usage. I mean that's a metric that we're looking at all the time. But I would back up a little bit and say that the industry actually has a self-governing mechanism in it, which is the ability of all the equipment companies to ramp to the demand. And right now, when you talk to customers, they would take more shipments I think from everyone if they could get them sooner. So, there is a natural governance. And I'm sure you've heard, ASML talk about EUV through '22. So, it's naturally governed by that. So, I don't -- I think we're in a good place for a sustained run at this point.
Kevin Kessel: Thanks for that. Britney, we have time, it looks like for one last question.
Operator: And we will take our final question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, speaking of this multiyear investment plans that you just talked about, there -- obviously, there is a lot of new fabs being announced in the past few months. When do you expect those new fab investment to start generating revenue for you? And when do you expect to start seeing those orders coming in?
Rick Wallace: Well, in a lot of cases, we're already seeing the orders, right? So, I think that customers are getting into the queue for deliveries. And in some products, deliveries could be 12 months from now. So, it's absolutely happening and customers are trying to make those commitments as they're planning for their facilities. Obviously, they plan across a lot of different types of equipment. And so, those planning cycles tend to move around a little bit. Sometimes they are also dependent on winning business and product ramps and so on. So, there's always a little bit of variability around the timing. And then of course, generally as you try to build something, there's always infrastructure and delays and pull-ins that can happen associated with just construction overall. But yes, we're absolutely seeing that demand in the backlog and certainly in the sales funnel.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great. Maybe my follow-up; it's a lot of questions on the semi process control side but, on the EPC business, is 15% growth for this year still a realistic assumption given the strength in auto and 5G? And maybe you can talk about with or without the display side of things. Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Yes. Including display, we're in the high teens for that business. So, we're seeing strength there. Display is about as we expected and we're seeing strength, I mentioned earlier about component inspection. Especially, semiconductor is also seeing strength. PCB is ahead of plan a little bit so I think that's moving along. Obviously, it's very tied to mobility and 5G. So, yes, we're seeing that pick up in terms of expectations for growth out of that product group.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: I would now like to turn the program back over to Kevin Kesseler -- Kessel, I apologize for any additional or closing remarks.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you very much. And wanted to thank everybody for their time, their interest, and their questions. We will be in touch. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today's KLA Corporation June quarter 2021 post earnings call. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-04-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: It’s Priscilla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation March Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick?
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining KLA’s earning calls today. KLA’s March quarter results demonstrate continued momentum in our business. We delivered strong 27% year-over-year revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross and operating profit rose 30% and 48% year-over-year, respectively and free cash flow grew 47% to a record level. We accomplished these by executing our strategic vision amidst the dynamic business environment. Year-to-date, we've seen a sharp increase in business levels across each of our major markets. This is primarily due to secular demand trends, driving semiconductor industry growth across a broad range of markets and applications such as 5G and cloud computing. Our customers are increasing their strategic CapEx investment to address these growth markets while continuing investment in leading-edge R&D efforts. Against this backdrop of strong demand, we continue to navigate evolving customer requirements and dynamic supply chain challenges. Still KLA has not missed a beat and continues operating at an exceptionally high level, delivering on our commitments, staying focused on creating value for our partners, customers, and shareholders. We would be remiss if we did not mention that achieving these results would be impossible without the extraordinary contributions of our talented global teams who always rise to the challenges of meeting our customer's needs in an increasingly complex global business environment. Three key things enabled KLA’s record results in momentum. One, successful innovation and market leadership, two, the resourcefulness and talent of our global workforce, and three, the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model. Before we discuss this further, let me begin by touching on how we see the industry demand environment now. Strong secular demand trends continue to shape multiple markets and are fueled by the increasing digitization of end markets and industries. In addition, there's a heightened focus on the strategic nature of our customers' investments around both leading-edge development, optimizing facility utilization and regionalization. As a result, our WFE forecast has improved even further from January, reflecting the strength of demand we're experiencing over the past couple of months, with momentum continuing into calendar 2022. In this environment, KLA is experiencing a sharp increase in customer demand for systems and support for 2021 deliveries. And our expectations for KLA revenue growth have increased from our initial assessment in January. This momentum in customer investment is happening against a backdrop where process control intensity maintains its momentum and KLA continues to drive market leadership at levels approximately 4x the nearest competitor. Propelled by the upside we are experiencing in the underlying WFE markets, KLA market leadership, increasing long-term process control intensity, our broader reach into electronics ecosystem and the contributions of our large and growing service business. KLA is on track to achieve our 2023 financial targets well ahead of our original expectations. KLA’s market leadership results from the ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiation with a unique portfolio of products, technologies, and strategies that address the most critical process control market challenges. We're pleased to continue to see the success of our efforts being validated by our customers’ purchasing decisions. Here are some recent success stories to illustrate the point. The most recently published Gartner data shows that in 2020, the total optical inspection market grew at a rate double that of the growth rate of the overall WFE market to approximately $1.9 billion with KLA maintaining our strong market leadership and 83% share of this critical market for process control. Many already know that KLA is participating in the automotive electronics through our semiconductor packaging and PCP product lines. We're excited by near-term plans to launch new versions of our process control products, tailored to the automotive industry. This quarter expect to hear more about how KLA has positioned our wafer inspection portfolio to help customers drive higher reliability, quality and yield in automotive applications in both 200-millimeter and 300-millimeter production, which will help address some of the reported automotive semiconductor shortages going forward. Calendar year 2021 is position to be the sixth consecutive year of revenue growth for KLA, demonstrating strong through-cycle growth, the success of our diversification strategies and our market leadership in process control and a large and growing contribution from our services business. Let's briefly cover the top five highlights from the March quarter results. First, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter, as expected memory demand also grew as memory customer's plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, but the demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across major end markets. The strength in demand we're seeing reflects KLA’s essential role in supporting our customers drive to innovate and continuing to invest in future technology notes. Second, Gartner's recent market share report for 2020 sized KLA’s share of process control over 53% for the year. KLA’s market share in process control has maintained a steady growth trajectory over the past 10 years. Highlights of the 2020 report show, KLA continuing to strengthen our core franchise and optical inspection and strong momentum and gains EBM inspection and optical metrology. Increasing investment in leading-edge foundry/logic, the accelerated adoption of EUV continues to be major factors, driving equipment spending. KLA’s market leadership once again demonstrates the success of our portfolio approach to solving complex customer requirements at the leading-edge. Third, our services revenue was $428 million in the March quarter or 24% of total sales, with over 75% of services revenue in our Semiconductor Process Control segment resulting from recurring contract agreements. Services is on track for another strong double-digit growth year, driven by our growing installed base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and the EPC group. Our semi process control service business revenue continues to grow faster than the rate of the installed base, growing approximately 2.8 times faster over the last five years. Fourth, this was another growth quarter for our electronics packaging and components or EPC group, highlighted by record quarterly bookings for the semiconductor – the specialty semiconductor business. Growth was driven by automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and advanced packaging applications across various end markets. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio across fast growing new markets in the electronics value chain, such as RF, automotive semiconductors, and advanced packaging. As it relates to EPC's opportunities in advanced packaging markets, KLA strengthened our engagement with the top five semiconductor market leaders in packaging. And we're expanding our reach with those sets. KLA is ramping our investment in advanced packaging market to drive adoption of new technologies in this exciting growth market, in addition to new inspection products for high level production and assembly. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the March quarter, we repurchased $273 million of our common stock and paid a $139 million in dividends, for a total capital return of $412 million or 71% of free cash flow of $585 million, which was also a record. Last July KLA’s Board of Directors authorized the 11 consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since its inception in 2006, KLA’s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. We believe KLA’s track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before Bren gets into greater details of our financial highlights, let me recap. KLA’s March, 2021 results demonstrate the critical nature of KLA’s products and services and enabling the digital transformation with our lives, the resiliency of the KLA operating model and our commitment to productive capital allocation. KLA is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet demanding and customer requirements, balancing sensitivity and throughput. Semiconductor and electronics landscape is constantly changing. We're seeing broadening customer interest driven by more technology innovation than ever before at the leading edge. We believe there are multiple secular factors driving industry demand and KLA will continue to benefit from and position us to exceed our 2023 financial targets reach them earlier than anticipated. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth, strong long-term operating leverage should provide robust cash flow generation and consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I'll pass the call over to Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. Results this quarter highlighted the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategies. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. Total revenue in the March quarter was $1.8 billion at the top of the guided range. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, above the midpoint of the guided range is stronger revenue in favorable product mix drove upside in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 at the upper end of the guided range, GAAP EPS was $3.66. Non-GAAP total operating expenses were $407 million, including $239 million of R&D expense and $168 million of SG&A. At KLA technical application support for our customers is included in SG&A and was $42 million in the quarter. The combination of R&D expense and technical applications represents about 70% of total operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue was very strong at 40.4%. Given higher revenue expectations for the remaining three quarters of 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities, regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, and increased investment in our infrastructure globally, particularly in expanding our manufacturing footprint and completing our new HQ2 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect operating expenses to be approximately $412 million to the June quarter. We were budgeting quarterly operating expenses to increase sequentially $3 million to $5 million a quarter or the near-term horizon. Given top line expectations for 2021 and fueled by double-digit growth over the past two years. We expect that the business will continue to outperform our target operating model, both in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Non-GAAP net income was $598 million, GAAP net income was $567 million. Cash flow from operations was $646 million and free cash flow was $585 million. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of over 32%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC group delivered results mostly in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, including its associated service business was $1.51 billion, the sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 28% compared with March of last year. The approximate semiconductor customer mix was as follows. Foundry/logic was strong as expected at 69%, and memory was 31%. In memory, the business was split roughly 55% NAND and 45% DRAM. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment in March was $92 million, up 1% sequentially and up 8% over the prior year. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, power and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $205 million, up 14% sequentially, and up 28% year-over-year with mobility markets driving strength in advanced PCB and finished component inspection. Revenue by major product category and region are both broken out in the shareholder letter in slides. From a balance sheet perspective, KLA ended the quarter with $2.4 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agents. In terms of cash flow and capital returns, Rick already covered the highlights. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. While circumstances can change, our current expectation is that our capital returns profile for calendar 2021 will exceed 85% of the expected free cash flow. As it relates to guidance, our overall semiconductor demand at WFE outlook is expanded further from our view in January, where we characterize the WFE market to grow in the low teens plus or minus a few points. We are revising up our view for the WFE market to grow on a percentage basis in the low-to-mid 20s with a bias to the upside at calendar 2021 from approximately $61 billion in 2020, reflecting the strengthening of demand we have experienced over the past couple of months across all segments. Also in earnings in January, we provided a high level outlook of business levels being roughly flat quarter-to-quarter for calendar year 2021. As we look ahead, based on the strength of our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, along with expected product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to continue to improve sequentially quarter-to-quarter throughout the remainder of the calendar year, with the second half growing versus the first half, as more KLA manufacturing capacity comes online to support this robust customer demand environment. This growth is fueled principally by our Semiconductor Process Control business. This business is positioned well in terms of expected performance in 2021, relative to the overall WFE market. Our June quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenues expected to be in a range of $1.855 billion plus or minus $100 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be about 68% and memory is expected to be approximately 32% of semi process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 60% of the segment mix. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63%, as product mix expectations normalize in the June quarter. Based on increased revenue volume and product mix expectations for 2021, we are now modeling gross margin to be between 62% and 62.5% for the calendar year. While in any given quarter, the mix of our business will affect our gross margin results, the structural trends, both in terms of product cost and product positioning remain compelling in our sustainable tailwinds going forward. Other model assumptions include non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $412 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $3.20 to $4.8. And non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.47 to $4.35. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 154.5 million shares. In closing the industry dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling with solid demand across end markets in a multiple technology nodes. We’re encouraged by the strength of the leading indicators of our business and our customers multi-year plans for continued investment. KLA is executing well and we have continued confidence that we're on track to both exceed our 2023 financial targets and achieve them sooner than anticipated on the strength of higher industry demand. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustain technology leadership, deep competitive moat, strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I’ll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, we're ready to queue for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll now take our first question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulate on a really strong results. Rick or Bren, the first question I had was you're guiding to WFE obviously update since three months ago, similarly the mid-20 range. I'm kind of curious, if I look at some of your peers, they're talking about 30% range, but either way from your vantage point, how do you think KLA has any process controlled revenues are going to do relative to your mid-20’s WFE growth on a calendar of 2021 basis, and then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Krish. Thanks for the comments. Hey, I'll start here, but you have to remember that everybody uses a different baseline. So that's why I put the baseline in there. So I said that against the baseline of 2020 of $61 billion, we saw a – we see growth from there in the low-to-mid 20s percentile as – with bias to the upside. So I think that as we see it, you do the math on that, that puts you in that sort of $75 billion plus range of WFE, and certainly the momentum that we saw over the course of the quarter has increased pretty substantially, really across all segments. So we feel pretty good, not only about the growth of the overall industry, but the positioning of the semi process control segment against that industry growth expectation. So I think that it sets up well for us, we have to execute over the remainder of the year, but I think it sets up well for us in terms of relative performance against the industry.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Super helpful, Bren. And then as a follow-up, and thanks for the color on the market share data from last year. I'm just looking more – looking ahead, can you talk a little bit for the market share dynamics, obviously a large U.S. company has spoken about gaining traction in process control, introduced a new optical inspection tool with the EB combo along with AI. So I'm kind of curious, are you seeing that impact, especially in foundry and logic? Or how do you kind of counteract that especially given that you are obviously the leader in this space today?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think that there is no question that the demand for process control continues to be strong as Bren said, and we view process control in 2021 is outgrowing the overall market based on those drivers. From a competitive standpoint, we also expect to be able to continue the plan we laid out in 2020 – 2019, which is to increase our overall position of process control as we have in the last couple of years and we think that continues based on the strength of our product portfolio and the engagement we have with our existing customers. There is no question that there is always going to be competition out there, but if you look at the history of the gardener data, as we highlighted over time, KLA has consistently been successful in leveraging our strategies to build on our market position and gain share. And we don't see anything about the current competitive environment that will change that. We do have some major products to deliver in terms of in areas like reticle inspection, but – and that's happening this year. But we're very pleased with the performance of our optical inspection and we’re also very encouraged by the recent success of our e-beam offerings that we really got back in those segments in the last year or so, so we feel good about our competitive position. And as you might imagine, it kind of shows up in our gross margin in terms of the strength of our business and our competitive position that we're able to continue to have the kind of margin profile that we have, despite the fact that we've added EPC, which overall at a corporate level you know was dilutive to the margins that KLA had prior to that. So I think that should be evidence of our strength.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Really helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And we will move next to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just first on the gross margin in the March quarter, what drove the upside and I guess importantly, as you look at June and full calendar year guide, what are the assumptions that you're making for kind of mix? And to what extent are you above target because of cyclical, because of mix, or should we just start thinking about 62 plus is being kind of a new target?
Bren Higgins: Yes, John, thanks for the question. So when you look back at the March quarter, most of the growth sequentially in the quarter came from the semi process control business. And as Rick just mentioned and that's a richer business for us overall. So that combined with the upside in the quarter in terms of incremental revenue is what drove the margins up to where they were. It's a little bit lower as we look at the June quarter. It’s still in line with the kind of guidance that we've been providing at 62% plus or minus. So we're mostly in line with that as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do have some sequential growth in EPC, and so that's diluted from that standpoint. But in general, I think that the margin drivers structurally are all pretty solid. We're seeing nice leverage overall in the business from the activities – the strength of the business and the activities in our factory. So we're seeing good efficiencies there. And then over the course of the year, I think just given the directionally where it's moving, as I mentioned last quarter, I thought it was 61.5% to 62% for the year, certainly the stronger outlook in terms of top line, but also just the drivers underneath in terms of what we're expecting from certain products. I think we're in line with that sort of 62% to 62.5% that I talked about on prepared remarks. And given the strength in the business overall probably more biased to the upper end of that range. So I think that there is sustainable traction in these areas, particularly around certain products. We talked about the inflection and growth and optical inspection. So anytime you see products like that inflecting, that's going to drive to a richer mix overall for the overall business.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Rick as my follow-up going back to kind of the market share question, which I think is one of the key investor concerns out there. I think the concern that some investors have is that as we hit this inflection from optical to more exotic like – sources like e-beam an x-ray, there is sort of a view that the incumbency advantage kind of goes away. And perhaps we're all kind of estimating that inflection to happen more quickly than it will. But can you help me better understand the 4x market share advantage that you have in the optical world? How does that position you as we start moving to these new technologies?
Rick Wallace: Yes, thanks, John. I think the – I'm not certain of this, but I think the fastest growing product in metrology and inspection, pretty certain was our GEN5 over the last couple of years. And the strength of that is driven by its ability to satisfy the needs that we have for inspection measurement with EUV, specifically around print down and also the advanced nodes. There is nothing that we're seeing that indicates the percent of inspection and metrology budget is dramatically increasing toward e-beam. In fact, if anything, it's always been the challenge to drive the optical at a higher rate because the price performance is so much higher. I'd also say that the people that are closest to having a multi beam – e-beam solution are KLA, we're the ones that have it, that we're developing and introducing in the radical space which is I think – where it's needed the most. So we don't really see any inflection, we don't see a change, the market share dynamic. And if anything, the challenge that Bren and the operations team have is satisfying the increased demand around the optical portfolio that we have specifically GEN5, but also GEN4, which has it slowed down. So I don't buy the thesis that this is the transition, it hasn't been for years, and the reason is because optical keeps getting better and it's really difficult to make at e-beam tool that's fast enough to satisfy most of the inspection requirements. In terms of pointing e-beam – pointing optical with e-beam, that's not a new idea, that's been around quite a while, and at KLA, we introduced that concept when we introduced our e-beam inspection tool and talked about it at our Analyst Day, that just allows those tools to be functional and to continue to provide value. So I don't think that transition is happening.
Bren Higgins: John, I’d just add – I'm sorry, just one other thing – I think just in terms of overall growth rates, right, so we talked about the accelerated growth relative to the market in 2020 and I would expect this business to grow faster than market again in 2021. So I think the good thing about the complementary nature of our e-beam solutions with our optical is driving higher relevancy in use case application across the optical inspection, which is the large market, right, that's the market, that's $2 billion plus in terms of opportunities. So to give you some perspective on the strategy overall, but there is an inflection here, that's validating, I think the relevancy of optical inspection in a lot of different ways.
John Pitzer: And Rick, does the incumbency advantage you enjoy at optical transferable as the world starts to move to e-beam?
Rick Wallace: Yes. John, I – again, I don't think the world is going to move large scale to e-beam. I mean, we're well-positioned if it does, but I just don't think that the – I think there is going to be a mix and match and the percent of layers that could be inspected by e-beam is never going to be as high as what could be expected by optical, especially since GEN5 is still on the early iterations. We have more capability to add to GEN5, it's – we've been adding – have for awhile added AI capability to that. So I think in general, yes, we have a good e-beam solution, but our modeling doesn't show that that's going to be the increased percentage of the use case, because optical can satisfy, especially GEN5 and satisfy the needs that are going to be through the 2020s, even past when we get the high end – EUV, and remember, that's only a percentage of the layers that are going to be subject to that. So I don't think we're going to see this transition to e-beam. I think incumbency for KLA has really been based on our ability to keep delivering new capability to the market. Not so much because we've been there, but our newest products, which is why we invest so heavily in R&D and the application support for our customers. So I don't think it's going to transition, we'd be fine if it did, but I think it's a better price performance for our customers to have as many layers be done optically as possible, because the throughput capabilities just so much better in optical than it is in any form of e-beam.
John Pitzer: Great color. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, Rick, I wanted to go back to your earlier comment around process control outgrowing WFE, and to me logically, when we're adding meaningful capacity, I would think process tools would outperform and process control would underperform, not any hit to you, but just where you fit in terms of the order of spending. And here you've outlined mid-20s kind of growth for the industry, whereas we've heard 37% growth from ASML, we've got 30 plus percent growth from Lam. How in that world does process control outperform? Is it Intel coming back? Is it at mask inspection spend from China, what are the moving parts that can allow that to happen?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I'll give some color and then Bren can fill in some of the details. But if you – if we assume the market is, let's say, just pick a number 22% WFE growth this year, what we're loaded right now and what we're modeling that we need to do, just based on the orders and the conversations we're having with customers daily is – will significantly outgrow that. I don't know if it'll be 38%, but it'll probably start with a 3, in terms of what it is. Now, we don't know what WFE is going to actually be this year, but if that's what process control, that's just based on the conversations we're having right now. Ahmad Khan, who runs that businesses and calls almost three times a week talking about slots and support for customers across his portfolio, I get pulled into them occasionally, but that's the conversation, it’s how can we support that. And when we model it, we look at that business and we think it's going to be a very strong grower this year. Could the WFE numbers change? Yes, of course. What's it driven on to your other question CJ, it's – of course it's driven by the increased investment people have in the advanced design rules, it's not a secret that TSM has talked about dramatically increasing their CapEx this year. And we know what Intel has said publicly, but it's not just that we're seeing increased commitment and conversation from the memory manufacturers who want that capability too. So I think the difference between the process control intensity and foundry logic is still there, but it is narrowing a bit as people push harder on the advanced nodes for – specifically for the advanced DRAM work that's going, but also some NAND work too. Bren, maybe you can fill in.
Bren Higgins: Yes CJ, I always struggle a little bit with these questions just because everybody uses different baselines. I don't know what the baselines were for the different companies and sometimes they don't even share them, so you don't really know when you're thinking about percentages. So I try to show our work here and let you know how we're thinking about it. If you look at 2020, that KLA’s performance was pretty much in line with the market, if you went from $50 million to $53 billion in 2019 to 2020 at $61 billion, that's about 16% overall. And if you look at semi-PC equipment, it was in that ballpark. So as we look at this year, as I said earlier, if you're looking at $75 billion plus I think that's where the industry is against the $61 million baseline, then you're like in the mid-20s to our prepared remarks and against that backdrop, I would expect process control to do very well. And so we'll see how it goes, I'm not going to guide the second half, certainly we would expect the second half to be stronger in that business overall. And I think the drivers are pretty compelling and pretty broad based. So we'll see how it goes as we move forward here, but that's – I think that's how I see it at this point.
CJ Muse: Yes. Very helpful. As my follow-up, you alluded to supply constraints or adding on additional capacity. We'd love to hear – you guys typically run your business to roughly seven months backlog, has that extended? And I guess, how should we be thinking about the timing of bringing on capacity implications to the model, either gross margins of OpEx, if at all? And if your lead times are extending beyond that kind of seven month timeframe, do you have visibility now into the first half of 2022? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Well, we prefer to operate right around six months where we can, now our products do vary, some have very long lead times, where you're looking at some of our high end systems, the timing to procure and optical components, and then polish and grind optics can take some time. So for some of those products, the lead times are significantly longer. I'd say today, if you aggregate it across the company, we're a little bit longer than we'd like to be. So we'd like to target somewhere in that five to six, and we're probably somewhere in that seven to eight range as we look at it today. And capacity is coming online, really across the board. We're adding people into all of our factories worldwide. We've been doing that since we started to see the business inflect in November in a meaningful way. We're adding capacity in terms of space at all of our major factories around the world. And we're working very closely with our suppliers, suppliers have been great in supporting our ramp so far. They're adding and investing and we're investing in them in a lot of cases. So I would expect that given the guidance, the growth we're expecting in the second half will happen as a result of incremental capacity and we can continue to work that. So I think given the expectations around six months of – in terms of our lead time, we can continue to add to what we have to support whatever environment we’re facing. At the end of the day, KLA doesn't lose business because we can't deliver. So we also will move things around as needed to be able to support our customers. And we do a lot from a tactical point of view to try to shorten cycle times, adding shifts, all the little things you can do to pull in and cut days out of out of a lead time. So all those activities are ongoing, and I think that as we execute against that into the second half, I think it creates opportunities for us to deliver to the expectations we have right now, but also to support upside if it presents itself.
CJ Muse: Thanks, Bren.
Bren Higgins: And I don't see any reason why it seems to be sustaining even as we move beyond right in terms of – I don't see anything falling off anytime soon.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, CJ.
Operator: We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Okay, good afternoon.
Harlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In foundry I know most of the discussion has been focused on leading edge, but there is significant wafer tightness on lag in the c-mass technologies 16, 28, 40 nanometer and higher. I know your sweet spot is advanced technologies, but there is some part of the demand strength in process control coming from these bagging-edge processes as capacity gets built out. So what percentage of your business and process control is exposed to mature technology nodes?
Bren Higgins: So the full China, all the business in China I’d classify as mature. And most of that is pretty boundary weighted this year. There is some wafer investment that's happening, there is some memory investment, but I'd still say it's probably greater than 60%, 65% boundary, I don't have it in front of me. And so you've got that, plus you've got other activity. I would say probably somewhere in the semi process control equipment, if I just look at the equipment part of the business, it's probably somewhere around 25% of our revenue, I would call 28 nanometer and above, 25% to 30%.
Harlan Sur: Perfect.
Rick Wallace: Just to add to it. It's not just tight there as you know, it's tight everywhere. And so you do remember years ago, if you think back to when there was one product and that would transition to the next product and people would reuse capabilities, that's really not an option now. And so what you get is that heavily utilization that benefits that sales, but also we see that in service. So that's what's part of what's driving the higher levels of our growth in service.
Harlan Sur: Great, good insights there. And then as a follow-on, I mean, on the EPC business with – again with the chip tightness on mature technologies, especially automotive and industrial focused and tightness in advanced packaging and substrates. I would assume that this would be driving strong demand for EPCs portfolio of products, because they are focused on specialty processes, advanced packaging and PCB. And I think last call, I think your view was that x-display that EPC would go 15% this year, but just given the strong demand for analog RF, power transistors, advanced substrates, PCB capacity. Do you guys have a new view of EPC growth for this year?
Rick Wallace: We do. I think you hit it, and again, if you take out the display piece, which has its own dynamics as you know, I'd say that we were being powered by – and we talked about this in past Harlan, but by 5G largely if you think about it, most of 2020 and early. Now the thing that we have counted on early in terms of the deal thesis was automotive. And as you know and everybody knows, they hit the brakes hard last year when the view of the overall economy was tough. Largely, I'd say that in some other factors that would have contributed to this chip shortage. And so now they're back on and you're right, that's definitely driving EPC as PTS is being driven by that dynamic as well. So now it's really firing on all cylinders. And so we're seeing really strong growth across EPC in terms of supporting both the continued momentum in 5G, but also now automotive. And I mentioned in my comments that we're going to talk more about some of the new offerings we're having to support our automotive customers, which we hope will not just help in terms of solving some of their problems, but alleviate some of these shortages as we help them with yields, which is really the near-term, the best leverage they have in terms of providing more output is higher yield.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. One of the things I'm encouraged by with everything that Rick said is including display now, I would say that the expectations about – for EPC are in the mid-teens. So with that reflects some of the growth drivers in growth that we're seeing in the businesses that Rick mentioned. We'll see how it plays out half to half, I think it will be reasonably balanced. We are doing a ERP integration on one of those businesses. And so that could drive some revenue across quarters a little bit as you prepare for that. But pretty consistent level of business, and as I said overall for the entire group growth expectations that are kind of meet 15 for the year. So we feel pretty good about where we're at with those businesses and particularly on that growth, I think with all the synergy work we've been doing across the company in those – in that group really pleased with the operating leverage as well.
Harlan Sur: Great insights. Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. You mentioned China and that the activity is mostly foundry. Can you give us an update on how big you see the China sovereign business, how much growth you see coming this year? And how fragmented is it, how many different customers are you seeing that are kind of spread out across that WFE?
Rick Wallace: It would probably grow mostly in line with the overall market I would think and very fragmented lots of customers.
Joe Moore: Okay, great.
Rick Wallace: And also included in that Joe – Joe, also included in that is also some of the wafer activity that's happening, where you're in mask, where there some investment in infrastructure to support the broader ecosystem.
Joe Moore: Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then as it comes – pertains to regulation, whether it's the CHIPS Act or the export controls reform, that's kind of going through. I guess, do you feel like the equipment industry in KLA specifically has kind of a voice in the government in terms of the direction of these things and – or is it kind of more dictated by the semiconductor customers? Just how big is the lobbying kind of government affairs efforts from the equipment companies these days?
Rick Wallace: Joe, I think what's really happened is there has been an openness in general to understand the dynamics. I think that a fear that many of us had was that there might've been unilateral action if you go back a year or so. And it doesn't feel like there's going to be that now it's going to be multilateral. It's going to be thoughtful. And we're all in favor of free trade and nobody wants IP or other factors to be compromised. So I do feel like there's a constructive dialogue around that, and it's not just the semiconductor guys. It's also the equipment companies and we feel really good about where that conversation is.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: And we'll move now to Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. On EUV, I’m just curious you talked a lot about process control intensity, clearly benefiting from EUV. But I guess at 3-nanometer, we're starting to see a big step up in the number of EUV layers. Is that something we should think about as maybe an incremental driver is for you guys?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Joe, for sure. I mean, we're having, as you know, the development work, there's a lot of process control work that goes on early on when we're doing R&D and development for our customers. And there's definitely an increased sensitivity to the number of layers that they have to qualify. And that drives multiple markets, but obviously ensuring the quality of the radicals and when they're printed that the high quality is there. Now it's across more layers. So that drives adoption of Gen 5, also just more sensitivity to smaller defects. So in general, that shifts the dynamic. If you thought about a blend between Gen 4 and Gen 5, Gen 4 is still very active. As a product line, this will shift it more in those advanced nodes to a higher percentage of those tools being Gen 5 tools and the next-generation or iterations on Gen 5 as we move forward. I think we mentioned I the past, Gen 5 is very early in its product life cycle. And there are a number of additional capabilities that will be added to it to support advanced. So those are just two areas. There'll be others in terms of the metrology challenges, but in general, the process control challenges as we move forward especially on advanced design rules will increase. And we're seeing that play out right now in development. So Joe, one other factor to keep in mind that now you have these technical drivers in these no transitions that forced customers to have to think about incremental capability and those requirements. And so the ability to reuse a lot of the capacity they might've purchased in a prior node is harder because you've got stronger end market adoption that's clearly happening. Today, particularly at the 5-nanometre node, but then also the technical drivers of that, even if they could use the tool, it doesn't meet the technical requirements. So that's another factor that drives intensity, that's pretty important to our overall business.
Joe Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then maybe one for Bren, on the capacity increasing for your manufacturing footprint, I mean, how do we think about your planning in terms of, supporting overall WFE? Because I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about sustained growth looking even into next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes. Look, I don't think we're capacity constrained within the windows that we talk about. Just in general that we think that we – there is no upper limit, right. We'll continue to work and we continue to invest. Certainly, there's some time to some of the lead time on our parts, but whether it's facilities, we like to think about people, parts and space at KLA, typically our long-term goal is around parts around some of the components we talked about. So we're going to continue to add capacity and send a strong signals into a supply chain to drive the investments that are required and will based on customer readiness and customer expectations. We'll do what we need to continue to support those activities as we go forward, even beyond 2021. So I'm not worried about our ability though. I'm worried with that we're challenged and it's not easy, and there's a lot of work going on here. But at the same time, we know how to do this and we'll continue to make the investments that are required to get the capacity to support the environment we're in.
Rick Wallace: Thanks Joe.
Joe Quatrochi: Perfect, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll move next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and congrats. Rick, not to make you sound old, but you've been in this industry for awhile given that you've seen previous cycles and how they've acted in terms of these kinds of first volumes, where you've had to accelerate capacity. Bren, just mentioned that he's not particularly worried about meeting customer demand, but as we get into the secular change in terms of the industry where we may have sustained an elevated spending, how do you look at, I guess meeting the challenges of supply as well as meeting customer demand, particularly for both, for new tools for their needs, how do you manage potentially an extended period of spending at very elevated levels?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Patrick. Thanks for not making me feel old. I think every cycle as I'm sure you've heard is different. One of the things that we learned early on though, is to look at follow the money and figure out how profitable your customers are and what is sustainable. And I go back to periods where I remember companies that were spending 2x their CapEx was twice the size of their revenue. And you just knew that couldn't last, right. So when we look at the supply chain, now one of the leading indicators we always look at is profitability of our customers and it's universally good. I mean, there are some examples where customers are investing in, and we see this in China where they don't have a revenue base to support the investment. But those are viewed as strategic investments, but the percent of that that's in the industry right now is really low. And so it's the growth of the semiconductor industry broadly with all the different drivers, the number of players that have maintained their profitability through these cycles and the fact that that gives us confidence in the sustainability. I don't think we're going to see growth rate that's 25%, 30%. We're talking about what it might be this year. That's not going to be the long-term growth rate. I think there's a step up to get to support these new drivers. And I would imagine it presumes it's growth at a more reasonable, upper single-digit kind of level for the equipment industry as we kind of modeled. But the step up is consistent with the multiple drivers. As Bren mentioned, we have a lot of leverage in terms of being able to utilize our facilities, but even that, given that we're investing right now to make sure we've got additional people, parts and space as Bren said, so that we could support the ramps that we're seeing. I do think this is a step up. I think we've seen it in the past. And I think that the business is sustainable. I don't think 30% growth will happen for several years in a row. But if it did, we'd be there to support it. So we feel really good about where we are. And more importantly, the investments we're making in our capability are enabling our customers to achieve their objectives. And that's really the key to our continued success is to make sure we're staying relevant with our customers. Does that answer your question, Patrick?
Patrick Ho: No, that's very helpful. And to make you feel younger, Rick, I'll ask you the follow-up as well. As we look forward and we know process control does get, I guess, a good look at a lot of next-generation process technologies and manufacturing. You mentioned about EUV increasing layers and the adoption of Gen 5. As you look forward to foundry/logic, you have EUV increasing layers, but you also have in a few nodes, the transition to gate all around to nanowires, nanoribbons. Qualitatively from a process control standpoint, I know it's very early, which do you see out of the EUV increasing layers and the transition to the new transition of structures, which do you see as a larger incremental opportunity for KLA?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I think it's a great question. Just as you know, we do have a group inside of KLA that models out the advanced technology designs. We have some really talented people that we think about that years in advance, to think about what are the solutions that will be necessary. Gate all around is an interesting one, because there it's actually an adaptation to Gen 4, that's going to be most relevant to solving some of those problems based on the contrast of those devices. So we think that'll be incremental. As I mentioned in the earlier question, you think about more EUV layers that just drives the overall expectation of higher sensitivity across the portfolio, the increase for more inspection overall, and at a higher level of sensitivity. I tip it toward the advanced nodes driving more intensity than the new structures, but the new structures can't be discounted because if you can't make them successful, then you're not going to be able to ramp those nodes. So, but I'd say probably 60/40, maybe even 65/35, that it'll be the advanced design rules that drive it more. And it's not just going to be in foundry/logic because we're also seeing, even though it seems like they're almost out of gas, DRAM keeps pushing as well to drive the next capability improvement so that they can have competitive advantage. And I don't think that will base anytime soon.
Patrick Ho: Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: We'll move next to Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks a lot. I guess, I had the first question was on the whole e-beam versus optical thing. Applied to launch the enlightened tool in March and idea that you combine optical and e-beam and you do synchronizing to sort of determine what defects matter. You guys talked about that a lot back in the back half of 2019 with the eSL10. So I guess, conceptually, it's not new, but they had a pretty strong e-beam review presence. So I guess in theory, that could provide kind of a better input for the AI algorithm. But can you sort of talk about just this general idea and maybe sort of whether it can change the impact the e-beam could have on the market and your position?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Tim. Thank you for remembering what we said in 2019. I could go back even further when we introduced some spec back years and years ago, and the idea it was a pointer for optical back then. And that was in the 90s. So this idea of e-beam directing optical is an old idea. The idea that – the problem that it has in general, and this is an interesting question is, do you have systemic defects? Do you really – can you actually point that, AI has helped solve some of those problems, but there's still this basic question about coverage. And can you cover enough of the wafers to see enough of the AI? If you look at a modern wafer in a leading fab, they don't have many defects. I mean, there are very few, so you need to cover a lot of area. And that's what optical is really good at. The e-beam ends up being the most valuable in debugging of a new process at the very front end, which is why it's mostly been in R&D. And that's what we're continuing to see. AI has been added to the products we've been doing that for a number of years, whatever your definition is, increasing the intelligence, the algorithm that's been KLA sweet-spot for years, and we continue to do that. So I don't think that the announcement of two and a half year old technology earlier this year was really anything revolutionary, other than –it's not new. And I don't think that the relevancy of what we're doing changes as a result. I do think that increasing the capability, the ML and the AI across all the products in this industry will continue to make them more relevant as we go forward for KLA and others as well. So I think that's an area we're all taking advantage of, and that'll help increase the capability and the learning that the industry has in general, we'll be able to move forward. But I don't think this was not a dislocation. It was not anything new for customers. It might've been new for other communities, but the disclosures and the conversations are not new to customers.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks, Rick. And then, I guess just last thing for me, so service, obviously, it's a lower portion of your total, rather than your peers. I know that you're never going to be like the films guys given the nature of their technologies, some of their tools eat themselves. So, obviously it's sort of like apples and oranges there, but some of them also were sort of guaranteeing performance and metrics like that. And they're sort of selling that. And I'm wondering what sort of new things you're bringing to bear in service to maybe help your service business start to grow a little faster? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Yes, Tim. I mean, I think one of the things in service for us is that we have the ability to really customize our offerings for customers, both in terms of response times, in terms of stocking levels, in terms of uptime commitments and things like that. And then given that, and given the nature of the contract that we structure, and it's pretty important for – when customers buy process control, they buy what they need. And then they have contracts to ensure that the tools are running full out all the time. And they are willing to invest in a contract structure and ensure that we can keep them up and make sure that they match and all those sorts of things. So it's a little bit different business, customers because they don't have as many, they have tens instead of hundreds as they would in a process tool. They don't necessarily have the ability to build the capability internally to be able to do self service. And so that's a unique aspect of our service business. There's also the complexity of what we offer relative to the process tools, which is far different. So for all those reasons, it does drive a different service experience with customers. And as I said, we customize to meet their operating expense requirements and what they're looking to get out of their fab. And it does drive this 75% plus contract revenue stream. I think there's always what happens with the new tools in terms of our ability to sell and support service on new tools. I think where we've seen a lot more engagement with customers is the – in the trailing edge where you're seeing higher reliability and quality requirements. Particularly, let's say, for example, in areas like automotive, where customers weren't as focused on the process control outcomes as much as they are today, with the growth that we're seeing and the increase in reliability that's required. And given the margin structure in that industry, for example, it's pretty important that you don't under kill, right, because of the cost of recall and so on, but then there's also overkill too. So there's a lot more process control engagement. That's happening through our service business with those customers to support the install base at a greater level. So you don't see tools falling off, you see them staying in service. And that's what, it's probably the unique growth driver that we're seeing today as products are living longer. And some of these other markets are inflecting.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: And we have time for one more question. We'll take our final question today from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. You will be at your 2023 target model this year, basically two years ahead, but that seems to have been driven a lot more by market growth, rather than I think in your target model, you had penciled in one to two points of share gains. And I know Rick, you highlighted a third-party survey that had your share kind of slipping a little bit last year. I'm just curious, when do you think we should start expecting share gains for you over the next few years. And will that be driven by the launch of new products or will that be driven by share in a like-to-like category, will that be driven by spending being more foundry/logic based. Just how do we think about what you had talked about share gains at the analyst day versus what you have seen so far and how we should think about this share shift over the next one to two years?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Vivek, I'll take the first part and let Bren talk about model. We actually are ahead of our share projections that we laid out in the analyst day. In 2019, we gained 3.3 – 3% share and that got a 0.7 down. This is what the survey says, but we had modeled 2.5% over the four years and we've gained 2.3% over two years. And we believe that this year will be another strong year. So I mean, these things move – annually it’s kind of hard because there are puts and takes, but competitively we're actually ahead of plan and largely that's driven by the success mainly of Gen 5 and what we're seeing in the optical inspection portfolio, that's been the bigger gains. We have new products coming out that will add to that. But our expectation of share growth is actually higher than it was at the time when we did the analyst meeting based on the success that we've had today. And then Bren can talk more about the model.
Bren Higgins: From a top line point of view, you're right. It's been – what's driven, it mostly has been, yes. We had some incremental share improvement relative to the plan we were on, but just stronger industry growth. We talked a lot in part of our theme was if you will, back for our Investor Day was to talk a lot about opportunities related to EUV and increasing memory opportunities to drive incremental adoption of process control and KLA solutions. We talked about radical inspection requirements for EUV that would affect the radical inspection tools, but also the wafer inspection tools. We also talked about new markets like e-beam that we were reentering and then finally opportunities in memory metrology. So those, in some ways we're going to create incremental revenues, almost irrespective of the WFE level. If we look at where we are today, most of it's been industry growth in the, I'll call the normal products and the regular products and share opportunities driven our performance relative to the overall plant. The contributions from those products are still to come. We talked a lot about 2021 being opportunities to engage with customers to seed the markets and that we would start to see more steady state contributions in 2023 from those products. So we're still in that same phase regarding those. And in some cases, COVID has made it a little bit harder to engage with customers out in the field to support new products and to drive new markets. But I think that's still to come. So we've got a higher industry environment that's driven us to where we are today, but those contributions are still coming over the next couple of years. And so we're excited about that. And then on the leverage part, anytime you have revenue, that's growing what we saw in calendar 2020, where we were up 15% as a company and the growth expectations we now have for 2021, given the industry commentary earlier. Anytime you drive revenue like that, you're going to drive more leverage through the model. So yes, we're outperforming our public model by about four points in operating margin today. Do I think that that's sustainable at four points? Probably not, but do I think there's a couple points for sure sustainability there, I do, just given the strength of the products and the expected mix going forward. So yes, we're I think in a pretty good place relative to the overall model, we have to execute of course over the next year or so. And we'll have more to say about the future in the coming months and quarters.
Vivek Arya: If I can squeeze in a quick one, automotive, from your perspective, when do you think the automotive industry is able to address all these supply shortages that it's seeing from the semiconductor industry?
Rick Wallace: I think we're not the right people to answer that question. We're going to do everything we can to help them, but it's hard to understand exactly how they got so out of line with the demand. But I know that, there've been contributing factors and you've heard of some of them. Projects that weren't started fires that happened and the reluctance to invest earlier than them and retrospect was needed plus a strong demand. So we're going to do everything we can to help them, but they're the best people to ask for that.
Bren Higgins: Thanks Vivek.
Operator: Sorry, I’m just going to conclude the Q&A and turn the call back to you, Kevin.
Kevin Kessel: Yes. Sorry about that. Again, we appreciate everybody's time. We know it's been a bit very busy week for earnings, very busy day for earnings. Won't be busy this summer here with a lot of investor events, we look forward to seeing you again then. Take care.
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation March Quarter…

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-02-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. My name is Priscilla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants’ lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you. And welcome to KLA’s Fiscal Q2 2021 Quarterly Earnings Call to discuss the results of the December Quarter and our Outlook for the March Quarter. With me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today’s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending December 31, 2020, that we released today after the market closed in the form of a press release, shareholder letter and slide deck. All are available on the KLA IR section of our website. Today’s discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today’s earnings materials posted on our website. Today’s call also represents the end of the calendar year. We will make references to both 2020 and 2021. Please note all references are for the calendar year. Our IR website also contains future virtual investor conferences, as well as presentations, corporate governance information, and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. As many of you now know, we changed the format of our earnings two quarters ago to include pre-publishing a detailed shareholder letter that provides updates on our business performance. The pre-publishing allows this call to be efficient by providing more streamlined comments while also freeing up more time for your questions and answers. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. And thank you for joining us today and for your interest in KLA. As we reflect on the accomplishments of 2020, it’s important for me to first appreciate and acknowledge the global KLA team. Your perseverance, drive to be better and determination enabled KLA to rise to the challenge and deliver for our customers. 2020 was like no other year we have seen and while our teams have not been physically together for the most part; our company continues to demonstrate the great KLA culture of collaboration and innovation and is emerging stronger than ever. In the process, we delivered exceptionally strong financial results in the December quarter closing a strong year for the company. In our shareholder letter published today, we articulate how KLA’s record results are driven by success on multiple fronts, including the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As most of you have already seen from our results, 2020 was an impressive year for KLA on multiple fronts. We delivered strong growth, profitability and free cash flow, while continuously adjusting to the changing work environments driven by COVID. Through it all, we remained focused on meeting customer demand and delivering strong returns to shareholders in the rapidly growing semiconductor market. Bren will have much more to highlight on the financials for both the quarter and the year, but I’d like to hit on a few of the annual milestones. For the year, KLA revenue grew 15% to $6.1 billion, marking the fifth consecutive year of growth. We also delivered notable profitability growth with non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 28% and 32%, respectively year-over-year. Our free cash flow grew 44% to $1.8 billion and we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the December quarter, we saw a diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor Process Control revenue was once again above plan. The Electronics, Packaging, and Components group met its target and our Services business continued and delivered another quarter of growth and strong operating leverage. We ended the year with strong backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 as we continue to execute at a high level. We are operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and given the accelerated growth of our served markets, we remain solidly on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. All this reflects the dedication of our global teams and the enabling role KLA plays in our customers’ technology roadmaps and enhancing their return on capital investment. Moving to today’s demand environment, which continues to demonstrate accelerated adoption of several Semiconductor and Electronics industry growth drivers that we have been highlighting for the past few years, technology continues to transform how we live and work and the data-driven economy is fundamentally changing how businesses operate and deliver value. This digital transformation is enabling secular demand drivers such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and rapid growth in new automotive electronics, and 5G communications markets. Each of these secular trends are driving investment and innovation in advanced memory and logic semiconductor devices, as well as new and increasingly more complex advanced packaging and PCB technologies. With our market leadership in process control and growth and expansion to new markets like specialty semiconductor process equipment, PCB, and finished die inspection in our EPC Group, KLA is essential to enabling our increasingly digital world. As much as things have changed over the past year, one thing that’s remained a constant is our KLA operating model. KLA operating model is the enduring framework that we rely on to guide the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. We deploy the KLA operating model to align the company on a consistent strategy, tie accountability to results, drive product development execution, respond to changing market conditions and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring the company operates with strong fiscal discipline as we pursue our long-term performance and profitability objectives. Let’s turn now to five top highlights for our -- in our results for the quarter and for 2020. First, we saw a continued strength and breadth in foundry/logic demand in the quarter. As expected, memory demand also grew, as memory customers plan for growth and equipment investment in 2021 to meet improving end demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader set of customers in the March quarter, with demand momentum continuing throughout 2021 across our major end markets. The strength in demand we are seeing reflects KLA’s essential role in supporting our customers’ drive to innovate and continue to invest in future technology nodes. Second, we are seeing strong momentum in the marketplace from new products, driving market growth and share opportunities in both the Semiconductor Process Control and EPC Groups. Fueled by expanded customer investment and EUV lithography, the Semiconductor Process Control business is driving adoption with new applications in optical inspection portfolio such as EUV print check for GEN5 and expanding our share in new markets for KLA, including the eSL10 e-beam inspection platform and the nascent use of X-ray technologies for metrology applications. Third, our Services revenue grew to $1.56 billion or 25% of total sales in 2020. This is driven by growth in our install base, higher utilization rate and increasing expansion of service opportunities in the trailing edge and in the EPC Group. The strong results delivered in 2020 show how the Services team continues to do a fantastic job leveraging the KLA operating model to deliver at a high level. Working in close collaboration with customers and partners, the Services business innovated and drove new initiatives against the unprecedented challenges of COVID. Not only did our Services business receive praise from our customers but also grew share of wallet and we have seen our contact penetration steadily increase in 2020 from 70% to 75% plus, which fuels recurring revenue streams and generates strong operating leverage and cash flows. Fourth, this was a very encouraging year for the newly established EPC Group, demonstrating success and KLA’s growth strategies and highlighting how execution of the KLA operating model drives market leadership and improved operating leverage in acquired businesses. Revenue growth was strong and we believe that on a net basis will exceed our $50 million annual acquisition cost synergy target by at least another additional $30 million. With EPC, KLA is now providing a more comprehensive and broader product portfolio, and addressing fast growing new markets in the Electronics value chain such as RF, automotive, 5G wireless connectivity and display. Relative to the adoption of 5G, KLA has exposure to many key components in the Electronics value chain as well. The EPC Group ended the year with record backlog setting the stage for double-digit growth in 2021 and for incremental operating margins on that growth in line with the total company model. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, in the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. Back in July, KLA’s Board of Directors authorized the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase to a yearly run rate of $3.60 per share. Since inception in 2006, KLA’s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15%. In 2020, KLA returned to $1.23 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow. Before Bren gets into the greater detail of our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges that persisted throughout the year associated with COVID, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of its global workforce, we have adapted well and we end 2020 in a position of strength, while delivering record results and set the stage for the sixth consecutive year of growth. KLA is exceptionally well-positioned at the forefront of technology innovation with a comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the demanding customer requirements, which balance sensitivity and throughput. The Semiconductor and Electronics landscape is constantly changing, and we are seeing broadening customer interest, which was being applied to more technology innovation than ever before at leading edge. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand that we identified at our last Investor Day are even more relevant now than they were then and this will help us to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long-term operating leverage should provide consistent capital returns to our shareholders. And with that, I will pass the call over to Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. KLA’s December quarter and 2020 results highlight the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to demonstrate our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating record free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of productive capital allocation. 2020 was a year of strong growth and profitability across multiple areas of our business. All of this was accomplished while simultaneously continuing to return high levels of capital to shareholders. Total revenue in the December quarter was $1.65 billion, a very top of the guided range for the quarter of $1.51 billion to $1.66 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%, slightly below the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter of 61% to 63%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.24, probably, above the midpoint of the guided range of $2.82 to $3.46. GAAP EPS was $2.94. At the guided tax rate of 13%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $3.27. Total operating expenses were above the guided range of $393 million, including $228 million of R&D expense and $165 million of SG&A. Non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue was strong at 38% and in line with expectations. The higher operating expenses in the quarter were due in part to adjustments in variable compensation programs, as well as the timing of prototype material purchases for product development programs. Based on revenue expectations for 2021, product development requirements, particularly in programs supporting next-generation reticle inspection capabilities and the regionalization of additional customer engagement resources, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $400 million in the March quarter and we are budgeting quarterly operating expenses roughly within the range of $400 million to $405 million over the near-term horizon. Given topline expectations for 2021, we expect that the business will continue to outperform its target operating model in terms of overall profitability and operating margin leverage. Other interest and expense in the December quarter was $43 million and the effective tax rate was 13.8%. Though we always have some variability in our tax rate given the timing and impact of discrete items and the geographic distribution of revenue and profit, we believe it is prudent to adjust our long-term tax planning rate up slightly to 13.5% going forward. Of course, we are monitoring the corporate tax discussions in the United States and we will provide updates on how those will affect or would affect KLA as appropriate in the future. Non-GAAP net income was $504 million, GAAP net income was $457 million, cash flow from operations was $561 million and free cash flow was a record at $502 million. This resulted in the free cash flow conversion of nearly 100% and a very healthy free cash flow margin of just over 30%. Our segment revenue was strong in the quarter, driven by growth in our Semiconductor Process Control business. The EPC Group delivered results in line with our model heading into the quarter. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment including its associated Service business was $1.38 billion, a sequential quarterly increase of 9% and up 15% for 2020. Approximate customer segment mix is as follows; foundry was strong as expected at 49%, logic was 10% and memory grew to 41% from 32% in the December quarter. Within memory, the business was roughly 60% NAND and 40% DRAM. Going forward, we will be combining the foundry and logic segments into one category to remove some of the noise as to whether our customers in one category or another given the various markets they serve and to better align with industry-reporting practices. Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment in December was $91 million, up 2% sequentially and up 24% in 2020. Demand in this segment was driven by growth in RF, MEMS, and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $179 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 12% for 2020, as strength in PCB and component inspection offset a weaker business environment in the display business. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.46 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, during the December quarter, we repurchased $177 million of common stock and paid $140 million in dividends. In 2020, KLA return $1.2 billion to shareholders or 70% of free cash flow, including $547 million in dividends paid and $681 million and share repurchases. We believe our track record for delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As it relates to guidance as we begin the New Year, our view is that the fab -- wafer fab equipment or WFE market will grow in the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of percentage points in 2021 off a baseline of $59 billion to $60 billion. 2021 is expected to be a year of strong demand and growth across our major end markets with the strongest percentage growth coming in memory led by DRAM investment and with foundry/logic delivering another year of solid growth. Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters and product lead times, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the year. As a result, we would expect the company revenue to be roughly consistent quarter-to-quarter across the year. Our March quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.74 billion, plus or minus $75 million; foundry/logic is forecasted to be about 68% of semi process control systems’ revenue; memory is expected to be approximately 32%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61.25% to 63.25%, as we expect a richer product mix, continued service leverage and higher volume will lead to improved gross margins compared to the December quarter. Based on revenue and product mix expectations for 2021, we are modeling gross margins between 61.5% and 62% in 2021. Given the structural trends in our business in both cost and product positioning, my bias today is to the high end of this range. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $400 million, interest and other expense of approximately $43 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.98 to $3.66 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $3.23 to $3.91. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately $155 million shares. In closing, the end market dynamics driving semiconductors and investments in WFE remain compelling, with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. 2021 is setting up to be a second consecutive year of double-digit growth for both WFE and KLA. KLA is executing well with continued confidence that we are on track to meet and likely exceed our 2023 financial targets. The KLA operating model positions us well to outperform and also guide our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, if you could provide the instructions for Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much and a belated Happy New Year and congrats to you guys. Rick, maybe first off, in terms of process control intensity, we have seen foundry and logic continue to grow as we go through these node migrations. And NAND flash has obviously seen intensity rise with the increasing layer counts. As we look at DRAM and the projected pickup that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, what types of process control intensity increases are you seeing in that marketplace? Maybe even excluding some of the EUV options that are out there, what other types of process control intensity trends are increasing in DRAM?
Rick Wallace: Sure. I think that there -- if you think about DRAM, what they have really been pushing on and it’s very difficult as you know to do it is to continue scaling and we do think that there is going to be some EUV that comes in. But there is no question that there is scaling happening, and of course, that drives more process control intensity. The other thing that’s pretty clear in DRAM is the overlay requirements continue to get more and more challenging. So we are seeing increased -- trying to understand how to squeeze more capability out of the lithography sets that they have got. And then we do see some, as I say, EUV adoption. So we think there will be incrementally more focus on our more advanced optical inspection tools to be able to support that. So that’s what we are seeing as a trend. It’s not necessarily, obviously, as EUV-heavy as what we would see in foundry/logic, but there is some element of EUV in there. Does that answer your question, Patrick?
Patrick Ho: Hey. It does, Rick. Thank you. Bren, as a follow-up to that question, you guys as you are seeing demand pickup and revenues grow, your working capital metrics have actually also improved. What changes have you made, particularly given that you have added Orbotech over the last few years, but you see the inventory turns actually improving even as demand picks up. What are some of the dynamics there?
Bren Higgins: Well, hey, Patrick. It’s a great question. And certainly adding Orbotech in and I think we have done a pretty good job of improving overall asset velocity in that business so far. I think there is room for us to improve it going forward. But on the KLA side, one of the areas where you could argue that we -- I think we do something in our business to support and I think we get paid for in terms of our profitability, but to support our model. Both in terms of the component differentiation we have that drives our differentiation of our products but also that enables our service business. So we have always tended to carry a lot of inventory because we are supporting these tools that last a long time in the field. And we also have very exclusive relationships and a lot of our key supplier relationships that help us, as I said protect differentiation. So as a result of all that, it does drive higher inventory commitments and we carry that risk, if you will. Although, we never get stuck with extra systems and given the strength of the Service business we tend to move the part. So we think it’s a good sacrifice to make. We think we get paid for it in terms of the profitability and structure of our business. And the volume we have seen has allowed us to improve it a little bit. It’s -- this is not a turns business for the most part. So I think there’s probably an upper limit to it. But we have -- we do focus on and I think we have improved it a little bit over time.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to your comment about revenues should be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter in 2021. Is that a process control tool comment as well, I guess what I am trying to understand is, what you are seeing relative to maybe peers talking about WFE being a little bit more first half weighted?
Bren Higgins: Yeah. Joe, so it’s a good question. So what we are trying to do, first of all, it’s really for both groups of our business, if you look at the EPC Group and as well as the process control equipment part of the business. I was really trying to do a few things. First, obviously, we are guiding March and we have got a nice sequential increase to the March quarter. We wanted to provide our view of WFE growth for ‘21 and expectations for KLA in the year. And the third thing was to provide just some context on the demand profile as we move through the year. And as I said in the prepared remarks, it looks relatively consistent. Now I am not guiding the June quarter, I am not guiding September, I am not guiding December, but what I wanted to do is provide a little bit more context. Now we do have tools that cost from $10 million to $20 million, sometimes even more than that. So there is the usual variability that you have related to the timing of a shipment, the customer acceptance, the consignment buyout and so on. But when we look across our business, it looks relatively consistent from a demand profile point of view, and I think starting with the backlog we have, the visibility we have in the funnel and then just the general lead time dynamics of our products, it gives me some comfort with that statement.
Joe Quatrochi: Okay. That’s helpful. And then you talked about the other investments you are making on the product development side, and clearly, you guys are strongly outperforming your long-term profitability targets. I was curious, how do you think about opportunities to maybe even spend a little bit more and accelerate some of the product development projects you have got going on?
Bren Higgins: Sounds like you have been talking to some of our guys inside it. Sometimes Rick and I are the only two people in the company, I think, we ought to spend less. But anyway, to answer your question, look we have a rigorous process where we look at the portfolio of the business and look at how we get returns on that portfolio. So we have ramped up our investments in R&D and product development over the last few years. We think that there are opportunities. One of the biggest drivers that’s driving the uptick that I articulated here as we look at ‘21 is investment in multiple programs supporting reticle inspection, qualification and so on. So I think that that’s been an area of focus for us. But we feel pretty comfortable with our process around R&D and the timing of our road map related to our customer requirements and it’s worked pretty well for KLA. I think what’s driving more of our model upside is more of a gross margin dynamic than a cost dynamic. And so, I think, the gross margin is reflective of the differentiation that we have with our products in the field and I think the value we are adding to our customers. So hopefully that answers your question.
Joe Quatrochi: Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from CJ Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. I guess two questions if I could put them together. The first one would be around EUV shortages at ASML, is that impacting GEN5 optical demand at all? And then, I guess, secondly, I am a little bit surprised that you are guiding Orbotech business is flat half-on-half, typically there is a seasonal uplift into the back half. I am curious if that’s a conservative outlook, whether seasonality has changed or there is something that we should be kind of thinking about? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. CJ, nicely done, those are not related at all, those two questions, as you know. But I will take them. The first one, no, we don’t see any slowdown in the EUV impact if the delays that were outlined by ASML in terms of the demand for GEN5, if anything, it’s kind of gone the other way. What’s happened in the last few months is, I think, the realization that some of the yield challenges associated with the EUV are best approach -- best addressed by having more GEN5 capacity and so we are actually maxed out and trying to ramp that in order to support it. So we have very strong GEN5, we don’t see any delay in that and we have a lot of conversations with customers about our ability to support that. In terms of Orbotech, in terms of that, I would say, it’s a complicated business overall to aggregate and so we don’t really see anything, any signs of concern. We do see continued growth in that business. We feel good about where we set out our plans for 2023 in terms of the original model that we outlaid at the Investor Day and we are on track to meet or exceed those. So we feel good about it. We will have to see. This is a little bit newer for us to understand just the dynamics of the Orbotech business. But we feel good about the signs that we are seeing, and as we said, we ended with a strong backlog coming out of 2020. So we feel really good about this year.
Rick Wallace: So, CJ, the only thing that I will add to that is we were guiding it right. This still has the same variability you see quarter-to-quarter as is -- at a different obviously order of magnitude than our Semiconductor Process Control equipment business. But if you look at what’s driving the business overall between 5G infrastructure, mobile and 5G handsets, some of the dynamics within specialty, and then just all -- the overall PCB dynamics and how it’s changing relative to integration and packaging and high performance computing. It’s all of that is driving some nice growth in those businesses. So while the display business is, I expect a down year in ‘21 versus ‘20, the other businesses are more than making up for it. So I think that, overall, it looks pretty consistent more or less as we move through the year.
CJ Muse: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon and thanks for letting me ask the question. First one is for Bren. Bren, I am wondering if you just give a little bit more detail around what happened to mix in the December quarter that drill gross margins a little bit light relative to revenues being at the high end of the range and as we look out beyond March, are there any other mix considerations we should think about as we think about gross margins?
Bren Higgins: Yeah. John, it’s the usual quarter-to-quarter variability. So it was a little bit weaker in the December quarter and you see a bit of a bounce back into the March quarter. So we were 20 basis points below and we just guided 25 basis points over the midpoint or over that 62%. And as I look at the next several quarters and why I put the comments in the prepared remarks that I feel like we are operating in the 61.5% to 62% range. So it was really just a function of the products that actually revenue in the quarter. It’s a customer acceptance timing dynamic and not any other reason.
John Pitzer: Yeah. That’s helpful. And then, Rick, as my follow up, maybe I will go back to the memory question that Patrick asked first, but ask it a little bit differently. If we are doing the math right, December quarter memory was a new record. You have to go back to kind of June of 2018 to see memory this high, and as you know, we in the investment community always think about that space is being kind of hyper-cyclical. We are willing to underwrite some of the structural drivers in logic and foundry, maybe not as much in memory. When you look at the level of memory business today, how do you kind of parse out where we are in the quote-unquote CapEx cycle for memory versus some of the structural drivers you outlined in Patrick’s answer?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. John, I think, as you know, since we are a little more dependent on technology transition than we are at volume, our answer is a little different, because it has more to do with the migration and the yield challenges associated with advanced nodes and what we see there is a pretty steady commitment toward additional capability to drive next-generation and we are seeing that for multiple players. So I think like a lot of things in this industry KLA’s exposure is -- there is less variability in it based on that fact. And so the volume considerations associated with CapEx impact us less than that. And maybe Bren can give some color on how that looks for the -- as we go through the year.
Bren Higgins: Well, John, it was fairly weak for most of 2020 and we saw this increase in the December quarter, which had some breath to it and we expected to see that, so we weren’t surprised by it and then as we look at ‘21, we expect to see growth overall. We articulated our view earlier about just -- we think the DRAM market overall probably grows at a higher percentage level than in the flash market, but we would expect to see growth in the business into ‘21. But it’s been pretty disciplined. So seen it bounce back in the December quarter and some sustainability here at these levels as we move through the first part, at least here of ‘21, it’s encouraging.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them to Rick. Just to follow along the thought process on memory, it seems like KLA the way it is today is relatively more exposed to NAND than DRAM. Do you think that exposure or process control intensity increases in DRAM as DRAM goes more EUV? And if so, how should we think about KLA’s revenue mix and then I had a follow-up.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. I mean, I think, that the differences are pretty slight, in terms of what the drivers are. It’s actually different products that are getting impacted. So if you think about DRAM, we are more -- obviously scaling is more of a factor there and so you will see more of what we are doing in terms of whether it’s GEN5. You don’t really see that and what’s going on in NAND, but you do have some of the new products, we talked about the X-ray technology is really more applicable of that, some of the challenges associated with metrology. And even how it impacts our wafer business or Surfscan business, because the flatness requirements and the cleanliness for wafers for NAND really get exacerbated when you think about the kind of verticality that those dimensions are going through and the stress that puts on the semiconductor producer for them to be able to manage the yield. So they are different, I think the intensity at this point is slightly higher in the NAND than in the DRAM, but they are both kind of increasing at similar amounts.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it.
Bren Higgins: Krish, the only thing I would add on DRAM is, with the introduction of EUV and want to see how that plays out, it does drive some infrastructure. Now that’s one level of investment and is that sustainable over time is I think a challenge for our teams. But as customers start to deploy EUV, it will require EUV related infrastructure to help manage that. So that’s a factor that’s out there that also a -- maybe a change moving forward.
Krish Sankar: Fair enough, Bren. And then another follow up for you on Services. In the shareholder letter, you spoke about how the Services attach rate grew from 70% to over 75% through the course of last year. I am just curious how high can it realistically get or put it another way, Service is running at 25% of total sales, can it get to over 30%? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Well, Krish, it will. It’s two separate questions. It will because it’s growing faster than the underlying systems business. If you look at our service model, it’s a 9% to 11% growth rate, which is what we articulated at Investor Day and I’d argue that, certainly, the increase in demand we have seen on the system side gives us a tailwind to that growth rate moving forward. There is clearly customers are valuing the service offerings particularly as you are seeing more and more demand at the trailing edge and that with the need for those customers to keep those tools up. A lot of those customers, particularly around automotive are facing increasing reliability requirements and that’s driving more investment and process control and the information that comes off the tools. So those have all been good drivers for us. So I keep thinking -- look 80%, 85%, I think, that’s probably reasonable to think that we could aspire to get there. There is always dynamics of certain customers that prefer billable model and so we will have to deal with that resistance to try to move to a contract structure. At the end of the day, contract structures allow us to optimize the cost structure underneath and we can serve to an entitlement level that drives higher through cycle profitability. So that’s what we aspire to. So I think there’s opportunities but I think there’s always going to be some limit to it where customers are going to -- some customers will prefers a total structure in parts of their installed base.
Rick Wallace: Just to add to that, I mean, one other factor is the tools that are being shipped today, the complexity is such that if you think about a car analogy, it’s pretty much service your own car today, 15 years ago it might have been different. And so you think about over time, the complexity in the associative, more and more of our systems end up having more and more custom design parts throughout the system and it just becomes more economical to rely on us. And then there is no question that a service model -- a customer benefits from having a contract over the long-term. They take the risk out of episodic events and they have more reliability of uptime. So I agree with, Bren, I think it goes up over time. But nothing moves particularly fast in the Services world given the size of the installed base. So it takes a little time for that number to keep creeping up. But we are firmly convinced and committed to driving it.
Krish Sankar: Very helpful. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Bren.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I had two as well. First is, if I take your March quarter outlook and annualize it, it suggests this calendar year growth in line with WFE growth. But when I look at some of the investments that are being made and 5-nanometer and then 3-nanometer on the foundry side and then the DRAM, which is more kind of logic like. I am curious what are the prospects of outgrowing WFE? I guess it’s the process control intensity question just asked in a different way, like, what would help you grow above or below WFE this year?
Rick Wallace: So when I look at it, Vivek, I think, that there is -- we have a little bit more memory investment this year than in ‘20 and so that puts downward pressure on process control intensity. But you are right about the opportunities in foundry/logic and some of the product offerings that we expect to have over the course of 2021. So when I look at it and I think that we will at least perform in line with the market. I would expect that we will probably do a little bit better. There’s some headwinds and some tailwinds as we look at ‘21. But overall, I think that that’s where process control intensity kind of plays out. And then from a share if we execute, I think, there’s probably some opportunities for some modest share improvement as well. So I do think KLA’s share of WFE is probably flat to slightly up as we look at ‘21 from where we sit today.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And a follow up is a question on cash returns to shareholders, your profitability is very analog semi like, right, almost 37%, 38% operating margins, but free cash flow returns are -- do leave a lot more room for improvement, even when I look at the buybacks that you had in December, they were somewhat lower than the average we have seen in the last two years. So I am curious, how are you looking at cash returns going forward, if you are going to have such strong growth this year and the longer term trends are there, why not look at 100% free cash flow returns and looking at boosting dividends or the buyback?
Bren Higgins: Well, so if you go back to Investor Day, and I think, even over time it, every time we get the question, we have been very explicit about how we think about the -- about capital allocation in the company and our belief that generally cash doesn’t get valued unless it’s deployed productively. And so when you look at what we are doing going forward, we expect that, at a minimum, we would be able to return 70% and investors can model that as they think about the returns profile over time. We were right around that this year, but this was a little bit of a unique year with some of the COVID dynamics at the beginning of the year. We did build our cash balance a little bit. But you are right, given the growth of the business I would expect that we can deploy more. We do an exhaustive exercise here to understand the liquidity of the company and how much cash we need to run it and we are operating at that level today and so we have to juxtapose those alternatives against opportunities for growth in the company. I think we have done a pretty good job with that. But generally, I think the 70% tends to be a floor, and given the uptick in the business that we are describing, I would expect our quarter-to-quarter share repurchasing to increase as we go forward here. Now, on the dividend side, A, we have raised it 11 years in a row, 35% or so payout ratio target through cycle to enable us to continue to raise it year in, year out and have a payout ratio that gives us the ability to do that and even raise it in difficult years. We are going to grow it in line with the growth rate in free cash flow. And so over time, you can expect that the dividend payout ratio will grow roughly in line with the growth in free cash flow. So that’s our model and we will -- we do our exercise here and each year and we will continue to do it that way, I don’t think anything’s changed.
Vivek Arya: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you for taking my question. My first question is on China. I think China was -- if my math is right, the Chinese revenue was down about 20% quarter-over-quarter after pretty good third quarter but still up very solidly for the year by 20%. What are your expectations for your opportunity in China this year?
Bren Higgins: So, I would expect WFE in China to be flat to up. I am looking at our business levels and they match that. So it -- I would say, it’s very consistent with the profile of 20%, maybe a little bit better and it’s different customers...
Sidney Ho: Okay.
Bren Higgins: …that are investing. But in general, that’s how we see it.
Sidney Ho: Okay. Great. Maybe my follow-up question is related to your target model. You printed operating margin 38%, guiding up to 39% plus, well ahead of your target model and it sounds like you are comfortable with that, you will continue to exceed that. But are there things that we should be aware of that may bring down operating margin as your revenue continue to grow either in next few years in terms of either cost of goods sold side of things, gross margin obviously, offerings expenses side, then we try to normalize a little bit over the next few years? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Well, there is always quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. But when you look at our long-term plan of growing our top line at least in the 7% to 9% range and dropping 1.5 times that revenue growth rate in terms of EPS growth. But that drives effectively an incremental operating margin that’s between 40% and 50% and that’s how we are going to run the company over time. So you always have the drivers that influence margin -- your gross margin, whether it’s a product mix, obviously, service has a dilutive element at the gross margin line. But we factor that into how we think about the model we put out there. So, yes, we are outperforming the public model. I think the strength and the speed of the growth that we have seen in the last couple of years has helped drive a fair amount of leverage in the business. And I think that a lot of, as I said earlier and said in the prepared remarks, a lot of its sustainable. So that’s our model and we are outperforming it and expect to over the next number of quarters as I outlined.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, guys. Thanks a lot. Bren, I am sorry, you might have already talked about this, but I actually jumped on late. So it seems like if you are going to hold WFE share pretty flat, which I think is pretty reasonable in the 6.3% or 6.4% range. It seems like process control shipments are going to be or revenue is going to be in the 1.05% range for March and then it’s going to sort of stay in that range throughout the rest of the year. So you are not going to see this pronounced half-on-half decline that maybe some others will. Is that sort of the right way to think about the semis process piece?
Bren Higgins: So, Tim, yeah, you missed it. I covered it earlier and there were some prepared remarks that I had that were about a sustained or a consistent demand profile over the next number of quarters. So that isn’t guidance but that was just to give some context on how we see the year shaping up. Notwithstanding the issue that we have around, just general ASPs of our tools that can cause some variability quarter-to-quarter. If you look at the March quarter, and again, we run the -- we guide one revenue number, but my expectations around the semi process control business are somewhere between 1.435% and 1.455% including Service, somewhere in that ballpark.
Timothy Arcuri: Including service. Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yeah.
Timothy Arcuri: And then, I had a question on NAND, so I know you don’t have a ton of visibility there. But your commentary that NAND is going to be sort of the weakest in terms of the relative end markets on a year-over-year basis this year is kind of interesting. I think some others are beginning to try to say the same thing, it sounds like about flat as the growing consensus. There was a pretty big budget flush from one of the big customers in the fourth quarter, so that was higher. But I guess my question is, is your view on NAND is it, because things have been cut, so because the procurement has been cut later on in the year as to why it’s flat or is it because the number’s the same, it’s just as off of the bigger base in 2020? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. I think there is some growth in NAND. It’s the lowest percentage growth rate of the three segments that we articulated. So I think it’s probably a mid-single-digit type growth rate and that’s obviously off a bigger base as we look at ‘21.
Timothy Arcuri: But it’s not because things have been cut, Bren, that’s what I guess.
Bren Higgins: No.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay.
Bren Higgins: I am not so sure I understand the question. But I think it’s been fairly consistent I think here. I think it upticked a little bit in the second half to your point and I think that there is some growth next year off of ‘20.
Timothy Arcuri: Cool. Okay. Thanks so much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. In 2019 in Semiconductor Process Control, you guys gained about 300 basis points of share on the systems side. Revenue-wise you were about 5 times larger than your nearest competitor. It looks like your process control systems business grew about 17% in 2020. Do you guys think you sustained or gained overall process control market share in 2020 and then what areas do you think you drove the most share gains, then on your view of double-digit percentage revenue growth in 2021, what are going to be the fastest growing segments within process control?
Rick Wallace: Harlan, I think, it kind of -- there’s kind of two ways to answer it. What were the end drivers for it and what were the products. And I say that because EUV really drove a lot of our BBP performance, but it isn’t necessarily the only thing BBP is used for. So we feel good about how we finished up the year. As you said, we gained share and we feel like we held it. We will see what the final numbers come out. But you remember, Investor Day we are modeling a slower growth in share than what we are actually seeing. So we feel really good about...
Harlan Sur: Right.
Rick Wallace: …where we are in terms of the BBP adoption and had a very strong year in optical inspection in calendar ‘20. As you shift to ‘21, we feel like we are well-positioned to continue to build on the share gains or process control adoption gains that we had. Again, based as much on end demand as some products that are coming to market that will continue to build that, plus continued adoption. The optical inspection strength is really remarkable and we feel good about how we are positioned there. So I think that you are right, we gained more in ‘19 than in 2020. We held our gains may be built on it a little and I think we are positioned to continue that trajectory as we go towards our ‘23 plan but, certainly, for ‘21. That’s the way the year’s lining up. That’s we are build plans look right now.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. The product families overall…
Harlan Sur: Yeah. Thanks.
Bren Higgins: …all of them are showing growth. I would think that Rick talked a lot about the broadband plasma in the strength there. Because of the memory uptick we are seeing and after a couple of years now of digesting, we are seeing more patterned inspection or unpatterned inspection investment and so that’s a good indicator both to support the wafer output, but also which memory tends to drive wafer so that drives that business. And then the tool monitoring that is done with un-patterned inspectors for any monitor wafers in memory. And then in reticle inspection, I expect to see growth year-over-year above market kind of growth levels in that business as well.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insight there. And on the EPC side, I spot very good diversification to the business. Going back to the 2019 Analyst Day, the team’s outlook for EPC was kind of like a 9% to 10% CAGR, $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion in revenues in 2023. Based on the results that you put up in 2020, looks like you guys grew that business about 10%, 11%, if you included the full quarter of Orbotech in your March 2019 quarter. So we can see the team tracking to or slightly ahead of those targets. What sort of growth are you guys expecting for EPC this year, would it be more in line with that 9% to 10% CAGR that you have been targeting or could it be more in line with the overall topline growth of sort of mid-teens and what segments are going to be driving the largest growth in any segments that will lag the growth?
Rick Wallace: Sure. Harlan, great question. We do feel good about where we are positioned. And as you know, I think we are fully integrated now and feel really good about the message we have for our customers. I mentioned in prepared remarks, we feel good about the progress we have made on the synergies. We have seen the target that we laid out in 2023, we are on track. But to your point and Bren mentioned it, FPD will be down in calendar ‘21, which means -- and we think overall, the rest of the business if you take out FPD probably be up closer to 15%. So -- and FPD was relatively weak in ‘20. So the parts of the business that were I think the most levered to in terms of the advanced packaging and a lot of the work that’s going on, where we have overlap with some of our existing front-end customers, really a lot of good progress, and as you know, Oreste is running that. I think he’s confident that we can build on our success as we go forward, based on the interactions that we are having with customers. We feel good about specialty, PCB has been great and we have been really happy with the work that’s going on in the packaging inspection, the ICOS businesses. So those three are really hitting it and feel really good about it. I also mentioned, we are seeing the same operating margin leverage. Obviously those are lower profitability businesses but they have the same leverage in the operating model as the rest of KLA. So we feel good about that as well.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Harlan. Priscilla, looks like we are coming up on time here, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator: We will take our final question today from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Someone addressed it in answering Harlan’s question there, but I was looking at the wafer inspection business up 32%. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on what’s driving that strength. Is it mostly GEN5? Is it Surfscan? And in the script, I think, you also mentioned some new applications in optical inspection? So I was just looking for some more color there.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. It’s really related, Quinn, to the optical inspection in GEN4, GEN5. So it’s not just what we are seeing in GEN5. But GEN5 is certainly where we are seeing the increased application around specifically supporting EUV. And there -- that’s -- we laid out that thesis at Investor Day. We haven’t really seen it at that time that we thought the print check. So when customers will print down the EUV and they will validate that image that was going to be an application. We believe there is a big market requirement for. That’s proving to be true and that’s driving a lot of the business success going forward. The other thing that’s happening, of course, as EUV is becoming more prevalent then just in general scaling matters more smaller defects and that pushes the mix toward more GEN5 than perhaps would have been GEN4. So we are benefiting from both of those trends, new applications, additional scaling.
Quinn Bolton: Got it. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: All right. We appreciate everybody’s time and interest. And I will pass the call back over to Priscilla to end.
Operator: This concludes the KLA Corporation December quarter 2020 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2020-10-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. My name is Priscilla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome to the KLA Corporation First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants’ lines have been placed on listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Priscilla and welcome to KLA’s fiscal Q1 2021 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of the September quarter and our outlook for the December quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today’s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2020 that we released today after the market closed in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All of these documents can be found on the IR section of our Website. Today’s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today’s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR Web site. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information including our quiet period policy and links to KLA’s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks and KLA can not guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. We changed the format of these calls last quarter to include pre-publishing a shareholders letter that provide deeper insights into our business. We will also start by providing some streamlined highlights from our full prepared remarks, while still providing more time overall for your questions and answers. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick?
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin, and welcome to everyone joining us today. As we rapidly approach the end of the calendar year, it's amazing when I stopped to think how much has changed over the last 12 months. I hope you and your families are safe and in good health and I appreciate your continued interest in and support for our company. I want to make sure I begin my remarks today by conveying my appreciation to the worldwide KLA team. It's your perseverance, strive to be better and determination that exemplify KLA's core values and enable us once again to meet our commitments and to deliver exceptionally strong financial performance in the September quarter. On behalf of the entire KLA executive team, I want to thank you. In this quarter's Shareholder Letter that was published today, we highlighted how our results demonstrate the resourcefulness of our global workforce, the resiliency of our business model and our continued commitment to returning value to our shareholders. As many of you may have already seen, our September quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS both finished at the upper end of our guidance, a result of continued strong demand from customers, exceptional execution by our global teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model in guiding our strategic objectives. I'm pleased to say that, we are continuing this momentum into the December quarter and nearing the end of what truly has been an unprecedented year in calendar 2020. Most importantly, we are executing at a high level, operating from a position of strength in our marketplace and are solidly on track to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. In terms of the resourcefulness of our global workforce, we just completed the third quarter of operating through a pandemic. COVID-19 has presented an unexpected opportunity to showcase KLA’s resilience and resourcefulness in these unprecedented times. We have begun proactively taking steps to mitigate disruption in our business and remain vigilant of the risk posed by the virus to our people. We've done this by adopting strict safety protocols to protect our workforce, while innovating new ways to collaborate with customers and partners. As demonstrated by our strong performance throughout 2020, we are successfully meeting customer needs, executing our R&D roadmap and operating our worldwide manufacturing facilities efficiently. We continue to evaluate and adapt at various facilities in accordance with local regulation, prioritizing employee health and safety. Our worldwide teams deserve praise for never losing sight of what our customers want and need to improve their businesses, and to drive better yield management. We benefited from them being exceptionally resourceful and as always remain committed to customer satisfaction and meeting our commitments. While we consider the challenges our worldwide teams are facing today, we recognize that they extend well beyond the workplace, which makes us intently focused on ensuring that we're supporting our teams and our people in every possible way. Lastly, investment in long term remains an important priority for us. We're confident that our R&D programs will help strengthen our technology and market leadership. And we’re gratified by the effectiveness of our business continuity actions, which have allowed R&D activities to adapt, although ,not without challenges, and to continue through this pandemic. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. In the September quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control revenue was solidly above plan and our services business delivered strong operating leverage and is on track to deliver double digit growth in 2020. We also ended the quarter with strong backlog, reflecting the enabling role KLA plays in our customers’ technology roadmap and investment. Driven by the circular industry trends and the ongoing commitment by our customers to invest in R&D for next generation technology, the stage is set for KLA’s outdoor market in calendar 2020. Today's environment continues to accelerate the adoption of several industry growth drivers that we originally outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. The integration of digital technology into our lives is transforming the way we live and work, resulting in fundamentally change to how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. This digital transformation is fueling secular demand drivers, such as high performance computing, artificial intelligence and accelerated migration to the cloud from on-prem applications, as well as 5G communication, driving investments and innovation in advanced memory and logic device technologies. Process control is on the critical path of enabling this digital transformation, driving our growth and long term revenue and profitability. And the addition of the Orbotech in 2019 to our business portfolio has expanded our exposure to the compelling industry trends. We’re all driving this all important digital transformation in our own business as well, including adopting new productivity tools to improve collaboration with our global teams and customers. For example, our customer service organization has been working closely with customers to expand remote service technologies, which augment our in country service and installation engineers. We’ve also recently adopted and integrated a new cloud based platform for managing our global HR management system that should continue to benefit us as we scale. Finally, we're also integrating cloud based manufacturing and service planning tools to increase the visibility of our parts demand to our suppliers and to allow us to more proactively respond to customer service requirements. Here's just a few examples of the accelerated digital transformation that we ourselves are experiencing inside of KLA as we adapt to this new environment. Here are five top highlights from our most recent quarter. First, as expected, we saw continued strength and breadth in foundry and logic demand in the September quarter. These customers are benefiting from investment in digital transformation to support the secular growth drivers that we mentioned earlier. And we expect this demand to remain healthy in 2021. In memory, total utilization is high and memory customers continue to drive down device inventories and plan for higher bit growth in 2021 to meet expected improvement and then demand. We expect higher business levels across a broader range of customers in December quarter with momentum continuing into 2021. Second, we ended the quarter with strong backlog, demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across multiple product platforms in both the semiconductor process control and EPC groups, fueled by new applications in our optical inspection portfolio, such as EUV print check for Gen5 and the success of our new offerings, including the eSL10, e-beam inspection platform, we're seeing strong adoption of our patterned wafer inspection product suite, driving our market leadership and what we expect will be a year of growth for process control. Third, our service business continues to perform well and is positioned for double digit growth in 2020. KLA's service revenue is 25% of the total quarterly and is delivering long term growth at a rate that's double the underlying industry WFE growth rate. Fourth, it was another strong quarter for Electronics Packaging and Components group, or EPC, highlighted by the record demand of our PCB division. The strong growth in PCB was driven by EPC's high exposure to the 5G infrastructure and smartphone market. SPTS and ICOS divisions are also benefiting from the transition to 5G along with increasingly the more complex advanced semiconductor packaging. Finally, in keeping with our commitments to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders, we announced back in July that our Board of Directors approved our 11th consecutive annual dividend increase. During the September quarter, we returned $329 million to investors via dividends and buybacks. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. Before I hand it over to Bren to get into greater detail on our financial highlights, let me briefly summarize. Despite the disruption and unforeseen challenges in the year associated with the pandemic, KLA has benefited from the resourcefulness of our global workforce. We have adapted well and we're very well positioned for a strong finish to 2020. This demonstrates the critical nature of our products and services in enabling the digital transformations of our lives, the resiliency of our business model and return value to our shareholders. We believe the secular factors driving our industry demand that we identified at last year's Investor Day are as relevant now as they were then, and they'll help us enable us to achieve our 2023 financial targets. At the same time, our strategy of driving diversified growth with strong long term operating leverage should yield consistent returns for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thanks Rick and good afternoon, everyone. KLA's September quarter results once again demonstrated both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We continue to exhibit our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while growing operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining robust capital return strategy. Total revenue was $1.54 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.1%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.03 at the high end of the guided range of $2.42 to $3.06. GAAP EPS was $2.69. Gross margin at 62.1% was 60 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, as higher semiconductor process control product mix, lower inventory reserve requirements due to strengthening demand and services leveraged, drove the upside realized in the quarter. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, including its associated service business was $1.27 billion. In terms of approximate customer segment mix of process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers, foundry was strong as expected at 59%, logic was 10% and memory was 31% in the September quarter. Within memory, the business was split roughly two thirds DRAM and one third NAND. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was $89 million, down 11% sequentially but up 29% year-over-year. Demand in this segment is driven by growth in RF, MEMs and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $181 million, down 10% sequentially but up 1% year-over-year. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2.04 billion in total cash, total debt of $3.45 billion after retiring $50 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $456 million in the September quarter, free cash flow conversion was 96.1% and free cash flow margin was 29.7%. For capital returns, over the past 12 months, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders or 82% of free cash flow, including $542 million in dividends paid and $789 million in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we repurchased $188 million of common stock and paid $141 million in dividends. As it relates to guidance, our view for WFE growth this year is approximately 10%, growing off a baseline of $52 billion to $53 billion in 2019. Given this and our outlook for revenue growth in the calendar fourth quarter, KLA is in position once again to outgrow our industry. Looking forward, no early based on our current backlog and sales funnel visibility over the next couple of quarters, we are encouraged by the sustainability of our current demand profile for the first half of calendar '21. We will have more to say about our views of '21 WFE in our January earnings report. Before turning to our specific December quarter guidance, we'd like to comment on the current trade situation regarding United States and China. As you all know, in the September quarter, the US Department of Commerce stated that SMIC, or SMIC, may pose an unacceptable risk of diversion to a military end-use in China. So we must obtain an export license prior to shipping certain systems and spare parts to SMIC and certain related parties that are subject to the US export administration regulations. This new license requirement did not have any effect on any shipments in the September quarter. We are complying with the new rules and have already applied for licenses for expected shipments in the December quarter. Given the expected level of business in the quarter subject to license requirements, the result of the license requirements will not have a material impact on revenue. And as a result, we have made no adjustments for this situation to our plans or guidance ranges. The trade situation remains fluid and we've done our best to give you our perspective on the impact to our business and we’ll refrain from speculating on the situation further. Our December quarter guidance is as follows; total revenue is expected to be in a range of $1.585 billion plus or minus $75 million; Foundry is forecasted to be about 52% of semiconductor process control systems revenues for semiconductor customers, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst the foundry customer base; Memory is expected to grow to be approximately 37%: Logic is expected to be about 11%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 61% to 63% as we expect similar product mix and services leverage as in the September quarter. The market reception to product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong. And as outlined at our Investor Day last year, the company has made solid progress in our plans at driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. In addition, better than modeled gross margin improvement in acquired businesses is a tailwind to our gross margins overall. Other model assumptions include; operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest in other expenses of approximately $42 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 13%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.59 to $3.23 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.82 to $3.46, or $3.14 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. In closing, KLA is executing well with increasing confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed our 2023 target model, both in terms of top line growth and profitability. Growth in semiconductor revenue looks compelling over the long run with solid demand across end markets and at multiple technology nodes. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fill our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across increasingly more diverse product and service offering. They also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive moat and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin?
Kevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Priscilla, I think we're ready for you to queue for questions, please provide instructions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Congratulations I just wanted to follow-up, Bren, on your commentary around China. You said the results of licenses will not have a material impact on the December quarter revenue. Is that because you've already adjusted for it in your guidance or you just don't think that most of your shipments to SMIC require a license? And in that same vein, just given that China continues to be extremely strong, I think one of the key investor concerns out there is that the fear of bands are causing customers to pull forward. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the mix of your China business between domestic and multinational and kind of that concern of pull forward?
Bren Higgins: So on the SMIC situation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've applied for licenses for the December quarter where we think we need them. And if you look at just overall, I mean, SMIC, just for some background, it's an important customer but not a particularly large one. And over the last six months or so we've been discussing a broadening of investment. And certainly, they participated in that. There's probably timing factors that are involved in terms of how others are seeing this business come in over the course over the year. But as we look at what we revenued in the September quarter and where there was no effect and then we look at the December quarter, we've applied for licenses, as I said, where we need them. And at the end of the day, when we look at the overall expectation of revenue on our business for the quarter, we just don't see it having a material impact. So we didn't have to adjust anything, frankly. So our plans are consistent overall. So there's no change there. On your second question really difficult in our business. I mean, certainly, demand overall has been very strong. And so when you have a customer try to pull in a delivery, it means that they're taking a slot from another customer. And given the overall demand profile, that is -- most of the customers are sticking with their slots. So we haven't really seen a change. We've been, I think, fairly consistent in our view of shipments for the year of about $800 million. It's been second half loaded. It's what we are seeing today. So I haven't seen much of a change overall in terms of the behavior for customers, at least in regards to our products.
Operator: And we will take our next question today from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and strong results. On the innovation and new product front, there's a good correlation in years where the team rolls out new tools and platforms and then the forward revenue momentum for the next few years. Last year, you guys I think launched about 10 new tools or platforms, second iteration of your Gen5, your new X-ray metrology platform, e-beam inspection platform and also your multi column e-beam inspection for mask inspection, just to kind of name a few. Are these platforms contributing to the incremental upside in revenue performance this year? And how many new platforms do you guys have in development and/or will be introducing over the next 12 months?
Rick Wallace: As you might imagine, these programs are at different points in their life cycle. So yes, we have seen contribution. For example, we talked about print check for EUV with the BBP platform, and that's been a continuation and a broadening of that demand. In other cases, we've talked recently about where we are in terms of the X-ray metrology product or the multi-beam reticle tool. Those are not contributing in a material way to the revenue in the near term, but those are products that we do expect to fuel our growth in '21 and beyond in support of the 2023 plan. In terms of how many programs we have under development, we have a number as always of significant investments going on. But as you might imagine, there are various phases of introduction. But when we laid out our 2023 plan, we're pretty confident that the programs that we've got in place and the ones that are under development are where they need to be in order to support the 2023 plan. The challenges of some of those, as you might imagine, there have been some COVID challenges, which maybe hit us harder early in COVID. And then we -- in terms of program execution. But we feel like we've made great progress in terms of navigating that. And we feel good about where we are, which is why we say we're on track to meet or exceed the '23 plans that we laid on. Bren, do you want to add to that?
Bren Higgins: Harlan, I think one of the things that we're pretty excited about is that over the last year or so, we've introduced platforms in a lot of our core businesses. And those platforms have had really strong market perception. We think you mentioned Gen 5, but also new iterations of the Gen 4 product line and customers mix and matching across both tool sets and supporting a wide variety of designs and different process flows, which has been great for the business. But new laser scattering offerings, you mentioned e-beam, we have a new e-beam inspection product. And the portfolio strategy of the company, as we connect those tools and we leverage common interfaces and common algos, common software, it's been able to, I think, provide a pretty competitive offering out there in the marketplace. And so we've been able to maintain our share. We grew share in 2019. We think we're going to maintain that in '20, maybe improve it a little bit and been able to do it at very strong margins. So certainly, growth in the overall business is a factor there but also the product position is a factor. So we're pretty pleased with what's out in the marketplace. And to Rick's point, we've got some new things coming down the pipe that hopefully will drive our performance against our '23 targets.
Operator: We will go next to C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: I guess, I was hoping perhaps you could speak a little bit about the confidence that you have on sustainable spending in the first half of '21. And in particular, I would love to hear your thoughts around foundry and logic contributions. And as part of that, if you could touch on what impact if at all you might see if we see greater spend on 5-nanometer versus 3-nanometer at TSMC? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: As we said in the prepared remarks, we had very strong backlog coming into the quarter. We had a positive book to bill this quarter. And if we look at the funnel of expectations into the December quarter, just the overall order outlook as we look into December and into March and then the backlog position we believe will take into the year, gives us some confidence of sustainability of these business levels. And so while it's early for us to spend a lot of time sizing '21, and we'll have more to say about ‘21 in the next earnings call in January, that overall position gives us confidence that we'll see some sustainability here. From a foundry/logic point of view when you look at the overall market, and there are puts and takes there. But we are pretty confident in the fact that foundry/logic looks like that it has sustainability as we move into the first half of the year, I don't see it changing. Obviously, quarter-to-quarter there's always fluctuation. But in general feel very good about the profile of that business as we move in the first half.
Bren Higgins: And just one thing to add, C.J. I think one of the beliefs and our investment thesis on some of our new capabilities, for example, EUV print check, was that we were going to be highly relevant in the advanced nodes. But of course, people really hadn't hit much volume. So we've really seen proof of that concept. And we're getting a lot of customer pull for capacity and capability to support those ramps, and it's not just at one customer. So we feel very good about the process control intensity expectations that we had going into these nodes. We're seeing them being realized. So we view that as another positive indicator, not just on the overall foundry spend but on the process control related spend.
Richk Wallace: We would expect Gen 5 to have some growth next year in wafer starts and we also expect to see some, what we call mini line risk production type investment on N3 more towards the middle of the year end, into the second half.
Operator: Thank you. And we will move to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: I had a question for Rick or Bren. You guys mentioned in your prepared comments memory should see growth next year. I understand you're going to give more color in January. But just within that context, how would you expect KLA revenues to trend? The reason I'm asking is there's a general view that within the memory vertical, KLA has more exposure to NAND than DRAM. So I'm kind of curious to hear your thoughts on '21 memory and KLA's performance.
Bren Higgins: Really, since the middle of 2018 or so, we've seen very disciplined spending by our memory customers. And so we've seen that continue through after a strong down year in 2019 to a flattish year here in 2020. We see some modest recovery here in the December quarter as you see from the disclosures we gave for the quarter. And we see that continuing as we move into next year. I don't see -- just if you look at the overall pricing environment and certainly the smartphone and timing of data center recovery, we'll have an impact on the overall memory environment. You've got EUV introduction into DRAM, which could be a factor as well as we move into the second half of the year that we would expect to see memory as an improving business for us as we move into '21. As I said, I think that the discipline has been there. And as we start to see pricing recover, I think you'll see more investment there. But I wouldn't say it's a huge expectation in terms of growth but I think a lot of it will be dependent on some of the end market dynamics that I mentioned. From a process control intensity point of view, it's a little bit higher today in 3D flash than DRAM, although the introduction of EUV and DRAM is an opportunity for us to drive process control intensity. So I think we're optimistic about that when we start to see that play out. And then also as stacks, layer counts increase in flash that we will see more opportunities for our metrology product lines. We've got some new product offerings. We also have the e-beam inspection tools. We talked about where things that we believe will ultimately create some opportunities for us for either intensity improvement or share. So I think we're pretty optimistic about those opportunities.
Operator: And we will move next to Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Joe Moore: Sorry to go back to this, but I just want to make sure I understand the SMIC situation. Are you saying you didn't have exposure in the September quarter? And then, I guess, as you look at these rules, is there sort of an equal impact whether you ship out of the US or whether you ship out of Israel or Singapore?
Bren Higgins: In the September quarter, the change or the notification from the government came in at the very end of September. So there's no impact in the September quarter. And so as we look at the December quarter, as I said earlier, when we have to apply for licenses, we've applied for those. And we don't think that the granting of those licenses within the time frame we're talking about or not, will have a material impact on the business.
Joe Moore: And is there a difference as to where you ship out of it? Is it a different licensing process, whether you ship out of the US or from a foreign location?
Bren Higgins: Well, the licensing requirement is -- there isn't a licensing requirement that comes from a factor.
Operator: And we will go next to Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Rick or Bren, in terms of your PCB business, it's actually had a few strong quarters and you mentioned that 5G has been a big driver. You've given us the road map and a lot of the development on the process control area. Can you just talk about, I guess, the product road map on that business and because these type of tools typically have a long lifespan. When do you feel the need to call refresh and upgrade it for this next wave of line that's being driven by 5G?
Rick Wallace: It's a great question. And the answer is, we're relatively new to this business. So about year and half year, very impressed with what the Orbotech team had been doing. And I think in conjunction with them, we're really working hard to make sure we have the right amount of investment to continue new products meeting customer needs. And I would say that they had great engagement and we've added that. And as a result, we're investing heavily in that business to make sure that we're meeting some of the emerging demand, the flex PCB and all the new substrates, all the things. This is the beginning, as you know, of the 5G. And we think there's a continued opportunity for system growth over time. So we're very bullish on what that team has done. And in combination, we think it's been a tremendous success so far and a lot of upside as we go forward. But like KLA businesses, it requires continued investment in new capabilities and we're doing that right now.
Operator: And we will move next to Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I had a question about your Semi Systems business. If I sort of take your prior comments about the PCB and the Display business for calendar half-on-half, you said it would be down half-on-half. So that would imply that, that segment is sort of at best flat for December. And that's the biggest piece other than Semi Systems. So it seems like Semi Systems have to be up about 5% to like 9.35 to 9.40 for December? So I guess, A, is that right? And B, assuming it is, then your systems for the year are up about 10%, which is about in line with where we think WFE is? Yet you said that you're outgrowing the market. So I just wanted to see if you can fit those comments. Because it doesn't seem like you're really gaining WFE share this year, and you didn't gain anything last year either in a period where we've seen pretty big mix shifts toward foundry/logic. So I guess, can you sort of speak to that? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: A few questions in there, Tim, and I'll try to answer this for you. Yes, I mean your conclusion around December sequential Semi Systems is right, mid single digits. Obviously, we run the business at a total company level. But in terms of our expectations, it looks like it's sequentially a bit single digit growth here. And so when you take in aggregate, you add all that up that with our semi systems, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about 15% growth year-over-year against a market environment that's 10%. So that's an outperform. And if you look at last year, WFE was down about 7% and our Semi business was up 1%. So that's an outperform too in 2019. So we can spend some time with you on the math on all of this, but that's how to think about your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next to Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: Rick, if I look at inspection and measurement, industry sales attach rate to lithography sales historically, it makes a new high as industry introduces newer wave length. As you look at EUV now since introduction at 7-nanometer growing to 26 steps at 3-nanometer and some introduction at DRAM. Do you think the defect challenges associated with EUV remains a tailwind for your process control business or leveling off?
Rick Wallace: I think it's a good question. What we've seen so far, as you know, we're relatively conservative, but we have had indications and we believe earlier in EUV that we would see increased penetration of our advanced optical tools as well as in the mass shop. That's really playing out. So we do model process control intensity going up as a result of increased EUV adoption. And part of why that's working for us is, I mentioned EUV print check. That's essentially kind of a new category where we're able to deploy additional BBP tools to support the RAM of EUV. And as you might imagine, those wafers are incredibly expensive. So there's a a real focus by our customers to make sure that they're obviously optimizing their yield and catching excursions. At the same time, the size of the defect is becoming more relevant and smaller defects. So our tools end up having to run in modes where they capture smaller defects with increased algorithms, which also means that the capacity needs increase as the design rules go down in order to cover and detect. So yes, I would say that those are both tailwinds and our customers tell us that because they're very ambitious about ramping the advanced nodes and wanting to make sure we're in a position to support them. Does that answer your question?
Operator: We will go next to Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton: I wanted to first ask just the patterning business, up 21% sequentially. It looks like it had a pretty strong quarter. Wondering if you could highlight sort of what areas within pattern and really drove that growth? And then I've got a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Patterning overall, we had a strong quarter in reticle inspection. So quarter to quarter, that was the biggest driver.
Quinn Bolton: Do you expect that to continue or is that a fairly lumpy business?
Bren Higgins: Well, it's big ASPs. And so it's low integers and big ASPs. And so depending on timing, it does tend to be lumpy. Overall reticle inspection, because of the number of design starts in advanced foundry has been a really strong business for us. So I think that when we look at it overall, it was a very strong year in '19 and '20. It’s down a little bit from '19 in that business but still pretty strong. So I think those drivers will continue. And as we move into next year and we start to move into some of our offerings to support additional EUV activities, we should see some contribution from there as well. But reticle inspection was a driver. But to your point, it is lumpy quarter-to-quarter.
Quinn Bolton: Follow-up question, just ASML, in call you talked about some modulation in its EUV system deliveries given no transition timing of some of its customers. Wondering if you look into next year, do you see continued growth in EUV print check, or do you expect that to perhaps soften for some period of time?
Rick Wallace: I wouldn't say softened. I mean the challenge that customers have with EUV print check is into new application, there are new algorithms. There’s new defects that they've got to run down and do source. And so there's a huge appetite to get that. In fact, we're getting a lot of pressure to get systems that were forecast delivered to support that. And there are additional algorithms, as I said, we're developing. So all the indications we see are an expanding opportunity for EUV print check and I think that will go for some time based on the early indications that we're getting.
Operator: We'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: I wanted to dig into the gross margins and your operating margins, both were above your longer-term planned for September. And I believe the midpoint of your guidance says that they can sustain at these levels. I'm curious, how should we think about the trajectory of these margins going into the next several quarters? Can they sustain at these levels or do you think that there was anything abnormal, whether it was COVID or mix related that helped you? And as kind of part B of that, it was good to see you restart the share buybacks, but the levels are still somewhat below, I think what you have done in some prior quarter. So any color around just the sustainability of margins and how you can reaccelerate share repurchase would be very helpful. Thank you.
Bren Higgins: On gross margin, as I said earlier, we've been very pleased overall with the product positioning overall and the pricing related to that positioning. So that's been a good thing for our business. I mentioned operating leverage in Service. And so with the growth of the Service business, the utilization rates in the installed base that one thing with consolidation in the industry allows you to really drive good utilization across your resources. And we've invested in a lot of infrastructure over the last few years and we're starting to see the benefits of that now. We are getting the tailwind too in our EPC group related to acquisitions that the acquired businesses are doing better from a margin point of view. So there's a number of factors that are driving. If you look at our long term plan, we talked about 60% to 61% at these revenue level type gross margin performance. And I would expect us now to be somewhere between 61% and 62%. You do have mix factors in any given quarter. But I do think there's probably a good point here of sustainability versus the model that we had. If you take it down to operating margins, I think we're underspending our normalized spend levels just because of some of the COVID constraints around travel, but also how quickly we can hire people and so on. So I do think that the spend level is probably understated a bit when compare it to what normalized would look like. But I do think that there is a point here that drops through that has sustainability to it. Mix issues notwithstanding in any given quarter. On the buyback, as we back up and just look at it, we start with a principle in terms of how we look at the overall capital structure of the company and then how we allocate the capital. And so we start with a cash target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we're operating within our target range today. And so most of our buybacks or returns generally are funded through ongoing cash flow. So it was a little bit lower in this quarter compared to the March quarter, I guess. I can't recall exactly where that number was, I think March and December. But I think as you look at that and we look at our go-forward expectations around cash flow, we would expect it will be roughly around these levels on an ongoing basis. So somewhere, it was $188 million, I'd say somewhere around $200 million plus or minus. And it's a systematic approach because, again, it starts with sort of a process that we run through. So we have some opportunistic possibility around that, that we can work around it. But at the same time, it tends to be much more principle based than anything else. So I think that's how you'll see it play out. At the end of the day, we're going to return at least 70%. We returned 82% in the last 12 months. And we're going to return at least 70% of the cash flow we're going to generate through the share repurchases and dividends and pretty balanced across the two.

Blayne Curtis: I just want to revisit prior question on memory. You mentioned in your letter, customers were looking for higher big growth to meet demand. Just any more color where that demand is coming from? And I know you don't want to guide for memory next year, but just any color on what type of magnitude outside you're seeing?
Rick Wallace: Well, like I said, we're optimistic. We see some improvement in the December quarter, and I think that continues as we move into next year. So most of it coming from customers supporting 5G and handsets, we think that's probably the biggest driver. But it's pretty modest growth at these levels just given where the industry has been, but we're optimistic that we'll see growth as we move into next year.
Operator: And I'm showing that we have no further questions. At this time, I'll turn the call back to Kevin Kessel for any closing or additional remarks.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you very much, Priscilla, and thank you, everybody, for your questions and your interest. We will be talking to you shortly during the quarter during our virtual investor event. This concludes the call.
Operator: This concludes today's KLA first quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast. Please disconnect your line at this time, and have wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-08-03 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, and welcome to KLA’s fiscal Q4 2020 quarterly earnings call to discuss the results of our June quarter and the outlook for the September quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today’s call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2020 that we released today after the market close in the form of a press release, Shareholder Letter and slide deck. All these documents can be found on the IR section of our website. Today’s discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today’s earnings materials posted on the KLA IR website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy and links to KLA’s SEC filings, including the most recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosed in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. As we mentioned last quarter, we are changing the format of these calls to provide deeper insights into KLA and our business performance and also a lot more time for Q&A. beginning of this quarter, we will provide some highlights from our full prepared remarks, which can be found in the shareholders’ letter before beginning our Q&A session. I encourage you all to read the letter. It can be accessed on our KLA IR website. And with that, I’d like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. On behalf of all of us at KLA, we hope you and your families are safe and in good health, and we thank you for your continued interest and support of our company. In many ways, our performance in the June quarter, once again, highlights how the KLA operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a dependable framework to guide our execution and help us consistently deliver on our commitments. Thanks to the dedication, engagement and perseverance of our global workforce in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. KLA delivered strong results in the June 2020 quarter. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS each finished above the midpoint of our guidance ranges, demonstrating strong consistent demand from our customers, exceptional execution by our teams and the enduring strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model under today’s extraordinary circumstances. For my opening remarks today, I plan to touch on some of the key messages from our letter to shareholders. I’ll start with an update on our priorities related to COVID-19, touch on the industry demand environment, and then cover five highlights from the quarter before passing it to Bren, who will review our financial highlights and our outlook. In terms of COVID-19, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our partners. Our action to date have been successful and effective as reflected in our strong financial results in the first half of calendar 2020, but more importantly, in our safety record to this point in this pandemic. It’s also important is that our worldwide teams have never lost sight of what our customers need. Our teams have been exceptionally resourceful and committed to executing for our customers most pressing needs and challenges. Customer feedback has been outstanding. KLA is consistently delivering on our customer commitments. Investment in the long-term remains an important priority for us during this time. We’re confident that our R&D investments will help ensure a bright future. Now, turning to the industry demand environment. Customer demand is strong. We ended the quarter with our second highest level of quarterly backlog ever. In the June quarter, we saw broad diversified strength across each of our segments. Semiconductor process control was above plan, multiple EPC businesses set records and our services business achieved record installations. Today’s environment continues to accelerate many of the secular industry growth drivers that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. Data center demand, 5G infrastructure, the revival of PC demand to support work from home, virtual collaboration, remote learning and entertainment and gaming are driving an acceleration of the data era that translates across end markets and industries. We’re also seeing this acceleration in our own business, adopting new digital productivity tools to improve collaboration with teams and customers. We’ve also increased investment to accelerate digitalization of our global enterprises. For example, in our services business, we’re working closely with our customers to expand remote service technologies, to augment our in-country service and installations engineers. There are five highlights that stood out the most during the past quarter. First, we saw a continued strength in foundry and logic in the June quarter, and our revenue forecast for the remainder of 2020 shows relative balance between businesses from these customers. Business from memory customers is improving somewhat in the second half of 2020 versus the first half with higher business levels and more customer breadth expected in the December quarter with that momentum continuing into 2021. Second, KLA ended the June quarter with near record total company backlog demonstrating momentum in the marketplace across our portfolio. Newly launched products, such as the well-received eSL10, e-beam inspection platform helped drive our market leadership. Third, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and healthy free cash flow generation once again this calendar year. The services business set a record for system installations in the quarter. We see robust service contract penetration, which has risen steadily from the 70% plus contract penetration to 75% plus over the past several quarters and delivering a strong recurring revenue stream. We’re forecasting service revenue growth in 2020 in line with our long-term annual 9% to 11% target. Fourth, the newly formed Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group delivered record results in the June quarter and finished above our internal forecast. within EPC, we achieved the key milestone with the SPTS delivering recordly quarterly revenue of $100 million in the June quarter. We expect 2020 to be a year of double-digit growth for SPTS. PCB also had a record quarter, driven by improved market positioning, supporting 5G infrastructure and handsets. The strong results for EPC are coming about 18 months post the acquisition of Orbotech. We’re very pleased to see the successful demonstration of our strategic growth strategies bearing fruit. We’re also on pace to achieve cost synergies from the Orbotech acquisition above the original targets. Finally, in keeping with our commitment to deliver strong and predictable capital returns to our shareholders; today, we announced our board of directors has approved the eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase. The increase raises our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.90 per share for an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. KLA’s dividend payout has grown at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception. Before I hand it over to Bren, let me summarize by saying KLA is focused on innovation and execution combined with market leadership and robust free cash flow have helped us successfully navigate through these challenging times. We believe the secular factors driving industry demand in our 2023 targets remain firmly intact and will drive diversified growth the strong long-term operating leverage that positions our business to be even stronger and more resilient in the future. With that, I’ll turn it over to Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. KLA’s June quarter results highlight both the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership all while growing operating profits generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital return strategies. Total revenue was $1.46 billion. non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, slightly above the midpoint of the guided range of the quarter of 59% to 61%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.73 towards the high end of the guiding range of $1.81 to $2.87. GAAP EPS was $2.63. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment was modestly above expectations for the quarter. Foundry was once again strong at approximately 50% of semiconductor process control systems’ revenue. logic was about 10% of semiconductor systems revenue and memory customers were roughly flat at 40% in the June quarter. Within memory, the business was evenly split about 50/50 between DRAM and NAND. revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was a record $100 million, up 18% sequentially and 50% year-over-year is on track for double-digit growth in calendar 2020. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was also a record at $202 million, up 26% sequentially, and 10% year-over-year and above internal plans. In terms of balance sheet highlights, KLA ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash, total data, $3.5 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. From a cash flow and capital returns perspective, free cash flow was $411 million in the June quarter. free cash flow conversion was 96.5% and free cash flow margin was 28.2%. for capital returns over the past 12 months, we have returned $1.35 billion to shareholders or 83% of free cash flow, including $522 million in dividends paid and $829 million in share repurchases. We believe our track record of delivering strong capital returns is a key component of the KLA investment thesis, and offers predictable and compelling value creation for our shareholders. As Rick mentioned, a moment ago, our board approved our eleventh consecutive annual dividend increase, the results in an annual run rate dividend of $3.60 per share. as it relates to guidance for the September quarter, we’d like to start out by saying that our operations teams have done a great job of mitigating the supply chain challenges and disruptions related to COVID-19 although we are carrying more inventory to mitigate unanticipated disruptions, should they occur. the extra measures we have taken to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain have definitely been effective as demonstrated by KLA’s strong results for both our March and June quarters that either met or exceeded the midpoint of guidance ranges. with that said, we are narrowing our guidance range as we generally see consistency in the current operating environment. the demand profile today for the second half of the year is firming and we now anticipate that the second half will grow versus the first half of 2020. for the calendar year, we expect a faster than market growth year for semiconductor process control business and growth for the total company in line with or above our long-term revenue growth target range. With that, guidance for the September quarter is as follows: total revenue is expected to be $1.48 billion plus or minus $75 million. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in a range of 60.5% to 62.5% as product makes this more favorable versus the June quarter. the market reception to new product offerings in our semiconductor process control business has been strong and as outlined at our Investor Day back in September, the company has made solid progress in our plans of driving costs and efficiencies on new product platforms and leveraging scale derived by our worldwide service infrastructure. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $2.18 to $2.82 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $2.42 to $3.06. In closing, we have adapted to a challenging environment. We are executing well and have even more confidence that we’re on track to meet our 2023 target model, both in terms of top-line growth and profitability. We are encouraged by the strength and resiliency of the KLA operating model, which guides our strategic objectives. These objectives fuel our growth, operational excellence and differentiation across an increasingly more diverse product and service offering. We also underpin our sustained technology leadership, deep competitive mode and strong track record of free cash flow generation and capital returns to shareholders. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A.
Kevin Kessel: Charlie, please provide the instructions for the queuing and begin the Q&A.
Operator: Sure, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: good afternoon, solid job on the quarterly execution. Three months ago, the industry’s supply chain, as well as demand trends looked pretty uncertain. You fast forward to today, supply chain has come back semiconductor fundamentals while we can, June or as fully showing signs of improvement entering the second half of the year. If I look at your results and guide and make some assumptions on December, it looks like you will be towards the upper end of your pre-COVID-19 revenue outlook or sort of in that low-double digits percentage revenue goal for this calendar year first. is that a fair assumption and maybe some commentary on your WFE spending outlook today versus pre-COVID-19 earlier this year?
Bren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it’s Bren and I’ll go first here. So, I think your conclusions are generally correct. As we said in the prepared remarks, we see our view on the year to be generally at the – within our long-term target growth range of 7% to 9% or above. And so as we look at the year overall, I don’t think things have changed all that much. I mean, you’re right. There was a lot that had to be done back in March and June in terms of managing supply chain and supporting customers, but we’ve worked through all that and we’ve got some consistency now in our overall view. So in general, I would say that our views overall are virtually unchanged. on WFE, everybody counts it up a little bit differently, but I would – so I don’t want to put a point number out there, but I would say that somewhere in the mid-to-high single-digit type growth, 55 to – or mid-50s to high-50s, probably the right way to think about it.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for that. And you entered the June quarter, I remember what the view of strong specialty semiconductor trends, but maybe, more meta trends within some of your other EPC segments like PCB and display as these are more consumer and sort of auto focused – automotive focus segments for you guys and probably, more impacted by COVID-19. but you’ve got it delivered strong double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth in the PCB, display and component inspection business. So, what drove these solid trends and how are you thinking about this particular segment as you move through the second half of this year?
Rick Wallace: Yes. thanks, Harlan. We’re really pleased with their performance in EPC and I think you have to – when you think about the different divisions, we saw a strong continuing momentum in packaging, and that’s really the ICOS business. We’re also seeing SPTS, the specialty semi business had a very strong showing and we mentioned that set a record there for revenue. PCB was earlier in the year, looked like it was going to soften and it strengthened and driven a lot by 5g infrastructure build out and we feel really good about the execution in that team. display is still in a tough spot and that’s not one that really, we saw a lot of strength and we’re following through on the conversations we’ve had on display, where we’re working on the cost structure and being positioned for when the recovery happens there. But I think the other business is – the other thing that’s really notable is SPTs had a very strong quarter in spite of no automotive business. So that’s really upside as we go forward. I think it’s pretty fair to say automotive semiconductors have bottomed. And so we feel pretty good about – it’s pretty much all upside from here as the spending has probably been curtailed, but showed signs toward the end of next year – this year and then into 2021, we’ll see some resumption of investment as the electrification projects continue. So yes, we feel good about where we are with that and we are definitely getting traction, having those under one organization and engaging with customers at a high level.
Bren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it’s bren. The only other thing I’ll add to that is we go back to April, when we were thinking about the quarter, it was unclear what the handset environment would look like in the second half of the year. And so I think one of the encouraging signs that we did see to Rick’s point was the PCB business was really driven by 5G and the preparation for the handset introductions that are to come. So, that was a bit of a surprise for us or perhaps had someone known built into it just related to overall COVID. So, I drove the SPTS business as Rick said, but also drove incremental upside in PCB.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes. good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren, just on the gross margin guide into September, pretty good sequential growth. I’m wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit. Is this a larger percent coming from the semi process control or is it mixed within SPC? And I guess importantly, do you think that the June quarter and now growth into September is a trend that you can sustain going forward? Or is this kind of an anomaly quarter relative to mix?
Bren Higgins: Yes. Hey, John. So, I would say that, yes, I mean, quarter-to-quarter, we’re seeing sequential growth in semi PC. and so that’s having a positive effect on gross margins. And so I think that what we’re seeing there, I’m encouraged as I said in the shareholder letter, we talked a lot about driving cost and efficiency improvements in new platforms and customer section has been strong. So, we feel pretty good about the product portfolio we have and the margin position. So, let me just say that I have more confidence around our margin trajectory moving forward, although quarter-to-quarter, the mixed dynamic tends to be the biggest factor that drives our margin around this range. But certainly, as we look forward, we feel pretty confident that we should be able to maintain this sort of 61% and above type trajectory that that we’re experiencing right now.
John Pitzer: Helpful. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about second half of the calendar year growing over the first half, I’m kind of curious if you could break that down between sort of memory and logic/foundry, and how might that have changed over the last 90 days? I don’t want to words in your mouth, but it sounds like maybe, you’re less optimistic about a memory uptick in the back half of the year and perhaps more optimistic about logic/foundry sustaining, and if that’s the case in any read as we go into calendar year 2021.
Rick Wallace: Yes. We do see we see – we think there’s a lot of evidence that the foundry-logic is going to hold through the second half. And I think that also now, we’re getting indications of strength going into 2021. Part of the uncertainty, I think around the year that everybody has is the memory recovery probably towards the end of the calendar year. And that’s really where we would expect it to Q4 to strengthen there. So that’s I think maybe the less certain part of that, but the setup for logic looks really good. I think the progress that customers and designs, and the ongoing investment by our customers and in multiple design wins and multiple proliferation of devices and multiple players. So, we’re also getting breadth and our products are doing really well. So, we feel pretty strong about how the logic/foundry is going to hold up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and company. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one either Rick or Bren, clearly, like two of your largest logic and foundry customers have spoken about push out of either the 7-nanometer or potentially even the 3-nanometer on the foundry side. with the backdrop, how do you think of KLA’s process control revenue opportunity over the next year or two, given that some of the leading-edge nodes are getting pushed out and then I have a follow-up?
Rick Wallace: Yes. There’s really nothing that’s been discussed publicly that hadn’t been the way we’d been factoring and forecasting our business. So, it’s pretty much consistent with what we’ve seen. I think some of the public announcements are catching up with some of what was going on. you have to look at why there are delays; when there are delays and the delays tend to come from it’s much more an inability to execute than it is a demand. There’s plenty of demand at the leading edge. It’s the challenges associated with yield management with process control with the overall process integration and those are factors that we’re heavily involved in. So, we think that there’s a lot of continued momentum for us and process control both metrology and inspection on the leading nodes. And so that’s part of why our earlier comments in the last Q&A question, where about the strength that we see through the calendar year and then into 2021. So, we feel pretty good about how that’s going. And I think our in partnership with our customers; we’re helping them work through some of the most challenging metrology and effectivity issues. Some of which frankly, they did not anticipate, but we did and we’ve been showing some value and getting adoption as a result. Does that make sense?
Krish Sankar: Yes, yes. that does. thanks a lot, Rick. And then just to follow-up on the product side, you guys introduced pattern wafer e-beam inspection to look semicon. I’m just trying to figure it out, is your e-beam tool still focused on defect detection, or you feel looking at pattern facility of voltage contract, and your competent isn’t going to like multi-beam tools. You guys are still at single beam. So, you just want to figure out the e-beam roadmap. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Yes. So, what we wanted to make sure is that we could provide differentiated performance for – to address the market gaps that existed and that we could provide customers a complimentary solution along with our optical tools, because what they’re really trying to balance is how do they get all the characterization understanding and product development that they’re looking for out of a portfolio? So, we have some unique capabilities in our e-beam inspection tool. We think that the coverage it provides and the uniqueness, in addition to the fact that it’s closely coupled with our optical tools, it gives a very strong advantage to our customers by using them in parallel. And that’s what we’re seeing. We have mapped out and we have a lot of confidence that we understand what the roadmaps look like in terms of the different e-beam architectures and we feel very confident about our ability to be competitive in e-beam. We wouldn’t have reentered the market if we didn’t feel like we had a differentiated solution. And so that’s the ability both to find the defects of interest and to find them as throughputs that are compelling for our customers and we – as we map out the future, we don’t see any gap between us and competitors. In fact, we see that we have the ability to continue to differentiate our solution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. your line is now open.
CJ Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on your prepared comments, regarding memory and a greater breadth of spending into Q4 and then beyond into 2021. We’d love to hear kind of what you’re hearing in dialogue with customers there.
Bren Higgins: Yes, CJ. it’s bren. So I mean, judging by our percent of business for the September quarter’s memory. It’s lighter than in June. So, most of what we see in the second half, and this was one area, where it wasn’t all that clear if you back up three months ago and say, okay, we thought we’d see some memory recovery in the second half of the year wasn’t exactly sure when we’d see it. But as we’ve – so it looks like it’s more December focused. And it – I would say, it is probably heavier on the flash side, although there is fluidity in terms of how customers are thinking about investment plans, but I think you can look at all the players that are out there that we would expect to see business start to improve in that timeframe. And then I think there’s solid momentum as we move into next year. I don’t want to provide a color on 2021, but I think as we take a step back and look at where memory has been, I mean, starting in the middle of 2018, we’ve seen a pullback and very disciplined management of memory capacity and most of the investment focused on technology transition. So, as that market continues to recover, I think that the market’s in a pretty healthy place overall as we move into 2021.
CJ Muse: That’s helpful. As my follow-up for the PCB display and component business including service, how are you thinking about second half calendar year versus the first half? And then as part of that, how should we be thinking about seasonality in terms of peak quarter Q3 versus Q4 given how dominant PCB is within the construct there. Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes, SPTS, I would – it potentially could be flattish half to half. We’ll have to see how it plays out. I think PCB second half will be slightly – it will probably be lower in the second half, given what’s driven that the strength we saw in the June quarter, I would expect a lot of focus on execution as we move into the second half there. on the flat panel business, I wouldn’t expect much to change on that front. It is a 100% consumer focus. There’s virtually no LCD investment out there. And so there’s a fair amount of digestion of that capacity that’s still being worked through. So, I don’t expect any growth; in fact, maybe, second half might be flat to modestly down in that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Hi. thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Just maybe, following up CJ’s question about the memory span and timing, typically memory is a little bit more metrology biased versus say logic and foundry being a little more inspection biased. Is there any difference on the timing of your tool deliveries, because what I’m trying to get at is inspection tends to lead some of the process tools, but metrology may come in conjunction with process tools? So, am I looking at that correctly or are there still “lead time” in terms of metrology shipments relative to process tools?
Rick Wallace: that’s a good question. Certainly metrology, certain parts of metrology, like in film measurement and overlay tends to scale with capacity, but you also have on patterned inspection that scales also with capacity on the patterned inspection side, it tends to be a little bit more front-end in terms of just the development process itself. So now, I think from a lead time point of view, I don’t think the lead times on the products are all that much different a few months or so, but generally, that’s how it plays out.
Patrick Ho: Great. That’s helpful. And maybe, Bren as a follow-up, in terms of the opex management, you probably have gotten some savings over the last several months due to COVID-19 and the diminishing of travel and things of that nature, as we get back to a more normalized environment, how do you balance some of the increases that will come from that versus these attractive OpEx levels that you’re achieving today?
Bren Higgins: Yes, that’s a good question. And we’re probably operating right now, $10 million to $15 million below what I’d considered to be normalized run rates. We certainly wish we could add people faster, both in terms of new heads, but also a replacement head count. And so this process – this situation has slowed us down from that perspective. So, I think if you just look at overall spending levels today, relative to revenue or size in the company in that $380 million to $385 million range. I mean, ultimately, the way we’re going to run the company over the long-term is to drive a 1.5X drop through – 1.5X the revenue growth rate drop through to earnings. And so that implies 40% to 50% incremental operating margins. So, for every incremental dollar of revenue, we’re probably going to increase costs $0.10 to $0.15 or so. So that’s the way that if our incremental gross margins are above 60%. So, it’s a way to think about it. So, we’re going to look at the opportunities to invest. We always invest in our portfolio, that’s why our market share is almost 5X, our nearest competitors. Why we introduce products faster than our competitors is that we want to make sure we’ve got the best products out there and we continue to innovate. And so we’re going to look at the opportunities first and foremost and then size over time, consistent with our long-term model.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. So Bren, I guess that my first question is on the process control revenue. So, [Technical Difficulty] down in June, and I know that, there was maybe, some difficult comps, because of the Q4 last year. but WFE in the first half of this year is definitely up and your process control shipments have been down in March and June, and – but it sounds like you think that you’re going to at least keep up with the WFE for the year. So that would imply a pretty big back half of the year, given what’s happened here in the first half? Can you maybe, hold our hand a little bit and tell us why you seem to have lost like a little bit of share in the first half and maybe, why process control will be up so much and maybe, help us gauge how much will it be up in September? Are you talking 10% to 15% Q-on-Q? thanks. And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: So Tim, we don’t really look at WFE spent half-to-half years. I just look at overall expectations and the way we laid out the year at the beginning of the year, and we’re mostly in line with the plan that we had and against the backdrop of, let’s say WFE levels that are mid, single-digit growth for the year. I would expect our process control business to outperform the market. So, as I said earlier around since it’s such a big part of our business, that we would expect it to be within our target revenue range for the year is slightly above process control that statement’s consistent for a process control segment as well.
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I guess to sum up…
Bren Higgins: But half-to-half, I would expect it to be up. I would expect it to be up half-to-half.
Timothy Arcuri: And I guess just on that point, can you give us a sense for where you think it’ll be in September and then I guess my follow-up was, you didn’t really purchase any shares in the quarter, which is kind of interesting, why not. Thanks.
Bren Higgins: September, we guide the overall company and we manage and deploy resources across all of our businesses to meet our expectations. And so I don’t want to guide the semi PC business, but in terms of just overall expectations, I’d expect that business to grow mid single digits versus the June quarter. But that being said, if I’ve got strength in other parts of the company, and I may deploy resources in a different way that that helps us sort of manage to our overall numbers, but at the end of the day, what we’re really trying to do is drive to our expectations and to continue to ship and support customers according to their timing. But I would expect that mid single digit sort of quarter-to-quarter growth in that segment.
Operator: your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America Securities. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. I think, Rick or Bren, you mentioned some signs of foundry demand perhaps sustaining into next year. I was hoping if you could give us some more color, because I think consensus seems to be that foundry demand could actually – possibly decline next year. And I realize it’s early, but from what you see today, is it possible that foundry demand could actually be positive next year?
Rick Wallace: Yes, it’s really early for next year, but what we do see is, multiple customers making investments in foundry. And so far this year, it’s been largely a smaller group, so one. and so the expansion of that is really in the conversations we’ve been having and the commitment to that is what gives us the confidence for the second half of the year, and then the following projects that are coming after that, or why we think it’s a good setup for 2021. But obviously, there’s a long time between now and then. but I think the notion that there is success at these advanced nodes that you have the 5G infrastructure building out, you have a lot going on in the advanced computing and high performance computing along with the work toward AI is all very positive for what we’re seeing in terms of the continued investment in foundry and logic. And a lot of that is driven by the additional capability people are getting from the advanced nodes. So, that’s what gives us confidence that plus the conversations we’re having and the – our challenge in meeting some of the slot demands through the rest of the year, just to keep up with what customers are talking about needing, and we have pretty good ways of judging their actual intent. There are also a number of projects in China that are IoT RF sensor focused. And so it’s made foundry a higher percentage of the mix overall this year and we would expect some sustainability in that as we move into next year. So, to Rick’s point, there’s a fair amount of diversification, really across all end markets. we would expect automotive and industrial, and those areas that sort of fits back with the China statement or more trailing edge to be better next year and there’s enough in-market demand at the leading edge that’s driving incremental customer investment and mitigating reuse, and so on. So, I think the setup as we continue this year and the rest of the year, but also, has been moving to next year, it looks pretty good. Hey, there was a question earlier, Tim’s question on share repurchase. I just want to spend a second on it. So, we – as we started the quarter, we focused on overall liquidity and wanted to see how the market shaked out, given all the unknowns on COVID. So, as we progressed through the quarter, we did pause our share repurchase plan. We did buy back a fair amount of shares in the March quarter and we’d expect that we’ll start our capital allocation program. We’ll begin at this quarter again, at least around share repurchases and should finish the year in line with our objective of returning at least 70% of the cash flow we generate to shareholders. So, I would expect this year to be above that baseline.
Vivek Arya: And if I could ask a quick follow-up, there are two big trends going on. So, TSMC appears to be getting stronger. So, there are fewer, perhaps a high-end, leading edge customers to go after. And then there is also this trend of more sovereign manufacturing, but I understand it’s probably same demand, but maybe, scattered across a more places that could cause some cyclicality and I don’t know, how do you think KLA is positioned, when there are fewer leading edge foundry customers, and then if there is more sovereign manufacturing, does it shift more of the spending towards your competitors, who are exposed more to capacity rather than do technology ships or yield improvement? Just how do these two big trends play out for KLA over the next few years? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: I wouldn’t say there are fewer. So, I think if you look at leading edge investment and certainly, our expectations for what we’ve seen in this business, and what we expect going forward is to Rick’s earlier point, is no correlation between any of the announcements or conjecture that’s in the marketplace versus what we’re doing internally. So, we feel very good about the leading edge adoption that’s out there. And I think that as you see the end markets adopt, I think that that deploys more capacity. And with foundries – if foundries are providing more of that capacity, then that tends to be a higher process control intensity and as those customers have to deliver a lot of yielded product to type market windows. So, we feel pretty good about that. There’s a lot of end demand and there’s specific designs for those – for that demand. And so I think on the trailing edge side, there’s some start-up costs for new projects or maybe, inefficiency in the market. but over time, they’re building to specific markets and you might see some trading of capacity there. But overall, I think we feel pretty good about the leading edge environment, particularly end demand, but also the technology scaling that’s now happening with EUV.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you’ve talked about opportunities for higher metrology intensity at NAND flash at higher layer counts. So, I’m just curious, as we go into this next memory spending cycle, relative to the half cycle, how do we – how should we think about just your opportunity there for kind of the peak cycle revenues relative to the last cycle?
Rick Wallace: Yes. I’ll take the first part and then Bren can fill in the number, thinking that industry, Joe, I mean, what we’ve seen in two things; one as the design rules have or the design complexity has pushed both in flash and of course, in DRAM, that does create more opportunity. In some cases, the opportunity was already there. What was missing from us was necessarily a solution. So, a part of it was having the capability and tools to support the advanced node and the needs, and that’s something that we’re pretty happy with in terms of, as we laid out in the past, our ability to drive up process control, intensity, and memory, and we’ve already seen the first part of that. So, we feel validated in that approach. The other thing that’s interesting and we didn’t necessarily know is going to happen, but on DRAM, the introduction of EUV for DRAM driving more defectivity needs and capability, and the usage of that. So, there are some really positive trends in terms of driving process control intensity well above what it was in the past for memory. We really went backwards when the first move to NAND was first introduced, because they went back a couple of design rules, and now they’re back moving forward, we have some product capability. We’ve learned how to solve some of these problems and we’re engaged closely with customers. So, we feel good about the progression of process control intensity as the design rules continue to move forward with the technology nodes continue. It’s not just design rules as you know, but the challenges in the increased number of layers. So, Bren from a standpoint of the numbers.
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think we’ve seen process control share of WFE increased two to three points from the transition from planar NAND to vertical NAND. To Rick’s point, we do have some new products in the pipeline that if these products are effective and can be deployed in multiple units across fabs, give us an opportunity to improve that intensity, even higher, both in terms of metrology with some x-ray capability that we’re working on, but also if we can help solve the deep activity challenge, and defects within the stack and locating defects within the depth dimension of the stack. So, there is no shortage of opportunities, and I think we’ve seen it improve so far and we look to see a little bit of improvement moving forward. On the DRAM side, with the introduction of EUV, there is infrastructure for UV, whether it’s one layer or more, you still have to have a radical inspector to be able to qualify radicals, you have to qualify blanks. And then of course, you have to do print check to validate radical fidelity in the fab itself. So, there’s also infrastructure investment that needs to happen to support EUV in the DRAM side.
Joe Quatrochi: Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to clarify in your prepared remarks; you talked about the new U.S. restrictions. Is there a change in that at all, relative to what you’ve talked about last quarter, in terms of, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about difficult to predict the near-term dynamics relate to those?
Rick Wallace: Well, and it was – and we had to go through the exercising, the exercise as did our peer companies, of determining whether or not we were, how to be compliant with the regulations. And I think, all the peer companies have gone through that exercise and we’ve been able to navigate that. As we said, we’re going to obviously follow the law. It was just – there was some uncertainty as to what exactly how to interpret it. So, we’ve had the benefit of working through those details and feel like we’ve moved on from that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Joe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your business in China, it’s been pretty stable as a percentage of revenues. How is that mix shifting between multinationals and China sovereign kind of customers? And what are you seeing specifically from China sovereign customers?
Rick Wallace: We’re seeing growth this year. And so you’ve got the pieces that are part of PCB and display. So, my growth statement is more WFE-centric. But I would expect it to be 20% or more. So, I think WFE levels in China, for the native China customers are – is probably somewhere in the $9 billion to $10 billion range. So, it certainly is growth this year and it’s more foundry, and I would call it infrastructure centric.
Joe Moore: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and good job on the results and guide. Good to see EPC delivering records in the June quarter. I have a question on 5G, your 5G smartphone exposure on the PCB side gives you an edge over your peers, have based on our work and perhaps the higher stock multiple, how much of the PCB system and services revenues are 5G exposed on an annual basis?
Rick Wallace: So, when we’re looking at it right now, it’s about 50%, and it feels like the success that we’ve had there, as you point out, we’ve got good exposure, we’ve got good products to serve those customers. And we feel like that’s, this is early days where the 5G build-out. So, we think there’s continued opportunity there as we go forward.
Atif Malik: Great. And then Rick, there was a question earlier on delay at the U.S. logic maker. longer-term, I see you have better exposure to foundry versus that logic maker based on your 10-K, is that shipped up capacity from the U.S. logic maker to Taiwan foundry, potentially neutral for your logic opportunity or a modest positive?
Rick Wallace: It’s really hard to say. I mean, I think part of what we’ve experienced over time is that there are customers that historically, we’ve seen a high correlation between their ability to stay on leading edge and their engagement and investment in KLA process control equipment. So, what we’re seeing now is, people that feel like they’re needing to catch up are investing more to do that. But I think it’s pretty clear, if you want to stay on the leading edge of a lot of logic and foundry, and you don’t have the ability to fully understand and the learning cycles in the fab, you’re going to struggle. So anybody, that’s trying to get into a lead or maintain a lead ends up changing their investment profile. That’s why – what’s really good for us as people that want to do advanced node technology, because they need to invest. And so I would say that if it moves it’s because that they’ve struggled, and if they want to be successful, then they end up investing more. So, I think that what’s really good for KLA’s advanced nodes and the desire people have to support them. I think in – as you know, in a foundry, especially, a multiproduct foundry, the other challenge they have is their multiple process flows. So, it also is a challenge for inspection and metrology to be able to support so many flows, because all the designs aren’t all going through the same process flow. So, we generally feel really excited when we see the large number of increasing designs that advanced nodes that’s what’s really been encouraging. The other thing on the sustainability of it just – the one thing we would have wondered earlier this year was if we were to see utilization in the fabs of logic and foundry go down and we haven’t. So, we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the investments across the board.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Blayne Curtis: Hey guys, thanks for taking our question and nice results. Just curious on the service side, you had delays getting in and actually doing service, you talked about record number. I’m just kind of curious; sort of you mentioned earlier whether you actually are caught up or plan to catch up as you look into September?
Bren Higgins: Well, we installed a record number of tools in the June quarter. and so we feel very good about that on the circumstances and being able to transition to more localized teams to handle the installation requirements for our tools. And of course, our guidance for the September quarter contemplates those plans. Overall, service has been – has done extremely well. And Rick talked about utilization rates at foundry and logic. We’ve also seen very strong utilization rates and memory, which is another indicator of health of the market. So, we feel pretty good about all of that. We think we’re going to grow our long-term growth rate expectation – annual growth rate expectation per service is 9% to 11% and we think we’ll be in our target range and because of the scale that we’re now able to drive and some of the investments we made over the years, in China, in particular, but also in Taiwan and Korea. and so on we’re able to drive more economies of scale in our profit structure as well. So that’s – it’s a pretty good situation right now for service and I think we’ve adapted pretty well. And we’re trying to leverage some of the remote capability tools that that are out there today, for us to position this business from an efficiency and support point of view even better going forward.
Rick Wallace: Yes. I’ll just add to that. I mean, our service guys are really heroes, service guys and girls, this last quarter and this year, they’ve done an amazing job. When we look at all our customers, even back in Wuhan during the early stages of this crisis, the only people that we’re going anywhere inside of fabs were our service guys, and they were there to support our customers. And so often with our customers, when they don’t want to have visitors of any kind, that the exception is service, because they want to keep these fabs up and running. So really, it’s been remarkable to see the resiliency of that. And as Bren said, the long-term trend looks good and this year, we feel really good about services ability to hit the targets we’d set out pre-COVID for them. So, we feel really good about that.
Blayne Curtis: Thanks. I just want to ask on the recovery you’re targeting in memory, just kind of curious on the DRAM side; it was always going be late year. I was just curious if that’s part of any of the recovery you’re targeting?
Rick Wallace: I think DRAMs a little bit, I think flash is better in the – as I said earlier, I think flash is better in the second half of the year, and that DRAM is probably stronger than the first half of the year overall. But I mean, again, that can move around a little bit, but that’s how we see it right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Co. Your line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Just wanted to come back to the China business, obviously, you haven’t seen a major impact from the commerce department actions. But wondering if you’ve seen any increased threat of de-Americanization of equipment in China, especially, from the domestic suppliers and probably more on the metrology side than the inspection side of your business, where I think you guys are pretty well entrenched?
Rick Wallace: So Quinn, this is Rick, I think since KLA started doing business internationally, when I’ve been in the company back in Japan and whatever, the late 80s, there have always been attempts by our customers in different regions to have supply base. So, there’s never been a lack of interest and motivation that happened in Japan, of course, that happened in Korea, not quite as much in Taiwan, but definitely, happened in China. So for sure there is interest and desire to have their own capability. But, like as you know, this business, that’s – the impetus on us is to keep driving performance capability and making sure we’re competitive, so that we’re more than competitive, we’re compelling, so that we win that business. But yes, of course, there is interest in trying to have alternatives other than U.S. But I think the practical business of running semiconductors is you got to be competitive on a worldwide basis. And so you’ve got to have the capabilities to compete worldwide. And that’s always been, our belief is we have to win overall, because any opportunity, any region has to go with another solution they’re going to do it. So, we don’t see that as particularly different than it’s been in the past.
Quinn Bolton: Thanks. And then quick follow-up for Bren, just a nice gross margin guidance in September. I’m wondering if there are any lingering COVID-19 costs that are still affecting that the gross margin possibly in the freight and logistics shipping would be one area.
Bren Higgins: Yes. I don’t think it will – there are. And I don’t think it’ll change in the September quarter and probably, not in the December quarter. So there is a bit of a headwind there about 40 basis points the last quarter. And so the revenue is up a little bit, so a similar impact. Well, this quarter artifacted in the margin guidance. So yes, I think as we start to normalize, whenever that might be, we’ll start to – we’ll get a tailwind from increasing competition in the freight market overall but yes, inbound freight is costs have gone up there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thanks. You talk about the setup is pretty good for next year for foundry and logic. Is it mostly driven by the five-nanometer ramble? Are you expecting any contribution from three-nanometer development? I know it’s still early, but maybe broadly speaking, do you have a view when you’re going to start seeing the revenue relate to three nanometers?
Rick Wallace: Yes, both. For sure, we’ll see. I mean, as you know, these things go in cycles of the early – the early work and then you get the build-out and we also have some of the – as Bren mentioned earlier, we have a fair amount of logic that’s a trailing that continues to be the investment. But on the leading edge, sure, we’ll see early and already in those conversations about that early capability. And that will be of course, our leading edge tools, not as many early on, but that’s really in the debugging phase of that. And I would expect to follow on there. I would expect the broader levels of investment into the first half of next year. The breadth that we talked about this year, we would expect some continuation of that into next year. So, a lot of compelling opportunities for a number of players and in the foundry/logic space.
Sidney Ho: Great. Then maybe, my follow-up to – a follow-up question. Historically, you see process control strength early in the process, and then at phase once the products are in volume production. Do you expect this pattern to continue or do you see more sustainable strength through tech transitions going forward, given what you talked about earlier about the dynamics happening in the memory market?
Rick Wallace: It really – it is true. I mean, that trend is true. It’s especially true when there’s fewer – there’s less innovation. I think the difference now on the leading edge is what EUV has done is brought back scaling. And so that was really more pronounced in a period, where we have that long gap where there was no EUV, there was not another lithography technology for several years. And so that really exacerbated that trend. So, the two other factors now you’ve got additional designs, which is kind of a surprise from where maybe, the world was a while ago, and then you have multiple players trying to – so the phase of that is different, where you have different players trying to cut in, and since there’s a leader and then the other folks are behind, that gives another way of at a different location. So, I think the net of all that is it tends to be more sustainable, plus we have more products that are more tied to production. An example would be overlay, which is much more correlated to production and the number of layers that get measured and overlay, doesn’t really decrease that much now, given the challenges. So, you don’t have that same reduced sampling and reduced the number of tools and in some of these product areas as we might have had in the past.
Kevin Kessel: Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
Operator: Yes, sir. We have a question for Weston Twigg with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Weston Twigg: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just – there was something you said earlier that really resonated with me for KLA, which – it’s a more [indiscernible], which intuitively makes sense for the foundry side. You see more chips, more AI, special there’s 5G chips, chips going into different things that are all sort of custom. Can you help us think about how that provides uplift for clack overall over the next few years?
Rick Wallace: Yes, sure. I mean, think about the worst-case scenario for us is there’s one device made by one person, right? And they dial that process in and they lock it in for three years and they don’t change anything, right? That would be the worst case, because as you know, what they really want to do is dial on the process, get everything under control and have it be just grump and then not pay any attention and let the thing run, have all the CPKs in line. So, the other end of that continuum is lots of process designs. What’s interesting about foundry is they don’t force one process. In fact, part of their selling proposition is you have multiple process flows through a foundry. So, if you look and you can publicly go do this and look at TSMC, you can pick tons of different process flows, which that means is the large number of change. The other thing that we’ve seen in the reverse trend in the last few years, as you have hyperscalers, data center people designing their own chips, because they want to have an advantage in their own design. So, we have a lot of customers. We have our customers – customer traditionally is far greater than it used to be, which is why there’s so many designs happening at advanced nodes. When the view was at some point that it was going to keep restricting the number of designs that’s not what’s happened. So that creates more and more flow of process and change, and the need to manage that is all upside. So, we’re really excited when we started seeing the number of relevant designs become more and more successful, because that that’s a factor that favor is process control in order for people to be so successful at producing those. Does that make sense?
Kevin Kessel: Okay, Charlie.
Operator: Yes, sir. We have no further question at this time, I will now turn the call back to the presenters.
Rick Wallace: Okay. We wanted to thank everybody for their time and interest. And this concludes the call and Charlie, please provide the final instructions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-05-05 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standby. And welcome to the KLA Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations with KLA Corporation. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Charlie. And welcome to KLA's earnings conference call to discuss the results of the March 2020 quarter and the outlook for the June quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2020, that we released today after the market close and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.
 Today's discussion and our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA IR website, along with our newly published shareholder letter.
 Our IR website also contains a calendar of future virtual investor events and presentations, corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.
 Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are also subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
 I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. 
Richard Wallace: Thank you all for joining us today in these extraordinary times. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy.
 KLA delivered strong results in the March 2020 quarter. Revenue finished at the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint of the guidance range, demonstrating strong demand from our customers and exceptional execution across our global KLA operations. KLA's performance in the March quarter highlights how the company's operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a strong and resilient framework to guide our execution and consistently deliver on our commitments even during unprecedented challenges.
 In our prepared remarks today, we will discuss how KLA's unique and sustainable competitive advantages helped us consistently deliver strong relative results, while showcasing the enduring strength of the KLA investment thesis. We will also discuss how KLA is positioned to confidently navigate through these periods of uncertainty.
 To lead off, I want to highlight KLA's priorities and actions in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Please turn to Slide 4. First and foremost, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, their families and our partners. We began taking proactive measures for our teams as soon as we saw the outbreak begin in China, including immediately eliminating nonessential travel, canceling our annual sales conference, our global engineering conference as well as the KLA Lithography Users Forum at SPIE.
 A large percentage of our workforce is in China and the Pacific region, and we initiated a global crisis management team to ensure we had insight into needs and activities at the local levels to provide assistance as needed. As information and shelter-in-place orders began to roll out across the globe, we prioritized rapid communications to our employees. And we immediately instituted guidelines and policies to ensure that our essential workforce could operate in safe conditions, and we remain focused on that daily.
 Specifically, as our teams worldwide have largely had to shift to working from home, we worked hard to maintain our ability to support our customers in this unique scenario. At our manufacturing facilities, we have focused on creating a significantly reduced employee footprint. We have rigorous social distancing and cleaning guidelines and health checks to allow our teams to be safe while staying on track with shipping, installing and delivering the essential services we provide to our customers.
 I'd like to personally commend our global team for their resourcefulness and commitment to executing under these challenging circumstances. Our customer feedback has been outstanding. And our business is healthy and performing well under unprecedented conditions. I'm really proud of the way we as a company have responded to these challenges. It really reflects the extraordinary strength of our teams guided by the KLA core values of perseverance, drive to be better, high-performing teams and indispensability.
 For our global employee base, we recognize that this crisis also extends well beyond the disruption to their work life. And we're focusing on continuing to ensure that we can support them in any way that we can.
 I'd also like to note that we took action to support our communities by creating a KLA Foundation Global Relief Fund, where we committed $2 million in global relief efforts to benefit local nonprofit organizations, which are working in areas identified as having a high number of affected individuals and with those who are with high-risk populations in Asia, Europe, Israel and the United States. Above all, we remain advocates for the holistic health and safety of our employees as well as the communities they work and live in.
 Turn now to Slide 5 for some comments on the industry demand environment. Though we were encouraged to see many of our customers in China return to full production late in the quarter, COVID-19 has already impacted global economic growth. The question remains whether it will result in a short-term pushout in global demand supported by substantial levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus from governments or whether it leads to long-term demand decline followed by an elongated recovery. Many economic prognosticators now expect a global recession as the effects of business disruption, rising unemployment and reduction in consumer spending are felt across the global economy.
 So at KLA, we're not predicting the depth or duration of this impact until we have more evidence about the evolution of the crisis. But if there's one thing we do know, it's the situation is rapidly evolving. And at this stage, the full impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand and the global economy remains unclear. But from our point of view, although the semiconductor equipment industry is currently supply-constrained, customer demand remains strong in the first half of 2020. And to underscore that point, KLA delivered record shipments of our semiconductor process control systems during the quarter, and total backlog finished at record levels exiting March.
 It's also important to point out that KLA is most levered to our customers' strategic R&D investments and their product road maps for leading-edge technologies across foundry, logic and memory. Our customers use these investments as critical to their long-term growth strategies and their competitive positioning. And therefore, they tend to be more resilient.
 Now in the near and medium term, we see increased semiconductor device demands for enterprise and cloud applications in response to the surge in work from home and a pickup in gaming. Now this is somewhat offset by a decline in some consumer-facing end markets. We also see strong results in our specialty semiconductor markets with demand driven by 5G infrastructure investment, particularly in China. We're fulfilling urgent requests to supply products essential in MEMS manufacturing and power technologies focused on medical applications such as smart thermometers and ventilators, which are directly addressing the crisis.
 It's clear health care will be one of the many industries which will be profoundly impacted with the acceleration of technology implementation, virtual capabilities and automation. We know that KLA is not immune to the impact this crisis may have on customers' capital investment plans over the next several months. However, we do draw some confidence from the historical evidence that our customers tend to maintain their investment in next-generation development in times of semiconductor industry contraction and uncertainty, which makes KLA's revenue more resilient in times like this.
 As an example, I'd point out that in 2019, according to the recent Gartner market share analysis, total WFE investment was estimated to decline about 6%, but KLA semiconductor process control business grew at 1%. Taking a step back even further, it's worth highlighting that KLA's business has always declined less than the industry in periods of general contraction.
 Also, KLA's service business, which accounts for roughly 1/4 of our total revenues today and has strong and growing profitability, also tends to demonstrate exceptional resilience throughout the business cycle, given the unique nature of our service model with 70% to 75% of the revenue being subscription-like contracts.
 Given the continued focus on innovation and execution, combined with our market leadership and strong balance sheet, KLA is in a very strong position to navigate this period of uncertainty and to capitalize on opportunities to drive long-term growth for our industry once the conditions eventually normalize. Even though we couldn't have anticipated what we're experiencing today, we believe that secular factors driving the industry demand and our 2023 revenue and EPS targets remain largely intact, and they'll drive diversified growth with operating leverage over the long term.
 Finally, in many ways, the global response to COVID-19 is accelerating secular drivers of the industry growth that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day. And that gives us strong optimism that we and our industry will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. We always knew we had compelling secular growth trends a year ago, but if anything, these trends will be stronger and more important going forward. Whether it's the move to Industry 4.0 or factory automation, the rising semiconductor content in automobiles, remote medical diagnostics and care, 5G, ubiquitous connectivity supported by continued data center build-outs or new, more capable handset offerings, the new work-from-home reality or the overall acceleration of digitization and move to the data era, everything will depend on advancing semiconductor technology that KLA helps to make possible.
 Please turn to Slide 6 and 7 for a review of the KLA operating model and our strategic objectives. As in prior industry downturns, one thing that remains a constant, serving as our guide as we manage through this uncertainty, is the KLA operating model. This codifies our corporate values and management principles and defines the critical core competencies that drive our performance and represents a solid and enduring framework for the execution of our long-term strategic objectives. The KLA operating model is essential to aligning the company on a consistent strategy. It ties accountability to results, ensures product development execution and facilitates continuous improvement, while ensuring the company always operates with strong financial discipline while driving long-term performance and profitability objectives.
 As we indicated during our September 2019 Investor Day, we're also leveraging the KLA operating model to strengthen the performance of new businesses. We have recently reorganized the former Orbotech units under the leadership of long-term KLA Executive Vice President Oreste Donzella, creating the new Electronics, Packaging and Components or EPC group. This new organization will help drive synergies and growth across the broad electronics value chain, including specialty semiconductors, packaging, printed circuit boards and flat panel display.
 Guided by this and with our global team's experience navigating through various industry cycles and downturns over the years, we have the benefit of history and the processes in place to maintain a high level of investment, which is critical to our market leadership and our customers' technology road map, while at the same time, protecting and preserving operating margins.
 Please turn to Slide 8 for the March quarter 2020 business highlights. In closing, I'd like to mention 4 highlights that stood out this quarter. First, as I mentioned at the outset, KLA achieved record company-wide shipments driven by record shipments in our Semiconductor Process Control segment, and we ended March with record backlog. This illustrates the overall momentum we are having in the marketplace across various product platforms with particular strength in mask inspection, patterned optical inspection and films metrology. And it further shores up our confidence in the long-term future growth position for the company.
 Secondly, we're really pleased to see KLA's customer success being further validated by third-party market share analysis from Gartner. KLA's market leadership is the result of ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiated products and a portfolio of products and solutions that address the most critical process control market challenges. And we're pleased once again to see the success of our strategy being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions.
 The report shows that process control grew as a percent of overall WFE, and KLA strengthened its process control market leadership by gaining 2.5 points of market share. The past year marked a record or new record demand in KLA's core franchises such as optical wafer inspection, overlay metrology and mask inspection. This data also shows KLA's first meaningful revenue in e-beam inspection since 2015. We expect the process control intensity will continue to stay at a similar level in calendar 2020 or better and that KLA will maintain our market leadership, driven by an expanding EUV investment environment as well as advanced technology development in memory and continued semiconductor industry expansion in China.
 Third, we saw continued strength in both foundry and logic. Foundry and logic revenue grew sequentially as customers accelerated the ramp of both 7- and 5-nanometer nodes and continue to prioritize their leading-edge technology road maps.
 And finally, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and steady free cash flow in calendar 2020 despite all the uncertainty. Total KLA service revenue rose to $373 million, thanks to the continued growth of our Semiconductor Process Control installed base as well as the expanding service businesses from recent acquisitions.
 Please turn to Slide 9 for my concluding thoughts. To summarize, before I turn the call over to Bren, we're in extraordinary times. And in that, we're facing both unprecedented uncertainties as well as opportunities. But amidst this background, one thing that's not changing is KLA's strong fundamentals. And we're confident that our strategies and the actions we're taking today will continue to lead us in the right direction and position us to emerge even stronger and more resilient.
 KLA's March quarter indicates the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We expect to be able to continue to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership while protecting operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our capital return strategies. As I stated earlier, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to preserve the health and safety of our employees and their families. We believe that this is a new reality, and we're going to be in this for some time, but we're confident we can work together to get through it and continue to deliver in the way we know how.
 I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bren, to discuss our financial results and guidance. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 11 for quarterly financial highlights. KLA delivered a solid quarter in March with revenue at the midpoint and non-GAAP EPS finishing at the upper end of the company's guidance ranges. 
 Total revenue was $1.424 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%, at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 59.5% to 61.5%, driven by a richer product mix than was modeled at the beginning of the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.47. At the guided tax planning rate of 13%, EPS would have been $2.52. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS includes an impairment of goodwill of $257 million and a $22.5 million loss related to the extinguishment of our November '21 notes that we refinanced in a new bond offering in February.
 Let me briefly provide more context on the goodwill impairment. During the March quarter, and consistent with our policy, KLA conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment based on the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. Given the uncertainty of the current environment and the associated unknown long-run trajectory of economic growth, we recorded a noncash impairment charge of $257 million in the third quarter to write down a portion of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Orbotech acquisition.
 Before going into further detail on quarterly results, I want to echo Rick's comments and say that while the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and presents new challenges to running our business, one thing remains clear. KLA has a resilient business model underpinned by a rock-solid investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis.
 Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, and our recent bond offering and refinancing means that we are in a great position and don't have any bond maturities until late 2024. To further expand on that point, I want to highlight that in February, KLA issued $750 million and 3.3% 30-year bonds to redeem $500 million in aggregate principal amount 4.125% senior notes due in November of 2021. And S&P upgraded our credit rating one notch earlier in the quarter to BBB+.
 Given our solid balance sheet and consistently robust free cash flow that our business generates, we believe KLA has enough cash and liquidity to respond to any operating condition, while still being able to execute our long-term strategies, invest at a high level in new capabilities across our product portfolio and maintain our well-articulated capital returns approach, which includes our current $3.40 annual per share dividend.
 Regarding capital management and deployment, as you would expect, we are reviewing all operating expenses and capital expenditure plans to prioritize and optimize them given the current business conditions and economic environment. One thing is certain. We remain committed to returning 70% or more free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, balanced between dividend payments and share repurchases.
 In March, we were consistent with our long-standing capital return framework, returning 113% of quarterly free cash flow to investors, consisting of $133 million in quarterly dividend distributions and $316 million in repurchases of common stock. KLA currently has approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.
 Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 for the breakdown of revenue by segments, end markets, products and regions. Revenue for the Semiconductor Process Control segment, which includes associated service business, was healthy at $1.18 billion. Foundry was once again very strong in March at approximately 55% of Semi Process Control revenue, up from 52% last quarter. Memory was 31% in March, down from 40%. Logic was 14% versus 8% last quarter.
 Revenue for the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment was $85 million, up 13% sequentially, driven by strength in RF, MEMS and advanced packaging. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was $160 million, down 14% sequentially and slightly below our internal plans as these businesses, which are closer to consumer markets, softened somewhat as we moved through the quarter.
 Now for the breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, starting with the distribution of revenue by major product category. Wafer inspection was 38%. Patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 21%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the Semiconductor Process Control segment. Specialty Semiconductor Process was 5%. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 7%. Service was 26% of revenue in the quarter and other was 3%.
 The regional split of revenue was as follows: China was 25%. Taiwan was 24%. Korea was 21%. The U.S. and Japan were 11% each. Europe, including Israel, was 5%. And the rest of Asia was 3%.
 Please turn to Slide 14 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $378 million, including $215 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were modestly below our targets for the quarter, with the largest delta to plan coming from lower travel and entertainment expenses and a slower hiring pace than was originally planned. Operating margin was 34.6%. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $38 million.
 The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% and above the company's long-term tax planning rate of 13% due to negative capital market impact on expense deductions in the company's employee deferred compensation program. Going forward, based on the company's expectations for geographic distribution of profit, you should continue to use 13% as a long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $389 million, and the company had approximately 157 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
 Turning now to a review of our balance sheet and free cash flow on Slides 15 and 16. KLA ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion.
 Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong, coming in at $442 million and $399 million, respectively. Free cash flow margin was 28%, and the annualized free cash flow yield was above 6%. For a frame of reference, over the last 10 years, KLA's free cash flow margin averaged 25%. KLA's business model generates strong free cash flow and is very resilient across the various phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the past 5 years, the company has averaged 98% free cash flow conversion.
 Please turn to Slide 17 for a snapshot of our capital return activities. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchase shares being roughly $73, with approximately $4.1 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010.
 Now for our June 2020 guidance on Slide 18. I will start by saying we have mitigated the supply chain issues related to COVID-19 that arose over the past quarter, but fluidity related to this situation makes it a daily challenge to manage as countries around the world handle their respective coronavirus responses. The uncertainties and added complexity associated with global social distancing policies, such as travel restrictions and mandated quarantine periods, continue to pose challenges to our ability to install and support KLA systems.
 Accordingly, we have taken extra measures to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain. Somewhat unique to KLA's business model are longer material lead times and volume hedging strategies that -- to enable flexibility with key components in our products, which slows inventory velocity but allows us to weather short-term disruptions in supply. For short lead time parts, we maintain dual supplier strategies, mostly with suppliers in different countries to optimize capital commitments and ensure we can shift supply to maintain flexibility to meet fluid customer delivery schedules.
 In addition, our customers rely on KLA to enable their long-term technology development programs, which tend to be sustained and protected in periods of short-term demand uncertainty and disruption, such as we are currently experiencing. We continue to maintain close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply chain pressure points, and we remain confident today in our ability to meet our demand and to be able to continue to service and support our customers in the field.
 KLA is managing this situation with both determination and creativity. We have fully mobilized our teams and are taking action to minimize disruption in our operations, meet essential customer needs and maintain the resilience of our supply chain to limit the overall impact of COVID-19 across our business.
 Given the scale of our worldwide service and support infrastructure, we are supporting our customers with local resources and are executing well. However, it is taking longer in some cases to complete rigorous acceptance criteria for certain products without the support of our factory-centric teams. In all cases, we've done our best to contemplate these factors in our guidance, including the broader range of guidance in our June quarter outlook, which is as follows. Total revenue for the June quarter is expected to be in a range of $1.26 billion to $1.54 billion. Foundry is forecasted to be about 51% of Semi Process Control system revenue, depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. Memory is expected to be approximately 39%. Logic is expected to be about 10% of Semiconductor Process Control system revenue.
 We forecast gross margin to be in a range of 59% to 61% as product mix is modestly less favorable and slightly higher costs are expected in our service business than in the March quarter. Other model assumptions include operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13%.
 Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.58 to $2.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.87. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 156 million shares.
 For my financial conclusion, please turn to Slide 19. I'd like to share our perspective on the demand environment for the balance of the year 2020. First, I'd like to address the new export rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, which will go into effect on June 29, 2020. Those rules will expand export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that have operations that could support military end uses even if the item sold by the U.S. companies are used for civilian purposes only.
 On this issue, I would note that the new rules do not impact the majority of our business as most of our products are manufactured and assembled outside of the United States. I would also like to point out that we routinely ensure that our products are not used for prohibited military end uses in China. However, the question remains today whether these new rules, when enacted, would make it more difficult to ship to certain customers in China that might be deemed military end users under the new rules as a result of their potential activities supporting military end uses.
 We are still assessing the new rules and working with trade associations and others to obtain additional guidance from the U.S. government regarding the scope and practical application of these new rules. Once we have clarity on how these rules will be implemented, we can better determine the impact on our business, if any, in the second half of the calendar year.
 Notwithstanding this recent trade issue, our outlook for customer demand in the Semiconductor Process Control business is virtually unchanged today from what we expected in February. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our supply chain in our factories to meet current customer expectations for deliveries. However, we do expect that the overall macroeconomic environment will put pressure at some point on some of our customers' demand for products in certain segments and ultimately could affect their capacity investment plans, both in magnitude and timing.
 Obviously, the depth and duration of this impact is unknown today, so we will continue to run our business to maintain the flexibility to respond to any demand scenario. We do expect our customers to continue to progress their technology road maps across all segments, and KLA products are critical to those transitions. We expect investments to continue in this area at a normalized pace, independent of the macro environment.
 For our more consumer-centric businesses, we have seen some weakness over the course of the March quarter. And while we are well positioned, we would expect some impact to these businesses compared to what we thought in early February.
 Finally, collaboration across global teams and partners on large-scale product development programs without direct in-person engagement is creating some execution challenges, and while early, could put pressure on release dates for new products expected over the next 12 months.
 To summarize, as we look ahead to the balance of the year, KLA continues to be well positioned to navigate the uncharted territory we find ourselves in. We derive our strength from our strong balance sheet and liquidity and comfort from not having any bond maturities until late in 2024. Our strong operating performance helps us prioritize critical investments across our technology portfolio and protects our margins while simultaneously generating strong and consistent free cash flow.
 Our market position has never been stronger. Despite the usual competitive noise, our share gain and improving process control intensity serve as validation that our products -- our portfolio of products and solutions are adding critical value to our customers' technology road map differentiation and their ability to yield these new technologies at production volumes.
 How we allocate capital has never been more important. You can be assured, we will continue to make smart capital allocation decisions, continue to invest in the important R&D to support our customers and new product launches, fuel our long-term growth strategy, maintain our ongoing dividend strategy and preserve our ability to be opportunistic with our buyback program to fully deploy the free cash flow of the company.
 Lastly, predictability and business model resiliency matter more now than ever. Our growing diversification, significant exposure to our customers' critical process technology transitions, our subscription-like service revenue stream and our focus on driving operating leverage are key attributes of our business model. We are confident we can continue to excel in managing these areas and position KLA for a brighter future.
 Before we begin the Q&A, just a reminder that KLA will participate in many virtual investor webcasted conferences this quarter. Please keep an eye out for notice of future event scheduling, and we look forward to seeing some of you virtually later in the quarter.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kessel to begin the Q&A. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Charlie, we're ready for the first question. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Solid job on the quarterly execution. On the increased revenue guidance range for June, $280 million range versus $200 million for last quarter. You called out the COVID-19-related impact. It sounds like it's still more operational, logistics, personnel support. But I wondered if there's some part of that, that is demand related, potential pushing out of the business by customers either in your process control or Orbotech businesses on the potential for maybe some second half macro demand weakness. I'm just trying to figure out where the bias is skewed towards the larger range. 
Bren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. I hope you're doing well. So the bias is more around just the operational constraints. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are having to support the tools with our local teams, particularly around installations, and that can take a little bit longer. And as a result of that and the ability to handle escalations faster and so on, we've essentially put in some incremental risk -- or tried to account for some incremental risk in our overall execution.
 Clearly, the environment is very fluid by country. And so we have to be sensitive to navigate through that. There is a component of supply chain. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel very good about our supply chain positioning. So it's mostly more about the general uncertainty and what we're having to do operationally to deal with it. 
Harlan Sur: Okay. Great. And then congrats on the 300 basis points of share gain in process control last year. I think now you're about 5x larger than your nearest competitor. On your commentary on the sustainability of process control intensity for this year, where are you seeing the biggest sustainable increases of this intensity? Is it China and NAND? Or is it just across all of the sectors given rising complexity? And then it also looks like your large logic customer is executing and finally getting back to sort of this 2-, 2.5-year cadence on node migrations after a long pause and much reuse. How does this also change your longer-term view on intensity for the team? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Great question, Harlan. I think that the biggest difference we see right now, I think, in the process control intensity is the realization that EUV and those in support of it really need more capability. And specifically, we've talked about Gen5 in the past being used for print check, and that's definitely driving adoption.
 In addition, we believe the sustainability is there based on new products that we introduced that we outlined in our Investor Day. And so it's really not one particular customer. It's really now we have Gen5 is really humming at every major customer and is growing in adoption. And maybe in the last couple of years, we went from being in the development phase to people actually expanding their footprint with that.
 But we also saw strength in laser scanning. And so I think even optical metrology, we mentioned in there, it's really pretty broad-based across the portfolio. And I do think in times like this, even if customers are going to back off capacity, which could happen later in the year, they're going to continue to invest in capabilities that allow them to bring out new technologies, which is always favorable for process control. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Glad to hear that everyone is doing well. I guess, Bren, I want to go back to just the COVID-19 impact and whether or not you have a number that quantifies the March quarter impact. And was it an impact to shipments and rev rec or just rev rec? And I guess is the broader range for June just a realization that you're expecting the impact to be larger in the June quarter than the March quarter? 
Bren Higgins: So John, on March, when we go back to when we gave guidance, we certainly felt that there would be some potential risk of pushout related to tools that were going into the affected areas in China, particularly in Hubei province. And so we tried to account for that in our guidance and expected that independent of the COVID effect that our guidance would have been higher.
 As the quarter went along, our issues were more -- we were able to ship a little bit into that area, which was positive for us. And we had some other puts and takes across the business. The challenge we had is with quarantine periods and travel restrictions, it is taking us some time to line up resources. And if you don't have the resources for installations, customers will want to readjust some of those delivery dates. So we did have some of those issues in the quarter, and it was more shipment based than it was revenue.
 So as we look at the June quarter, though, I mean, it's a pretty challenging situation out there. And as I said in the demand -- or in the prepared remarks, I mean, demand from customers has been pretty consistent. We think that carries forward in June. And so we widened the risk to be prudent -- or the range to be prudent just given the circumstances we think we're now facing. But we did the same exercise tool by tool, and we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance. But just overall, we're learning things every day about what's going on, and so we wanted to account for some of this uncertainty that's out there. 
John Pitzer: And then just as my follow-up, despite the wider range for June, I think we all appreciate the fact that you're trying to give us a guidance number out there with all the puts and takes, even more so, Bren, your commentary about the full year. But I'm kind of curious. I think 90 days ago, you would have characterized calendar year '20 as sort of an above trend year for growth for you guys, trend being sort of the 7% to 9% that underpins your 2023 target model. Relative to the puts and takes you talked about in your prepared comments, should we think about 2020 as being more of a trend growth year? Or is there not enough visibility to even say that? 
Bren Higgins: Well, I think the visibility question is challenging. We have peer companies that couldn't even guide the quarter given some of the challenges. So when we look at it, I mean, it's hard to believe that we wouldn't see some impact into the second half from the environment we're now operating in. We do expect, based on our current view, that it will be a growth year for the company. But as I look at it today, again, a lot of moving parts. But I would say that it would probably likely be below that trend line. Not much below, but I think it'd be below. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I had 2 of them. First one, either Bren or Rick, can you give a little bit color on the sales into China that you saw in March? What is the split between domestic and multinational and split between foundry and memory? And any kind of color into the June quarter on geography would be helpful. Then I have a follow-on. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Krish, I don't think I have it by -- broken down that way. As we said, revenue mix for China was 25%. I don't -- it's something we'll have to get back to you at this point for the March quarter. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. That's fine. And then the second question I had was, when you look into your June guidance, when you look at the numbers, it looks like foundry is probably slowing a bit and memory is coming back. I understand no one has a crystal ball at this point, but would you expect the trend to continue to the calendar second half? Or is it more a function of just customer CapEx spending in Q2? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I mean I think our base assumption is that we'll see stronger memory environment in the second half. Obviously, that's part that might be -- part of the business that might be more impacted by what happens in the overall economy. But our base assumption is that we would see memory recover in the second half or be stronger in the second half. Now foundry seems -- the foundry and logic seems to be pretty consistent over the course of the year, at least at this point. So I wouldn't say it's weighted to 1 half or the other right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess first question, Bren, to go back to John's earlier question on COVID and the impact there. Can you share with us what kind of, I guess, impact to revenues you're embedding in the guide? Or should we take the midpoint as indicative of what you would do with or without indicating no supply chain issues? And then as part of the challenges around supply chain management and logistics, can you share with us what impact that might have on your cost structure as well? 
Bren Higgins: So C.J., at some point, it becomes a little challenging to be -- to speculate on with and without given the environment we're operating in today and the adjustments we've had to make. If I just go back a few months, I mean, I would think that our revenue would be $100 million higher at the midpoint from a guidance perspective for the quarter in a normalized environment. Now we're far from a normalized environment and don't know when we'll get back there. So most of our adjustments, though, are related to just our ability to cadence our resources to be able to support customers.
 As we said in the prepared remarks, for the year, demand is virtually unchanged. We have seen some impact in some of the -- with customers that are closer to some consumer markets. But generally, our customers, particularly our largest customers, are still very focused on executing their plans and we're maintaining the flexibility to be as flexible as we can to respond to them. So I don't feel like I have significant supply issues to be able to make that happen, and we're running the factories to be able to respond to that.
 So they want to be in the right position to respond to their customers, and so we're managing our supply chain and our factory resources to have the flexibility to do that. If the business were to fall off in a meaningful way, of course, we're carrying a lot more resources than the -- that business level would suggest. And so there would be some adjustment required in terms of just the overall cost impact of that. But right now, that's how we're running the business, and we'll adjust as we go. We've done this before. 
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. If I could follow up regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it's still very early, and I'm sure you're waiting clarity on how broad or narrow the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what's been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. And considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you've read today? 
Richard Wallace: Sure, C.J. I think that, to your point, it's relatively new. And we're still unpacking it. And as we said, we're working to gain clarity. But our understanding at this point is this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have 3 major manufacturing sites: Israel, Singapore and here. So there's a potential impact depending on the customer in our final understanding of the ruling that will impact tools that come out of California.
 But even that, based on the words we had and the comments we made, it's still unclear. And we're getting guidance on that and actually working through it. So we haven't been able to come up with more than that at this point. But we still -- as we look to the year, we feel -- as Bren said, we understand that risk and potential risk, and we feel good about the year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. 
Vivek Arya: So sticking with this China export control, and again, I appreciate that it's somewhat earlier in the process. But I think you mentioned you already restrict shipments for military end use. So I'm curious, what else do you need to do to satisfy these new requirements, right? Whether or not you ship the end product from the U.S. or from overseas, if according to you, you're not shipping something for military end use, what more do you need to do? Like what is the mechanical process, I mean, going and asking for a license if you are not shipping anything for a military end use already? 
Richard Wallace: So there's a couple of aspects of this as we understand it, but one of them is a rigorous process we're going through to make sure we understand the intent and the -- how to execute on this rule. And we're working with outside counsel, inside counsel to do that. And as we said, we already have some of the constraints. This was a broad policy, not simply about semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor equipment just happens to be included in this.
 So we will work through that process. But that is why we say that we already take steps to handle some of the questions that are being put forward, and we will continue to work through it. When we have more clarity -- and frankly, the rule is still -- there's still a period where further definition is happening until the end of June. So once we have more clarity, of course, we're going to share that. 
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, I'm curious, what have you seen from a demand perspective and just from any supply chain issues in the first few weeks of the quarter? Because just from the outside looking at it, it seems as if, right, there are expectations that second half would get better, that macro conditions could improve, that people are slowly starting to get back. That's why I'm curious, but is it fair to say that June is the trough for the year? Just what -- how would you characterize what you have seen for the first few weeks of the quarter from a demand and a supply perspective? 
Richard Wallace: So I think Bren -- this is Rick. Bren talked about the demand, but I'll give some color to it. I've had a number of conversations with customers. And I would say that everyone is continuing with their plan. The notable exception, as Bren mentioned, consumer facing and anybody that's dealing directly, for example, with automobile, I think that's an area where there's been constraint. But it's been compensated for by some of our other customers who actually see increase in demand driven by some of the work-from-home trends. So I think that in balance, we're seeing that.
 The supply chain actually got better in terms of some of the supply that we had in Asia, specifically China, where coming out of Chinese New Year, part of what we weren't sure about was the supply chain that we had in China, how effective they were going to be and how efficient. That's fully recovered, and we're back actually above the level of supply for some of those parts. And we've pretty definitely moved through the different opportunities for supply, and we feel very good about our ability to navigate that. As Bren said, it's not easy, but we're confident of our ability to do it.
 So we don't really see a reason to change it. So then what we're backing up to is what are the macro implications of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery. And since we don't have a way to really understand that long term because I don't think anybody really knows, we just model different scenarios for what that might look like. But we have no leading indicators right now of any real change in behavior. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. And just an additional point here is the internal forecast would suggest that the second half is stronger. I think the challenge we have to Rick's point is what ultimately happens with our customers' demand profile and what that means to supply. Now there are lead times with -- and so on, and those issues are things that customers have to contemplate as they think about how they're managing their capacity. But that's essentially where we're at. So we'll have to see how that plays out, what that ultimately means to them and then ultimately what that means to their demand for our products.
 We do have a certain amount of investment that happens in supporting technology road maps. Those are continuing on a normalized pace. And so we would expect that for products that are particularly focused on enabling technology transitions that those products would be more resilient than more capacity-centric products depending on one environment. But I'm not ready to call a trough here in the June quarter until we get better visibility about what ultimately thing -- how things will look in the September quarter is, I think, one of the challenges that we're facing here.
 We don't talk about it very much, but I think that the way we manage the supply chain is a competitive advantage for KLA. We talk about our operating model, and a lot of that has to do with how we manage supply chains, how we run our factories. We work with suppliers that provide very high end capability for us, and we engage very closely with them. We buy parts earlier. We commit earlier. So we're able to navigate through, certainly for key components, potential disruptions and working with them to make sure they're in a place to be able to support us in whatever environment we might end up in.
 We have the service business. It's very contract based. The products live a long time. So having extra parts from time to time is the least of my concerns generally as a CFO running this company. So I think that, that situation works for us. And with the extension of demand in terms of how it's affecting, how long products are living, we tend to work our way through the parts that we do have. So it slows down inventory turns, but it is fundamental to the operating model of the company. And I think the margin profile reflects that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, I also wanted to ask on the Commerce changes. It certainly looks like you have some cover on the direct product rule for the stuff being made outside the U.S. when you sort of look through the CCL list and at the ECCN categorizations. But the language around end use and end user seems to be very ambiguous. And I guess -- we obviously hope to get clear interpretation from Commerce before June 29. But the experts that I've talked to indicate that it's sort of purposely ambiguous. So I guess the question is, if you have to apply when in doubt, would you agree that the risk might be more on the foundry/logic side and less on the memory side? 
Bren Higgins: Tim, I think it's too early to speculate. I mean I -- yes, it's too early to speculate. 
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, Bren, I guess, a follow-up on the impairment. So 15% of the acquired goodwill was written down. So can you just quantify, did that have any impact on the sort of long-term growth prospect for the Orbotech businesses? Or do you think that even though that was written down that long-term numbers that were put into the model at Analyst Day still hold? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Tim, as you know, these are asset-light businesses. And so there's a fair amount of purchase consideration that shows up in goodwill. And what that reflects really is when you do valuations, as we all know, and you do a discounted cash flow that -- as cash flows push out and what discount rates you use have an effect on ultimate value. Certainly, in the near term, in some of those businesses, if you look at the specialty semiconductor business, being impacted by trade last year and some of the automotive dynamics into this year, that did affect some of our near-term focus -- forecast. So over the long run -- and then I think the second part is around flat panel where we saw -- we expected to see more recovery in flat panel CapEx into '20, and we're not seeing that.
 So there were some modest adjustments related to COVID and some of these issues that I mentioned and then just the general uncertainty in terms of how that affects an ultimate discount rate that you use. But to be clear, we do feel very comfortable with the growth rate trajectory that we presented at Investor Day back in September. And it's really a function of the things I talked about, just given the uncertainty of the current environment that we're operating in. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. 
Quinn Bolton: Bren, just wanted to ask on the gross margin. You guided 59% to 61%. Wondering if there's any impact from spacing requirements and social distancing on that manufacturing capacity or your cycle times within your own facilities. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. That's a good question. I mean in our facilities, most of our builds are bay builds, and so we're able to comply with some of the social distancing challenges there pretty effectively. So it's not really related to that. I think from a cycle time point of view, we're executing generally in line with our plans.
 Quarter-to-quarter, it's really more around just some of the mix of products that we expect to see this quarter versus last quarter. And the service profitability levels were particularly strong last quarter, I think, with some of the delays in just activity out there and so how that affected our cost structure. So I would expect some of those costs to come back as we move into this quarter.
 So overall, it was a little bit richer than we expected in the March quarter, and we're seeing some adjustment into the June quarter. But the long-term view at the current sort of expected revenue levels is to see gross margins between 60% and 61%, with the biggest factor being mostly around the mix of products. 
Quinn Bolton: Great. And then a follow-up question. You mentioned the 3 main manufacturing sites: Israel, Singapore and U.S. Wondering if you have redundant capacity to build the same tool at multiple sites. And if you don't have that capacity today, does the export control action and just the COVID outbreak make you rethink whether having redundant manufacturing capacity is -- would be part of a long-term 3- to 5-year plan? 
Richard Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. We have definitely the ability -- the similarity in what we do in these different sites allow us some flexibility, which over time has caused us actually to transition more to the sites out of the U.S. in both the case of Israel and also in Singapore. So that's something that we're always evaluating in terms of our ability and flexibility to manufacture different products in different locations based on customer needs, supply chain and our staffing. So of course, that's a lever and an option that we have as we look out and think about where the best place to be positioned is. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Yes. Looks like you're thinking about a nice sequential increase in implied memory revenue for the June quarter. I was wondering, can you help us understand the drivers of that? Is it more of a market recovery? Or are there also some kind of embedded assumptions around new product shipments that you've launched recently? 
Richard Wallace: It's funny, I went back and I looked at -- if you looked at the March quarter revenue levels for memory, it was probably our lowest since about 2016. So in some ways, there was a bit of a trough there in terms of just the overall business level for memory. So we do see a pickup. The pickup is pretty balanced across the -- it's about 50-50 overall of what we expect in the quarter from flash and DRAM. So I wouldn't say it's related to anything in particular other than just we're seeing a stronger revenue profile this quarter versus a very low one last quarter. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay. And then just on the record backlog, when we think about your comments around the long-term target for growth rate for 2020, how do we think about the backlog covering that relative to prior years? 
Richard Wallace: Well, we have record backlog today. So we had a very strong order quarter, record backlog this quarter. So that certainly gives us some comfort. I mean customer demand is there. We have the backlog. We have the parts. So as I said, we're in a position where we can deliver to any scenario. So we feel pretty confident about that. But we really just have to see where our customers are ultimately in what they do. But certainly, the backlog does give us confidence really across the businesses to -- with a certain expectation.
 But again, depending on what happens with their business, then sometimes they do push dates and things like that. But given the lead time for our products, the backlog gives us some comfort about what we see in front of us over the next 6 months or so. 
Bren Higgins: I think, John, as you think about the longer term, the 2023 plan, the biggest variable in that from our standpoint is really what happens in the macro economy because when we look at all the trends that we've said, the new products, the market share, the secular dynamics, everything is really working the way we had envisioned. And we're executing -- and we feel really great about that. What we can't forecast at this point is how deep and how long any kind of economic disruption is. So that's the thing that will really ultimately determine the pace of the overall industry.
 I do think that there are aspects of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry that are actually going to do quite well. So unlike general recessions we've had or the '08, '09, there's aspects of what we do that are enabling people to actually continue to function through this time period. But ultimately, if there's macroeconomic shock, it's going to -- depending on how long it goes, it will alter those plans in terms of the length of the time it will take to come out of this. And that's the thing we're in no position to forecast. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the call over back to the presenters. 
Richard Wallace: Thank you very much, and we appreciate everybody tuning in today. We look forward to chatting with you going forward. This ends the call. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-02-04 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter and Calendar Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Charlie, and welcome to KLA's earnings conference call to discuss the results of the December 2019 quarter and outlook for the March 2020 quarter.  Joining me on our call today is Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending December 31, 2019 that we released today after the market closed and is currently posted on the investor relations section of our website at ir.kla.com. Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. The detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. Our IR website also contains a calendar of future Investor Events and Presentations including those from our September 2019 Investor Day and Corporate Governance Information, including our quite period policy, as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our most recent Annual Report and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q.  Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick?
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. And thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with a high-level strategic overview aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I covered the near term December quarter of business highlights. Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying giving a set against a backdrop of still lackluster memory demand. As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients in the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity and advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes, as well as Megatron's driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries. Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model given that we spent a fair amount of time in our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it maybe which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did. Expected continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution height and accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor. Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's result point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these. Please turn to Slide 7 for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. I'll begin by addressing the Coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace. Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring this situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Non withstanding this hopefully short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets; the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and roll out of 5G; growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance in return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes. The demands of support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021 driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top-line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model. In terms of our outlook for the WFP wafer demand environment in 2020 given the recent news of increased CapEx investment from leading foundry and logic customers, and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth here for WFE coming off a stronger than anticipated finish to 2019.  Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7 nanometer node and beyond. We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of pattern wafer, print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019. An adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-Beam Inspection Platform in multiple years and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-Beam Inspection Platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership. This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today. We can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes. After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production ready version of the X-Ray Metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor day, the AXION platform is a small angle x-ray scattering technology for in-line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improved cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques. We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last but certainly not least KLA service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fabulus Asian and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses. Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive mode, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the New Year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions positioned KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day. Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. As we look ahead, we're confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and products energy programs are firmly on track and progressing well. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was at 34%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66. Both of which were also at the upper end --of the range of guidance at $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69 respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around and we remain laser focused on our overall execution, as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech. During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchasing consistently going forward. A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar 2019, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks. Please turn to Slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength and foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFP demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better than expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment from multiple foundry and logic customers. Investment in the EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process controlled revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8% versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations. I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor process segment. As a reminder SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and as a leader in TBD and H process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year -- to be a year of strong growth driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year. On a very encouraging note, SPTS has ended the December 2019 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year growth for PCB driven by the transition to 5G smartphones. Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows. Wafer inspection was 40%; patterning which includes reticles inspection was 19%; wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%; PCB displaying component inspection revenue was 9%; service was 24% of revenue in the quarter; other was 4%. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%; China was 25%; Japan was 13%; Korea was 12%; the US was 11%; Europe was 6% and the rest of Asia was 3%. Please turn to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher than expected in the quarter due to non headcount related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments. Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million. The effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%. Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income is $422 million and we had just under $159 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Please turn to Slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash. Total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter. Please turn to Slide 15 for review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019 it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth and operating margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR at 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company systemic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings. Please turn to Slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the Coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process. As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China both in Hubei province in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as the access key components from our China based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base. In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty and our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher to midpoint without the adjustments for the Coronavirus impact. Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% and semi process control system revenue in the March quarter depicting the strength we continue to see amongst our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue in next quarter. Based on product mixed expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margins to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%.  Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography. And initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year. For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share and non GAAP diluted EPS at $2.04 to $2.82 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9% earnings per share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress towards our 2020 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share. With that I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question to ensure we get as through as many questions as possible. With that Charlie, we are ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] You first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J.Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question you talked about 2020 year-over-year growth of high single to low double-digit. And based on the other segments, it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9% - 11%. So curious is that the right math? And then as part of that what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020 presumably a year with more memory which is an obvious negative, however, you have your new x-ray tool and growing share at NAND as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV. So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE both good and bad in 2020.
BrenHiggins: Yes. Sure. CJ, it's Bren. I'll go first here just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean certainly 2019 finished much more much stronger than what we expected which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to the last earnings versus where we are today given what we've seen in the foundry logic space. We'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much that we'll see flash memory recover. We would expect to see that through the year. And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecasts in terms of incremental WFE investment. So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, okay, where's the growth coming from so certainly our logic foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point.
C.J.Muse: Very helpful. And as my follow-up, how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business? I imagine that that's much more of a second half Apple weighted kind of ramp. So is there any sort of kind of range first half second half kind of mix there.
BrenHiggins: I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. We expect this year to be as Rick had indicated a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind in that part of the business we also have big chunk of it is also service where it's over 90% of its contract pay. So it -- there's a high service utilization on those tools and a stickiness to the investment as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. 
HarlanSur: Good afternoon, guys. Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020. Great services showing on process control in calendar year 2019. According to my calculations your services business was up about 111% and the upper end of your long term target of 9% to 11%. On your full-year view of 10% revenue growth for the business here in calendar 2020 based on your installed base growth in 2019 how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar 2020?
BrenHiggins: So I think when you look at the comparison to the year I mean certainly we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in 2019 that drove the growth rate to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side given the weakness in memory particularly in the first half of the year; it did push us down towards slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at 2020 though as we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory but also in the logic space over the course of the year, we would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there certainly that the contract penetration is as high as Rick had indicated. I think with rising utilization with new products given demand from customers as they ramp new facilities; we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus 2019.
HarlanSur: Yes. I appreciate the insights there. And a big part of the growth for the team has been draw of -- that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles right. Gen5, Teron for EUV as an example. So that then can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs like x-ray for stack profiling, e-beam both for wafer and medical maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues.
RickWallace: Yes. I'll take part of that and then Bren could talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products we introduced the AXION and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We're seeing POS now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before we're under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out 2023 the plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year. We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected and we're seeing momentum grow there. So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded and so Bren can talk a little bit of sizing.
BrenHiggins: Yes to Rick's point, I mean it is an important part of our strategy here to see the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings and customers. And so initial results are pretty promising and it's one of the really one of the factors as we look at those products whether it's incremental Gen5, print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab in EUV or whether it's e-beam to Rick's point or x-ray metrology. We're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in 2020 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady-state expectation for those business because we're starting to seeing the market with those products but we will see revenue and I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity a flat despite that the memory growth that we would expect to see in 2020.
RickWallace: The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll just for more perspective the Gen5 adoption is accelerated throughout the 2019 and now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications and where it's really gaining subtraction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think it's a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV. We're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now open. 
DavidWong: Thanks very much. Could you give us some ideas to what percent of your semi equipment sales out to domestic Chinese chipmakers?
BrenHiggins: I would say probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019 it was about $665 million on what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue.
DavidWong: Okay. Great. And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year-over-year for the March quarter, of course confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago. So can you give us some idea about what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year-over-year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech?
BrenHiggins: Yes. So we would expect and again with some range to this but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about 1,215 to let's say 1,230 - 1,235 in that ballpark. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.
TimothyArcuri: Thanks a lot. So, Bren, I'm just looking at the second half of 2019, I'm just looking at your process control system shipments. And you did 831 in September and you just did 875 in last September you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4. So that's up like small single digits year-over-year, but if I add together Intel and TSMC CapEx, it's up like more than 30%. So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher. I'm just wondering if maybe there's some timing effect there or how you sort of -- how you sort of reconcile those numbers? Thanks.
BrenHiggins: So, Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half over half in the second half versus the first half of 2019.
TimothyArcuri: Yes, Bren. I guess I was talking second half of 2019 versus second half of 2018.
BrenHiggins: Second half of 2019 versus second half of 2019 --
TimothyArcuri: Yes. Basically --barely up.
BrenHiggins: Yes. It looks like it's up a few hundred million.
TimothyArcuri: I guess the question is you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic so why would it be up so little when those guys CapEx is up massively. I mean it's up 30 plus percent.
RickWallace: Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period.
TimothyArcuri: Got it, Rick. Okay. So it's a timing issue, okay. Thanks. 
BrenHiggins: Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, it's not a way I've really thought about it. So we can follow up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean you get different customers, different customer mix. You have the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean if you look at our year-over-year performance in a down year for the industry it down what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly may be I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at this detailed logic was not all that strong for us over -- really over the course of most of 2019. So I think that the relative performance was pretty good in 2019 versus 2018.
RickWallace: Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer and we talked about that that 2019 was softer than 2018. And so some of the business you would have seen in 2018 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue.
BrenHiggins: Yes. Bare wafer was down; bare wafer was down about 10% year-to-year, so that was another factor as well.
TimothyArcuri: Okay. Awesome. Got it. And then, Rick, I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously you've widened the range, but I think you also said something about potential policy changes. What did you --were you referring to Export Control that could come about or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that? Thanks.
RickWallace: No. Just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- as you know rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China, but also Wuhan in particular and following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Santor with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
KrishSantor: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two one. First one for either Rick or Bren. If a look at your March quarter guidance, looks like sequentially foundries up while memory is down. I'm kind of curious how why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back? And secondly in an environment where people think foundry logic CapEx is front half loaded, should we assume that's how your revenues have to trend or is it tough to say at this point? And then I have a follow up.
BrenHiggins: Well, Krish, on the memory recovery is more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment and so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery or I'm sorry memory until we move into the second half of the year.
KrishSantor: Got it. And then just as a follow-up if the memory recoveries wouldn't be back half loaded and foundry logic is front half loaded, how does it impact your gross margin profile?
BrenHiggins: There are no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types, but customer segments doesn't drive influence our gross margin unless the product makes dramatically changes? But product is the same margin generally across all segments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
JohnPitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question, Bren, in your prepared comments you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3% to 5% higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the Coronavirus. I'm just kind of curious is that through the EPS as well or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number? And so EPS would actually be up more, kind of, had a higher revenue midpoint.
BrenHiggins: Yes. The assumption is really about revenue, it's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it affect our overall plan for 2020. So I would think that that business just shifts into the first part of, or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change but based on how we see it today that's how we're thinking about it. So the 3% to 5% is basically just comes off the top the same expectations for spending and of course there's a gross margin impact to that which is reflected in the guidance. So we widen the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in Hubei province but even broader China and how that restarts not just with customers but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now.
JohnPitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow on, Rick, it's always helpful when you get kind of your perspective at the industry. I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit; your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year 2020. Wondering if you endorsed that forecast? And if you don't want to get too specific with numbers, I'm just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE? There's a lot of concern that maybe it's front half weighted versus second half weighted. How do you kind of see the half on half both for WFE and your business this year?
RickWallace: Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, is very strong and very encouraging the number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong. And it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry logic and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength their. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view and as Bren just indicated it's earlier for us to size what second half and as you know, we don't give annual guidance. But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment and even if you look at the way 2019 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn it's pretty good downturn because 2019 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the Coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020 and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it and for us we definitely feel momentum and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demands and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number but we definitely feel more positive about 2020 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong 2019 ended.
BrenHiggins: John, and the only other things I'll add to that is to Rick's point, I mean look strength and timing to memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard and so certainly people have different views on that and depending on which markets that you tend to do better and you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is how much growth that we see in China? How robust is the growth? We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wildcards if you will is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side. So certainly there are a number of projects on the foundry logic side that are investing and overall but it's more foundry logic heavy. So I think the memory sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast. But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single low double-digit kind of range plus or minus and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year. Given the flexibility, we believe having the factory if it turns out that it's stronger than that we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that if that materializes that way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.
VivekArya: Thanks for taking my questions. I get that you're taking a conservative view to Q1. When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry, they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China that there is sufficient time to recover from it. So let's assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now, do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter or it's too early to make that determination? Like is there a demand destruction here or do you think that there is a chance for catch up here?
BrenHiggins: Yes. Vivek, so when I look at it, I think that business just shifts, part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business and Huawei or in Wuhan and in Hubei Province there. An impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area given it's the epicenter of the Coronavirus so far that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover. And so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that. Perhaps we're a little bit later than the others and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view and but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to, as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that will ship that capability in the June quarter and in that timeframe.
RickWallace: Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes to mind to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that and we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there, I think it's, if it's a temporary disruption it comes back and that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now.
VivekArya: Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past? And within that is it a difference between NAND or DRAM process control intensity?
RickWallace: There is higher, I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in especially in NAND had a huge desire for more process control capability. We just didn't necessarily have the solution so that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes and we're seeing adoption as a result of this new product. So that's driving process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking and so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements. So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions not so much by need.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
ToshiyaHari: Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. Just a quick follow-up on the Coronavirus impacts. Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain or have you received changes in terms of demand signals from customers or if you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative?
RickWallace: Yes. We're not seeing any change in the customer needs and in fact, if anything we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions and I think that that is something that we continue to model and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details.
BrenHiggins: But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems and its supply chain that could be dual sourced but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now when those suppliers are able to come back online, their people can actually get back into the factory we would expect to have very little if any disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed then it would have a broader impact and again another reason for the wider range and so.
RickWallace: And maybe the last point. I know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that they're still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off and so as they go back we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out.
ToshiyaHari: Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on SPTS. Bren, you talked about exiting the year with record backlog, it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year. In addition to RF, I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half, but if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year that would be helpful. Thank you.
BrenHiggins: Yes. I mean certainly 5G and increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G but also in the mobility cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive, there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in 2019. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in 2019, so we're comfortable or optimistic about seeing that part of the business recover. And I would expect SPTS if you add the two together both in terms of what 5G is driving and automotive you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth here for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities, packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
JoeQuatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. In the past you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looked to be in a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles. And then are those net new opportunities or are they competitive to put displacements?
RickWallace: Joe. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the, we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier over process control adoption stages back up and say the process control intensity in 2020 being nominally flat to 2019. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically and that's a function of the new products that we have, as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use case in terms of what we're seeing for example for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity improving as we see it in the memory specifically in the NAND.
BrenHiggins: Yes. I think to Rick's point I mean one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements and so as the stacks are rising flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so where we have capabilities for that and then certainly the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products and we feel pretty good about that both with new products from metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market. To Rick's point, DRAM with the introduction of EUV into DRAM even a single layer or two that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects which tends to drive our inspection business. And with the broader portfolio we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there are opportunities for we have to execute but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It'll never look like foundry logic but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute.
JoeQuatrochi: That's healthful. And then just as a quick follow up, your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020? I apologize I missed it. Is that still flat year-over-year?
BrenHiggins: No. It's one of the drivers that have changed these last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But, yes, I would expect to see it grow and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
SidneyHo: Thanks for taking my question. Just to following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter. I understand memory CapEx recoveries more second half but it does imply a sharp decline quarter-over-quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level. So what was driving that dynamics in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year?
BrenHiggins: Well, you have multiple customers investing in and right now when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression but very little new capacity particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shift into that business more in the December quarter, so it could be a timing issue between what we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it, but memory in the March quarter is kind of weak. And we expect to see it strengthened as we move through the year.
SidneyHo: Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow up is, sorry if this has been asked earlier but last quarter you had expected revenue to come down like 5% half over half in the first half of calendar 2020. And given calendar Q4 was much stronger does that change the slope of that and assuming that the Coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year. And how should we think about first half over second half for this year?
BrenHiggins: I think it's a relatively flat outlook half to half in the first half of 2020 given the assumptions that we have on the Coronavirus and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business. End of Q&A
Operator: We have no further question at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters.
Kevin Kessel: Thank you and thank you everyone for your time and interest in KLA, today. Charlie, can you please conclude the call.

===== 2020 Q1  (2019-10-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the KLA Corporation September 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] 
 Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Thank you. Sir, please go ahead. 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Christian, and welcome to today's KLA earnings conference call to discuss the results of the September 2019 quarter and outlook for the December 2019 quarter. I recently joined KLA, and today marks my first KLA earnings call. I'm glad to be here and look forward to meeting and talking with all of you over the quarters and years ahead. Joining me on the call are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ending September 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon after the market close, and they are also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.kla.com. Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slide presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website.
 Our IR website also contains a calendar of future investor events, presentations including those from our recent Investor Day and corporate governance information as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the Risk Factors disclosure in our SEC filings.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.
 With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? 
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter. 
 Please turn to Slide 4. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth, technology, leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance, a result of strong customer pull for KLA's solutions and focused execution, despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments.
 As a global leader in process control and supplier of process-enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges is the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple mega trends driving demand across multiple product generations in numerous key industries. 
 Please turn to Slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the company this way for a long time, but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses. The KLA operating model is essential to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor.
 Please turn to Slide 6. Strategically, we have 4 objectives that serve as our guide and drive our high-performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent Investor Day, but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These 4 objectives are: market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence, and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses, including acquired ones, with a focus on these key 4 objectives, and it shows in our overall results published today.
 Please turn to Slide 7 for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence, growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment. 
 KLA's strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum we see due to support, both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020, driven by investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and capacity additions. Given the recent news of increased CapEx investments in 2019 at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019, with KLA's Semi Process Control business, inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment market and growing modestly compared to 2018. 
 Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform, with customers now deploying Gen5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020, as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly, and KLA's advanced optical inspection platform is on the critical path to their success.
 The accelerating adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen5 demand in the near term. Also, at last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new EBEAM inspection platform in several years. I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial tool performance. KLA's differentiated EBEAM inspection platform works with Gen5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes.
 Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA. In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better-than-expected demand in the September quarter helping to contribute to the revenue upside we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology road maps.
 And finally, KLA Service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi Process Control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019, with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription-like service contracts. This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our Service businesses, including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration, and our Service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business.
 Please turn to Slide 8. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat, supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds and the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions, sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day.
 2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. Looking to 2020 and beyond, we're very excited about our prospects for growth and market leadership, building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren? 
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 for a review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA, with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also marked a new record for the company. Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was $1.413 billion, which was above the range of guidance of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61%, driven by incremental revenue growth and a stronger-than-expected semi process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48, both of which were also above the range of guidance of $1.75 to $2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34, respectively. Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter, as both cash from operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of $496 million and $464 million. We are proud of our financial results this quarter, and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward, with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition.
 A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders. On September 17, we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the tenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level, reflecting our confidence in our business strategy, the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it over time as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders.
 In terms of returning capital to shareholders during the quarter, we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $228 million of common stock and also paid $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon divesting of restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced, that the Board of Directors authorized, an additional $1 billion share repurchase program resulting in $1.6 billion available to repurchase under Board authorization at quarter end.
 Please turn to Slide 11 for a review of the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Review of the semi process -- revenue for the Semi Process Control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter, up 16% sequentially on the back of strength in foundry and logic. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 has improved modestly, driven by investments in EUV and stronger foundry demand. In addition, increased demand from native China is also contributing to this improvement, where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018. As I mentioned, foundry was very strong at approximately 44% of semi process control revenue, up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September, down from 52% last quarter; logic was 13% of total semi process control revenue versus 12% last quarter.
 I'll turn now to the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and edge solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications, like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million, up 3% sequentially. While we're encouraged by the market position of these products, SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market. Despite these near-term headwinds, we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis to calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment was $179 million, down 3% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. 
 Please turn to Slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows: wafer inspection was 32%; patterning, which includes reticle inspection, was 27%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our Semiconductor Process Control segment; Specialty Semiconductor Process was 4%; PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 9%; other, which includes bench-top analytical instruments and the KLA Pro mature products and enhancements business, was 3%; Service was 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 27%, China was 24%, Japan was 15%, Korea was 14%, the U.S. was 13%, Europe was 4%, with the rest of Asia at 3%. 
 Please turn now to Slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income and expense in the September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11%, below our long-term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in tax reserves related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S. Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward, you should continue to use 14% as the long-term planning rate. Net income was $398 million, and we had 160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.
 Please turn to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all 3 agencies.
 Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past 5 years, we have averaged just over 100% free cash flow conversion. And over the last 12 months, it's been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross margins, and ultimately, our free cash flow conversion.
 Please turn to Slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchased shares being slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussions.
 Please turn to Slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially, roughly 4% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundry is forecasted to be about 55% of semi process control system revenue in the December quarter, depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi process control system revenue next quarter.
 For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half. Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in a range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we are modeling NIM to be approximately $385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarter is due principally to the timing of non-headcount-related product engineering expenses for next-generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower-cost locations.
 We would expect to see an impact from these activities through 2020, with the return on these investments beginning in 2021. As we move forward to the March quarter, our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of $370 million to $375 million, as product development expenses normalize to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares.
 In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments in what remains an environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering strong relative performance, and we are encouraged by the momentum we see in our business. 
 Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or half-to-half trajectories for the year, we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment, with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019 as customers continue to progress their technology road maps and a strong demand environment, with improving competitive dynamics in diversified end demand.
 For memory, we expect a better year in 2020, and disciplined supply management in 2019 has improved the overall condition in both segments. Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control in foundry and logic, improving process control intensity in memory and contributions from new products, calendar 2020 is setting up for another year of relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we report earnings for December quarter.
 I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? 
Kevin Kessel: Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] With that, Christian, we are ready for the first question. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse. 
John Pitzer: Congratulations on the very solid results. Rick, I want to go back to one of your comments you made in your prepared comments about the Gen5 optical inspection platform. You mentioned that you expect shipments to double in 2009 (sic) [ 2019 ] and for that to still be a good growth driver in 2020. So I guess, I'm trying to get a sense from you, where in sort of the potential of that product cycle over time do you think we are? Maybe using a baseball analogy might be the right way to look at it. And as you think about logic/foundry being strong next year, to what extent is that just a call on laundry -- on logic/foundry CapEx versus perhaps a Gen5 product cycle that's still in the sweet spot and accelerating? 
Richard Wallace: Sure, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think if I thought about Gen5 right now and you want to use baseball, it's the third inning. It's relatively early in the life. We're now on the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform, and there are several iterations to follow. Engineering is being dedicated to that, but we're now starting to see broad adoption and really the beginning of adoption in production, where what we really had been dealing with for the most part, in the last couple of years, was during the development cycle. So we're still early on, and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become the HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production, and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is, we've seen more memory adoption in the Gen5 than we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we had originally envisioned. 
Bren Higgins: John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about at our Investor Day, there is an application for reticle qualification in the fabs for EUV reticles. So we're -- as we start to progress that use case, it's how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticles as they're being used in the wafer fab. So an incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving, but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen5 as it gets adopted. 
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And Bren, maybe just for my follow-up, I want to go back to the operating model you shared at the Analyst Day around op margin, sort of, bridge between now and 2023. You're already, kind of, ahead of the revenue -- op margin targets you gave in that model, both in the September quarter and in the December guide, and it sounds like December OpEx is unusually high per your comments. And in general, that op margin target you gave only assumed incremental op margins at the low end of your historical guidance. I'd hate to obsolete the model less than a quarter out, but can you talk a little bit about whether or not you think there's upside or conservatism to that model you gave at the Analyst Day? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, John, it's a good question. I mean, I think one of the challenges in putting together the model is it reflects a different mix of business that we have today but also expected moving forward. So clearly, in the September quarter and even in December what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business and that is behaving consistent with the historical model that we've had out there. So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction, you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we tried to reflect was based on our expectations for growth over time, what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business, we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it. 
Operator: The next question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. 
Christopher Muse: I guess, first question, on the foundry/logic side of things, can you speak to whether you're seeing increasing breadth of spending in that category and really focused on the leading edge? And as part of that, if you could speak to also reuse? That clearly was a headwind, basically from 20-nanometer down, but it sounds like 7 non-EUV progressing to 5 EUV, but that's a seismic shift here that is driving a real uptick in process control intensity. Would love to hear your thoughts on both of those things. 
Richard Wallace: Yes, CJ, I'll take the question, and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry/logic is -- it's not particularly broad. We expect it to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts -- design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there are so many different devices that are being introduced at these advanced nodes. So we don't suspect that there will be that much. The other thing is, we have new product cycle, which are really adding lot of capabilities. So obviously, customers are always trying to optimize their capital, and we'll see them be as efficient as possible. But we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen it in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns and also some of the additional challenges, the advanced nodes are pushing, even without broad EUV. And once you broaden out EUV, you get even more of that. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think the big difference between this node, and let's say, 20-nanometer, even down to 14, 16, is we're seeing much broader end market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing any reuse as that capacity is deployed to support all that activity, and a high-mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product windows. So it's a good story, and we expect this node to have some legs. And certainly, the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and strong expectations for that. 
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. If I could sneak in a quick second question. You talked about a return to $370 million, $375 million OpEx in March. And I guess, curious, how should we think about potential synergies related to Orbotech as we move through 2020? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, CJ, I outlined it at Investor Day. There's a number of activities that are happening, and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer-term structural cost reduction, namely, relocating some operations from subscale or higher-cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint. So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team, there's some incremental investment, but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range, I think we're in that range as we move in, based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line, we'll be operating in that range as we move through the year with the usual program development expenses that could cause you to move one direction or the other. I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range as we move towards the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, it's probably at the higher end. 
Operator: The next question is from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Co. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I just had a quick one, Rick, you kind of spoke about how Gen5 is going to double in 2020. Is that primarily coming from foundry's 5 nanometer? Or is there a significant chunk coming from DRAM adoption, too? 
Bren Higgins: So Krish, that was -- the comments were that we saw a doubling in '19 from '18. And although, to Rick's earlier point about Gen5, I mean, we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check, as that rolls in, in terms of how it supports EUV reticle qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen5. But we haven't quantified how much more. I mean, we are shipping both generations to support activity, both for 7-nanometer and for 5, but you'll see more adoption of Gen5 in production as N5. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. And just to add to Bren's point, what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer, major customer, in terms of the early evaluation and use so that sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19, where we got it out and established in all the leading jobs. 
Bren Higgins: Yes, I mean, certainly, Krish, just one other thing, as I look at the order profile, it would imply we're going to have growth in the number of units as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double, but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year. 
Operator: The next question is from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. 
Harlan Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. On EUV litho adoption and your mask inspection business from Analyst Day, I think we could gather that your reticle inspection franchise is going to grow pretty strongly this year, up about 45%. But if I look at the shipment profile for ASML, let's say, over the next couple of years, it's still a runway for very strong growth, around 25%, 30% shipping CAGR. With that in mind, how should we think about the trajectory of your mask inspection business looking into next year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. I mean, I think, Harlan, you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE year in reticle inspection and that's been adoption for the Teron platform, both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is, yes, the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer side as we see incremental capacity there. And then you'll start to see some activity as we move into next year. As we talked about at Analyst Day, we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that we'll start shipping in 2020 also. So you'll see a mix and match. But as we stand today, I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV, we believe we've got the market pretty well served with the capabilities that we're offering. 
Harlan Sur: Yes, makes a lot of sense. And then on the Specialty Semiconductor segment, you drove pretty good quarterly results despite given the trade headwinds. And so again, if I look at the trends heading into next year, you've got a big step up in RF content, in 5G smartphones, in infrastructure, you've got more power products in auto and industrial, and of course, all this advanced packaging and things like system and package. All of this should provide a pretty good backdrop for growth next year, but wanted to get your initial views in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 for SPTS? 
Richard Wallace: Right. Well, obviously, we're newer to that business. But as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers, it does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you've pointed out, we had some headwinds that happened in '19, but still managed to get some traction. '20 looks like a good year for SPTS. And our current modeling of it, based on what we see for the, as you say for RF supporting 5G, it looks like a, hopefully, a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So we feel good about it, and we're continuing to learn more about those customers. 
Operator: The next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri: Rick, so if I look at your WFE share this year, you're going to gain about 50 bps of WFE share, but I think a lot of people are looking at foundry CapEx and they're sort of worried that this is a near-term peak, at least here in the back half of the year. And if you look at the capital intensity numbers, like, we haven't seen these kind of quarterly numbers only really once in the past 20 years from kind of a quarterly capital intensity point of view for nonmemory. So -- also people are looking at TSMC CapEx, and it's kind of $5 billion in Q4, and that's kind of a $20 billion run rate. So how do you respond to concerns that this is sort of a near-term peak in foundry logic shipments? Is that not what you see? Do you see the quarterly shipment rates continuing to grow in foundry/logic next year? 
Richard Wallace: Sure, Tim. Well, it is true that we had strength, as we mentioned, and you're -- half-on-half considerable strength, but really not in a lot of customers. There are other customers that will broaden out in next year, and so we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing. So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half to this year. But we're counting on some broadening. And again, some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefit of that revenue next year. 
 Bren, do you want to add any color to that? 
Bren Higgins: No, I think Rick covered it. I mean, look, if you think most of the investment we've seen this year has been from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified end demand environment into next year, we feel comfortable given the comments we made in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability in foundry and logic as we move into 2020. 
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, I guess, I had a question on Orbotech. If you look at systems revenue, it was pretty flat. It looked like display was still pretty weak. What's assumed for December, Bren, for Orbotech shipments? And what's the outlook for the flat-panel display and the PCB business? I guess, the real question is, why is the flat-panel business still interesting to you? Because it seems like it's kind of on its lows, and it would be arguably accretive if you sold it because it has much, much lower margins. So just -- can you just, kind of, talk through all that? 
Bren Higgins: Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean, I will say that looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy, but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter and lead times there, that -- those deliveries happen in December. In that business, it's a build-to-order business, so usually when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well. So I would expect it to uptick. I think as we think about next year, I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after 6 years of growth, we saw 2020 -- or 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020 either.
 So we're focused on the business. I mean, I hear your points, and we're -- some of the actions we're taking that I referred to in terms of cost, structural cost, reduction actions are particular to that business. And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability at these trough levels and position that we can -- as the business recovers, that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first. I hear your point, and we'll see how it plays out over time. 
Operator: The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Vivek Arya: Congratulations on the strong growth. I had 2 questions as well. For the first one, I'm curious, what is the right way to think about process control and density in EUV versus non-EUV systems? I imagine EUV was not as big of a factor this year. Do you think it's a bigger factor for you next year? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. Process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers. I mean, obviously, the value of EUV is a reduction in layers. And so we would see that, that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV, but you really get process control intensity in a couple of ways: one, you get it in a mask shop because you have to do more inspection to assure that you have a high-quality mask. And we're still, as an industry, trying to work out some of the challenges, pellicle, nonpellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask; the other thing is in print check to verify and validate that Bren mentioned in an earlier question, we see that as an opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall, it's a plus for some of our businesses, it is a minus for some, but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance, it's a net positive for KLA. 
Vivek Arya: And my follow-up, how large was domestic China spend for you this year? And just conceptually, how are you thinking about it going into next year? 
Bren Higgins: Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said in the remarks, I mean, at the beginning of the year, we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18. And it turned out with some projects that came back into the year, one major one in particular, we're going to end up about flat. And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020, and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in, but it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the company. And I would expect that to stay relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020. 
Vivek Arya: So that is not part of the outperformance assumption for next year? 
Bren Higgins: No. I think -- look, I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean, certainly, it improved the performance in -- with a factor in performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year, no, I don't -- I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of how we're planning. I expect a flattish environment in native China. 
Operator: The next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. 
Quinn Bolton: Just wanted to follow up on the question from Vivek about EUV driving higher process intensity. I assume that that's true in the memory side of the business as well. So as we look at EUV insertion in 1Z and then 1 Alpha processes, do you see a meaningfully higher process control intensity in those steps as we see EUV coming into high-volume manufacturing? And then I've got a quick follow-up. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I mean, it's early for memory. As you know, they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers, but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense, again, for the same reasons. You have the mask shop and you have on the wafer, and you have a reduction in layers counterbalancing it. I don't think it's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up, but it's not a big change in the overall intensity, maybe on the order of, if you're going to be at an average of, say, 10% process control intensity, you might get 0.5 point to 1 point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends, but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately, it will also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do -- have pellicles. It will change a little bit in how it plays out for us. 
Quinn Bolton: Okay, great. And then a follow-up question was just, it sounds like you're getting a little bit more optimistic in the memory side of the business, and that might be somewhat driven by the indigenous Chinese guys. But just wondering if you could comment based on, sort of, orders for the Surfscan business. Are you seeing -- starting to see better activity in the NAND business? Or is it fairly isolated to certain customers at this point? You wouldn't call it, kind of, the beginning of a broader-based recovery? 
Bren Higgins: No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean, certainly, that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18, and so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that, which, ultimately, supports memory in 2020. But right now, I think it's too early to see that impact. So I wouldn't say I see that as a leading indicator of new business. But certainly, given the market position of that product and how memory drives wafers, if you do see a pickup in memory, we will see that business impacted. 
Operator: The next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Congrats on the results. As it relates to your service business, I was wondering if you could give us an update on some of the capacity idling that you've seen, particularly around the memory side in your installed base? And maybe, how do we think about that relative to your gross margin guide for the December quarter? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean, one of the things that we are seeing that drove an uptick in the revenue level for Service quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in idling, so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the Service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So look, you do have a gross margin impact to growth in Service on the overall model, which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally. And the thing to keep in mind is it with our Service business as it grows, the profitability stream, we believe, is an accretive stream to the overall total. So it's not affecting, I think, quarter-to-quarter, it has very little effect on the overall gross margin in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter, it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model. 
Joseph Quatrochi: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the specialty semi side, now I think you're calling for flat this year. Can you help us understand the -- was there any incremental impact indirectly from Huawei? Or is this more related to weakness that you're seeing in just general demand? 
Bren Higgins: Yes. It -- I wouldn't say it's the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter. So we continue to see that. And we talked about, if I recall, $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular. There are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean OSATs. So there are number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business. Now in the long run, as those customers in that area -- or the end customer, the customers' customer starts to redesign around some of these issues, it creates opportunities for us. So -- but in this year, it's affecting that business. Also, automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker, so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing, I think, a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in and would expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth, as Rick suggested earlier, but it's a business that has a really good market position. I think the long-term drivers around 5G, advanced packaging, power, and so on, are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see, and we like the business model of that business. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. And more specifically, I think on Huawei, if you thought about the reactions of the suppliers to Huawei was there was uncertainty when the -- they had first came in and trying to figure out, and I think everybody froze. So the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain. So we think that business ultimately comes back, but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now I think people are dealing with it and that will actually cause the business to resume its growth. 
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. 
Patrick Ho: Rick, maybe first off, in the past, you've talked about increasing metrology intensity on the NAND flash side of things, particularly as layers increased. As the industry starts shipping to 128 layers, do you see any potential new opportunities on the inspection side given the complexity of the layers and the increased number of layers for next-generation devices? 
Richard Wallace: I think the main opportunity -- it's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really in what's happening on the bare wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher, both the cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean, we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects and deep trenches, but it's probably more flatness-driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities. We talked about at the Analyst Day with the work we have on CD-SAXS, in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection, it's more about Surfscan. 
Patrick Ho: Great. As my follow-up question, in terms of the domestic China opportunity, obviously, we're seeing some of these capacity built begin and you're benefiting from new capacity build out. But given some of it is also trailing edge logic-type of capacity builds, is this simply because they are new capacity? Or are there opportunities within the, I guess, the foundry and logic segment of that region that you see new opportunities, both for your inspection and metrology products? 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I think that the -- there are a number of players that are small, maybe subscale, in terms of what you think of it as the larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region -- reason. So that, kind of, creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that. Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities, then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share but also good intensity. And then lastly, I think the move for auto, as China is an important auto market, there are more Specialty Semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result. 
Bren Higgins: Yes. Patrick, I mean, look, I think this year is a heavier memory year in China. Not by much, I'd say, probably of our mix of semiconductor business, it's 55-45 to memory. I look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT. Rick talked about automotive. And so the yield earnings challenges in logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shifting are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements, also providing some upgrade pass as they start to progress some of their technologies. So -- and they're serving, I think, real markets ultimately. And so I think that they're designing for specific opportunities, which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment and their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there. 
Operator: Your final question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. 
Toshiya Hari: Congrats on the very strong results. I just wanted to go back to the half-over-half kind of cadence for your business going into next year. You guys accurately called your core process control business being up, I guess, every quarter on a sequential basis, this year, a couple of quarters ago. So I guess the question is, based on customer projects, based on customer conversations, what are your thoughts into the first half of 2020 relative to the second half of '19? Do you think you can grow your business? Or should we be expecting more of a flattish outlook on a half-over-half basis? 
Bren Higgins: Well, like I said, I think we're little early to guide second half -- or half-to-half trajectory, then obviously, I think a part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean, across the segments, again, as we said earlier, we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry. I mean, if you just take a step back and look at the second half, up 20-ish percent over the first half, it does, obviously, imply that WFE is higher in the first half -- or the second half versus the first half, so the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year at these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half. You have to have that kind of growth to, sort of, sustain at this level of business. But I think that's probably as far as I can go at this point. 
Richard Wallace: Yes. I guess what I would add to that is we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're not in a great position to predict WFE. Does that make sense? 
Toshiya Hari: Yes, it does. As a quick follow-up. On China -- on native China WFE, I think, Bren, you talked about 2020, at least at this point, kind of, looking kind of flattish relative to 2019. When you think about the mix of spend on process control, could that move higher? Or what are your preliminary thoughts on that? 
Bren Higgins: Yes -- no, as I said earlier, I think it's balanced across the business that we expect, and we expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So I'm not expecting -- at least for our business, not expecting growth but not expecting decline in 2020 at this point. We'll see how it plays out. But that's the least where we stand today. 
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Kessel for closing remarks. 
Kevin Kessel: Yes. Thank you, Christian. And thank you, everyone, for your time today and interest in KLA. Christian, please conclude the call. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Have a good day, everyone.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-08-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us for today's call. Q4 was another solid quarter for KLA with results finishing above the midpoint of guidance demonstrating the company is benefiting from our strategies for growth in market leadership while delivering strong relative performance in a challenging year for the industry. I'd like to provide some insights into today's equipment demand environment. Even with the signs of stabilization and NAND pricing, DRAM continues to be weak and the business environment in memory is soft. This has resulted in broad based low levels of investment as customers have idled existing capacity and delayed new capacity plans as they focus on rebalancing supply and demand. The weakness in memory is being offset by rising demand from foundry and logic, which are traditionally strong markets for KLA. The business environment in foundry and logic is expected to continue to be strong through the second half of 2019 and into 2020, driven by next-generation technology development, capacity additions at the leading-edge, increasing competitive dynamics, and investment in EUV infrastructure. Altogether our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 remains consistent with the initial view we held in January, with demand expected to decline by approximately 20% in the year and with a significant shift in product mix to foundry and logic. Now I'd like to update you on some recent product highlights from our semiconductor process control business. KLA's market leadership is enabled by successful execution of a portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're very pleased with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we're experiencing across our portfolio. For example, we are currently seeing accelerated adoption of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, which is now in its second iteration since first being produced in 2016. We expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 compared to the previous year. Customers are leveraging the combination of sensitivity and throughput in this platform to enable unique detection of yield limiting defects at significantly lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives. The strong customer adoption of Gen 5 and the continued success of the Gen 4 platform, now in its fifth iteration, are further confirmation of the success of our multi-generation platform strategy for innovation and market leadership in optical inspection. Further, the latest generation of our laser scattering optical inspection platform, known as Voyager, is also enjoying strong adoption in the marketplace. Leading memory and foundry customers are deploying Voyager for in-line monitoring application in high-volume manufacturing. In mask inspection, the strong momentum which we have experienced over the past several quarters continues and is positioned to extend through 2020. We are seeing upside from leading foundries for our latest generation mask inspection platform and expect demand to broaden as customers move ahead with our EUV deployment strategies. In metrology as WFE is transitioning more toward logic and foundry, we're seeing strong adoption of the new film and CD platforms released last year as our customers ramp complex technology architectures like finFET, new materials and new metal interconnects. And with the recent acquisition of Orbotech, we are further diversifying our business, broadening our product portfolio and growth opportunities and serving a larger market. Integration and synergy activities are now well underway and we're very excited about the growth opportunities in combination with Orbotech. We look forward to further discussions on this in our upcoming Investor Day in September. In summary, despite uncertainty in the current industry demand environment, momentum is building for KLA driven by strength in our semiconductor process control business and contributions from the recent acquisition of Orbotech. As a result, we are on a path for strong relative performance in 2019 while we continue to drive innovation and introduce differentiated products and solutions to serve the market when growth re-accelerates. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the Q2 financial results. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks Rick, and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue in Q2 was 1.258 billion and above the midpoint of range of guidance. GAAP earnings per share was $1.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78 each finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Total shipments were $1.354 billion approximately $79 million over the midpoint and exceeding the high end of the range or guidance for the quarter. Semiconductor process control shipments were approximately $1.080 billion. We are pleased with the results we achieved in the June quarter despite significant noise and uncertainty in the global electronics market. As we continue to focus on executing our business across all markets, and move forward with our integration and synergy plans from the Orbotech acquisition. Beginning this quarter, we will report our results under the new segment reporting structure that we adopted subsequent to the completion of the Orbotech acquisition and you will see this reflected in our Form 10-K when it is filed. Under this new structure we will report the KLA process control business in the semiconductor process control segment and will separate the former Orbotech businesses into two segments; specialty semiconductor process and PCB display and component inspection. The latter segment now includes the former ICOS component inspection business of KLA. We believe this new segment reporting structure best reflects how our business is organized and the unique characteristics of each segment in terms of channels, markets, and technology. Results from the applicable services components will also be included within each segment. In addition, the June quarter will the last quarter we report shipments in our earnings call and we will no longer provide shipment guidance going forward. As explained in detail on the earnings call last May, under ASC 606 revenue recognition, the overall timing of revenue shifts forward and as a result, the difference between shipments and revenue is immaterial and does not warrant the resource commitment to maintain dual reporting. Subsequently, investors can assume a close approximation of shipments to reported revenue in any given quarter. Now, for the June quarter results, as I mentioned total revenue in the fourth quarter [ph] were $1.258 billion. We expect total revenue to grow about 7% at the midpoint and be in the range of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion in the September quarter. And for the second half revenue level to be higher than the first half with continued sequential growth expected in the December quarter across all our business segments. I'll now turn to some detail and commentary regarding segment revenue trends in the June quarter. For the semiconductor process control segment, which as stated represents all legacy KLA, except our component inspection business, revenue was $1.003 billion in the quarter. component inspection revenue was just over [indiscernible]. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 remains mostly consistent with our original view from January with KLA benefiting from stronger foundry and logic demand. I will note that on the margin over the past six months, although review of the overall demand environment in 2019 is unchanged, the near-term outlook for foundry and logic investment has improved offset by declines in memory. In fact, over the course of the June quarter we've seen our overall second half expectations improve modestly. Our current view for the semiconductor process control businesses is for the second half revenue to be up in the low double-digits versus first half of the calendar year as we now expect revenue from foundry and logic customers to be up over 35% versus the first half. Memory investment remains weak and directed towards technology migration only. Memory was approximately 51% as semiconductor process control systems shipments in June and we expect memory to be approximately 42% of system revenue in the September quarter. Foundry was 35% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 44% of system revenue in Q3 [ph]. Shipments from logic customers were 14% and the current outlook is for logic revenue to be approximately flat in September. Turning now to discussion of the semiconductor process segment, the former SPTS division at Orbotech. SPTS is a leader in PVD and etch solutions in fast growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices, as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $67 million. June quarter results for this business were impacted meaningfully by the U.S. Department of Commerce ban on shipments of RF and MEMS semiconductors to Huawei as customers with Huawei market share delayed planned capacity investments. As the leader in etch and deposition tools for these markets, SPTS saw a delay in a portion of its expected business due to this ban. Though the longer term implications of this action are not clear, notwithstanding this issue, SPTS is still expected to deliver year-over-year pro forma revenue growth in calendar year 2019. Revenue for the PCB display and component inspection segment was $185 million. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's ICOS component inspection business. Results for this segment were in line with our expectations for the quarter and are on track with our plans for this year. Now I'll discuss the distribution of revenue by major product category in Q2. Wafer inspection was 32%. Patterning and which includes reticle inspection was 23%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the semiconductor process control segment. PCB display and component inspection revenue was 10% and specialty semiconductor processes 4%. Other, which includes solar, instruments, and the KLA pro mature products enhancements business was 4%. Service was 27% of revenue in the June quarter. In terms of regional split of revenue, China was 32%, Taiwan was 25%, the U.S. was 15%, Japan was 10%, Korea was 8%, Europe was 6% and rest of Asia was 4%. Now for more detail on the results and the P&L. Gross margin was 58.9% in June at the top end of the guided range for the quarter of 58% to 59% as a higher level of semi process control revenue offset the Huawei effect on our specialty semiconductor business. We expect gross margin in the September quarter to be in the range of 60% to 61% as the more favorable product mix in our semi process control business and higher expected service margins drive gross margin improvement in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe there are many opportunities for us to improve the Orbotech gross margin profile across the businesses by leveraging our global supply chain, service infrastructure and global footprint. We will discuss these initiatives in more detail over the coming quarters as we get a firm picture on the timing and financial impact of these actions. Total operating expenses were $370 million in June below the guided $375 million target due to lower than expected expenses across the business and some synergy benefit from Orbotech. Operating margin was 29.5%. We expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019 consistent with the timing of our planned product development investments and the realization of initial synergy activities. Other income and expense in the June quarter was $38 million and we expect OIE [ph] to be approximately $36 million this quarter. The effective tax rate was 13.7% and going forward investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at the 40% level given a new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit. Net income was $289 million and we had 162 diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Now for some highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.7 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. Cash from operations were $325 million and free cash flow was $270 million. We are making infrastructure investments to support our future growth, including the construction of a new building in our Milpitas Headquarter site, and a new facility in Ann Arbor Michigan. We expect annual capital expenditures to exceed [indiscernible] over the next few years due to these projects and other infrastructure investments necessary to sustain our future growth expectations. In the June quarter we've made an aggregate of $121 million in regular quarterly dividend and dividend equivalents upon vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $345 million of common stock at an average share price of just below $112 per share pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $900 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. For September we expect fully diluted share count of between 159 million and 160 million shares. In conclusion, the June quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance with our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across our broad product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019 and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in our business. With that, to summarize, guidance for the third quarter [ph] is revenue between $1.31 billion and $1.39 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 a share to $2.34 per share. Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to remind investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We look forward to seeing you there. I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A we request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please feel free to requeue if you have any additional questions, which we will accommodate as time permits. Jerome, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You are now live.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. I appreciate letting me ask questions, congratulation on the solid results. Rick, it's good to see foundry and logic performing strongly in the calendar second half's expectation that continues into 2020, I'd be kind of curious, as you look at the memory market and differentiate between NAND, DRAM and maybe process control and bare wafer, how do you think that market plays out in the back half of year, which quarter do you think it bottoms in and how do you think about the recovery potential in 2020?
Rick Wallace: I'll give you some thoughts and then let Bren weigh in. Right now we don’t see, as we said, we don’t see a lot of momentum in DRAM. I think what we've got now is some strengthening I think we think in the foundry and logic as we said, but not a lot other than technology migration and not a lot of capacity. So if you think about when the recovery might come for NAND probably first half of 2020 and DRAM what our customers are saying now is more mid 2020 timeframe before we would see any meaningful change.
Bren Higgins: Yes, John, I would say that I'd characterize the market as what we're most is seeing the technology migration investment only and one thing about KLA is since we do help our customers navigate their roadmap transitions we are seeing some level of business from some of these customers. There is also some activity in China. We saw some last quarter shift influenced our shipments and we expect to see some more in the second half of the year. But to Rick's point, I think as we look at the overall market I wouldn’t expect to see any meaningful capacity as until we get into 2020. And given that customers have been disciplined and pushing out capacity they have been idling capacity. How quickly that comes back is a little early to tell from this point. You mentioned bare wafer, on the bare wafer side we see our business at bare wafer being roughly flat into the second half of 2019. Now 2019 overall for that business is lower than it was in 2018. We had a huge inflection in 2018. We've seen it come off a bit in 2019, it probably comes off a little bit in 2020. I think we're operating that at a more sustainable or higher level for that business moving forward given the dynamics around memory, around specifications both for inspection, but also from metrology. So, and the numbers that we provided in the commentary I think that's been part of our view in terms of expectations moving forward. So I wouldn’t say that much has changed there and that's certainly we've been pretty open about.
John Pitzer: Well that all, I got it. And maybe as my followup, Rick I'd love to get your comments on just inspection and process control intensity in foundry and logic as you move to 7 and then 5 and I guess it's kind of a complex equation. How does EUV going to fit you guys in the business going forward?
Rick Wallace: Sure, John. I think a couple of things, one we mentioned the strength in Gen 5 and a lot of that is driven, of course logic is going to drive that harder than we're seeing that transition from Gen 4 to Gen 5 in terms of the bulk of our system. So the design will shrink. We're going to drive smaller deep activity requirements driving toward the Gen 5. The other thing that's happening is overlay is a big driver for us in terms of the additional pressure put on our customers as they drive advanced design rolls. Eventually we're seeing that in a couple of ways. One, we're seeing it in our shop with the number of starts, pre-EUV but also the anticipated large number of EUV, but also the print down checks, because I think what's really going to happen for a while as people are going to want to verify the designs, so another use for Gen 5. So overall, we think there is going to be an increase in process control intensity as we introduce EUV I think that that's more in the development phase. Longer term I think it levels out a bit as we get into high volume production later. But right now definitely the mix is favorable to us in terms of what we're seeing. We also mentioned increased competition in foundry and that's also been a driver I think to the mixed shift overall.
John Pitzer: Thanks and congratulations.
Rick Wallace: Thanks John.
Bren Higgins: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. You are now live.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarterly execution and strong outlook. In terms of the strong results and outlook, specifically within your mask or reticle inspection business, EUV system shipments, looks like they are going to grow about 70% this year. If I look into next year, the installed EUV base is still growing about 50% to 60%. So given your guide is very high market share at the of mash ups how do you see your mash up inspection business directionally and do you guys already have visibility into the directionality of this segment next year just given the long lead times and continued growth of the installed base?
Bren Higgins: Yes Harlan, it's Bren and I'll go first here, but if you look at the reticle inspection business couple of things are driving it. First, significant tape-out in the foundry at 7 nanometer and so that's driving significant purchasing of the product. You have to remember that reticle inspection in a mash up behaved somewhat to process, when you are inspecting every reticle before you ship it to the fab. So it has some unique dynamics in terms of how customers buy relative to the design starts and they move together. That's one dynamic and that's driving the business. The other obviously is the EUV development activity that's also driving the Teron system. So you have both effects, but frankly the biggest driver today is more around the design start at 7 and it is driving that business to have nice solid growth in the year obviously where WFE is down. So we're seeing growth in that and as Rick said in his prepared remarks, we would expect that to continue into 2020. Timing of the EUV deployment and how we see that plays out next year, it will potential influence some of the upgrades to the existing install base out there, but there is some sustainability in the business and we're seeing a nice recovery in it. And then we'll see that next generation products as they come out as we move into the second half of next year to support EUV directly. So there's a lot of exciting things happening in that space and we're seeing the numbers flow through in terms of P&L impact.
Rick Wallace: I think just to build on one aspect of it, I think the fact that we have extended the Teron platform to be able to handle these EUV layers, yes we benefit whether or not depending on the number of EUV layers, we still benefit because we've got an optical platform that can handle either the mask for EUV or for traditional lithography. So I think that's a part of why we're benefiting more depending on the starts and just the intensity of the advanced nodes, not necessarily just on the EUV because it's still not clear how many layers and at what nodes they are going to be adopted, but we're seeing strength in reticle regardless of which way that goes.
Harlan Sur: All right, thanks for the insights there. And then you guys were thinking 90 days ago that there was an upward bias for the Orbotech business moving into the second half of the year, but just given all of the China trade overhang, given that Orbotech has a number of large customers, do you guys still see the second half of this will be better for the Orbotech team and if so, maybe a bit of color on what segments are improving in the second half? I mean I would assume that specialty semi is doing well just given the strong focus on RF and power, but what about FPV and PCB?
Bren Higgins: Yes, so growth expectations for specialty semi have come down a bit for this year directly related to the Huawei effect. The indirect effect, but you do have customers in the RF space that have market share with Huawei phones and so they've more cautious and in some of their plans for capacity and that's impacted that business. So that business is still going to grow year-over-year, but probably not to the degree that that we expected 90 days ago before the ban came out. I would say PCB and flat panel, are in line with our expectations, PCB flattish, flat panels down this year, but most of the growth for the business is going to come from specialty semi. So there's still some growth there year-to-year, but but a little bit less given the Huawei effect.
Rick Wallace: Yes. But just to put it in perspective Harlan, we're still within a few percentage of what we had originally modeled in terms of profitability and contribution to KLA for the business. So it still looks good. As Bren said, some kind of shifting dynamics, so not really that different from what we thought earlier in the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, great job on the execution. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You are now live.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I guess the first question Rick is that, there have been some other companies in your broader sector that the past couple of weeks have talked about, some pull-ins from China that are sort of helping the back half of the year. And I know you talked last quarter about a big project that was out of the second half and now is sort of back in the second half, but what are you seeing generally in China? I guess, is it your view that the trade stuff only increases the pace of these projects as you kind of look into the back half of the year and into next year?
Rick Wallace: We have definitely seen some puts and takes in China to the point, but we're seeing what others are seeing, where so maybe increased urgency in terms of the second half to get those projects fully up and as you know, there's just a lot of noise in the system. In terms of what effects might come in. The only substantial thing we've seen is a very small part of our business as Bren mentioned, but overall, pretty much where we thought in terms of the second half having some strength in it.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think the DRAM project, I mean it's interesting at that start beginning of the year, we thought it was completely out and wow it looks like we'll see it ship in the second half of the year. We're seeing to Rick's point some puts and takes related to some of the wafer plants in China. So overall I would say our expectations for China business this year versus where we thought are probably on the margin, slightly higher than where we were before, but not a lot of change there overall.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay Bren, thanks. And then I guess is the second question, I'm wondering if you can quantify in the spec SMEs segment how much the sort of indirect Huawei there, is it something like $10 million to $20 million a quarter, is that what it's costing you sort of into the back half of the year? I'm just sort of trying to baseline what the business would look like if this ban had not, or is not in effect?
Bren Higgins: Yes, so Tim, I think in the immediate quarter and you'll see some adjustments to plan meet the quarter, the impact was between $20 million and 25 million and certainly some of the strength in other parts of our business helped us achieve our results for the quarter. That number probably goes up to the $35 million-ish plus or minus as we move into the second half of the year in terms of our expectations. In total, so probably somewhere around $35 million to $40 million impact on calendar 2019. In the long run, it's interesting as those, as other providers that are non-U.S. providers start to ramp their capacity that creates an opportunity for the specialty semiconductor business there. So in the long run, and they are in an inferior position, so in the long run there potentially a big opportunity out there in terms of how the designing around the supply chain works. But in terms of the current year, the impact is probably somewhere between $35 million and $40 million in total.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, guys, awesome. Thank you so much
Rick Wallace: Jerome, next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. You are now live.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. First one for Rick or Bren, I know you guys have not given out your guidance, but if I look at some of the commentary you made in terms of strength of foundry lasting into first half of '20 and NAND in first half and maybe DRAM in the second half of '20 recovering, is it fair to assume that your legacy KLA, the business is going to be up in calendar '20 versus calendar '19 and if so, what is the risk to that guesstimate? And then I had a follow-up.
Rick Wallace: Yes, so let me take the first part and then give it to Bren. So we're not going to call it legacy. It's a process control business now that we have other businesses and the trajectory is good. We're going to get into more discussion of the outlook at our Analyst Day next month, but definitely, we feel like things are coming our way in terms of the right kind of market momentum, the advanced design rule work that's going on. In addition, some of the competitive dynamics, we talked about Gen 5 strengthening and some new projects, new products hitting the market. So we feel very good about overall position and Bren can talk in broader terms.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think we feel pretty good about logic, foundry and sustainability of spend levels into 2020. So I think if you look across those end markets and you look at the activity there. We would expect to see continued investment. We talked about competitive dynamics, the strength of the 7 nanometer node out there is also limiting how much reuse customers can do, and so that's certainly having an effect as well. You'll see automotive and industrial hopefully start to come back next year and so as you think about the broader demand across all of logic, foundry, I think there are a number of drivers that give us some confidence moving into next year about those segments.
Krish Sankar: Got it, okay. And then as a follow-up, you guys, introduce a new e-beam wafer defect review product recently and I'm kind of curious, how do we think about the coexistence of Gen 5 and e-beam down the road for your product portfolio and is this e-beam kind of just targeted towards specialized applications, so just kind of curious on how to think about the lay of the land for your products? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Well, I think what we said all along is we think there is a complementary role for optical and e-beam and this continues that. I think that what we have in our latest technology is a very capable e-beam tool that when our customers utilize with our advanced optical they really get the best of both in terms of capabilities for the market. But I don't think there will ever be a day where there is not a complementary e-beam solution with optical. Optical keeps getting better, e-beam has to get better too, but I think the general mix between e-beam and optical will remain about the same in terms of the way customers spend their dollars. But we're very excited about what we've seen in the market and we think the synergy of having our optical tool, coupled with our e-beam is really great for our customers trying to solve some of their very challenging problems.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. You are now live.
C.J. Muse: Great, thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to follow up on that last question regarding your expectations for sustainability of foundry, strength to continue through 2020. I guess within that could you speak to, I guess both your positioning within Gen 5 EUV, e-beam, perhaps new products that you haven't announced yet, but you just highlighted? And then also from an end market perspective in terms of rising competition as you look at Samsung coming in, we'd love to hear, I guess in more detail your thoughts on that front?
Rick Wallace: Yes. So, this is Rick. I'll talk more sentiment than actual numbers in terms of 2020 because we really don't know, but you can always to higher customer is behaving and what the mood is in the market. And right now we're actually in a situation where we see a lot of energy around our customers pushing for new capability, pushing for getting their advanced designs out, you see a lot of tape-outs, the mask business has been good, so definitely feel strong. The other thing and not to be missed, what Bren mentioned is, we don't see a lot of reuse happening because of some of the challenges of the new technologies. So that was something that we were trying to really map out and see what it was going to look like and the combination of new capability on our side, new challenges on our customer side, make us feel like it looks very strong in terms of the momentum. How long into '20, we don't really have great visibility into that. It's just now we have a case where you've got multiple players really concerned about bringing out new technology and ramping new devices, and at the same time we're hitting with some products that are new to the market and very exciting for us.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful, thank you. As my follow-up, could you I guess speak a little bit to your expectations for growth in the service bucket, both for process control as well as for overall Orbotech?
Bren Higgins: Yes, CJ, so in process control for those process control customers we believe we have a long-term trajectory somewhere in that 9% to 10% CAGR opportunity over time. We're adding tools to the installed base at a much faster rate than they're coming off, so that creates opportunities for us. 75% of that revenue stream is contract based because of customers desire to keep those tools up and how they buy process control also just a general complexity of what we sell. So that's good for that business. We've seen it slow a little bit in the near term related to just some of the idling of capacity that's well understood in the market. But over the long run we've seen it grow at that rate and we expect it to continue to grow like at that rate over time. The PCB business for Orbotech it has a strong service profile, say 95% of the tools are under contract, so of the PCB revenue we reported about 40% of it is service stream. So because of the imaging technology and the need for that tool as enabling for circuit boards, that's a positive trend for that business. I think on the flat panel side, there is very little service activity in terms of some consumable parts that are attractive, but there is some opportunity there for us certainly. And on specialty semiconductors, as we think about how we try to leverage our position in working with customers to offer better solutions over time there might be an opportunity for us to help customers that way on the specialty side. Smaller companies always have a harder time with service just the broader footprint. So maybe what we end up doing is enabling a better cost position for both flat panel and for specialty semi, but a lot of opportunity for us moving forward I think in terms of driving that straightforward for the company.
C.J. Muse: Thanks, Bren.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You are now live.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. First on gross margins, so you're guiding gross margins up 160 basis points or so, 60% or 61%, what's driving that and should we expect margins to continue to expand as your sales potentially grow again in December?
Bren Higgins: Well, as I said last quarter, I thought there were some unique effects affecting the June quarter from an overall mix perspective in our semi-process control business. Not all our products carry the same margin and under 606 it's whatever you ship is ultimately what you revenue. So some of that was a bit dilutive to our margins, drove the margins down to the almost just short of 59%. Moving forward, obviously we have some growth in revenue and that's helpful. We're seeing a reversion sort of back to a normalized mix on the process control side and I'm expecting to see stronger and higher utilization rates out of the service business in some higher margins in the service overall. So all those are driving us into the 60% to 61% range and I would expect to see that as we move into next quarter as well. So a normalizing effect that I telegraphed last quarter off of the June number, and it seems like that's where we expect to see the overall as we move into the next six months or so.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up. Rick, I'm curious how resilient has your core process control services business been in this cyclical downturn versus what do you assume what went well what did not go as well. Every time we get into a downturn, we always hope for the resilience of that business, but I'm just curious as you look back, how resilient it actually was over the last several quarters?
Rick Wallace: Yes, sure. It was pretty resilient. I think that as Bren mentioned, there was a little bit of softening we saw, but overall, we still see healthy growth rate. It was a little bit under what's been modeled for the long term, but we actually think we'll catch back up with that long-term modeling for a lot of reasons. I mean, I think that the utilization on some of the fabs has obviously been decreased, but there the service base is so large now and there's a lot of value in keeping those tools up and running. So we feel pretty good about it. Still, and I think the slowest quarter was still in load upper single digits, so pretty good about 8%.
Bren Higgins: Yes. Back in the worst downturn we've ever had, I mean it's always held up pretty well. Right? And it's, I think the other thing about that business for us is it's bigger now right? And it's growing faster than the systems business. So bigger is the percent of the total, so a solid anchor with we believe an earnings stream that's accretive to the overall. So, I think the dynamics are intact. It goes to the points earlier about how customers buy service that they need the tools up, they need matching performance, there's general complexity that's hard to deal with and for all those reasons, they tend to rely on us and want a contract stream to ensure the uptime of those products and even in difficult environments they still tend to run the tools and there is a certain amount of business that is there for us.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. You are now live.
Joe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the gross margin puts and takes for some of the new products that you launched last month. Can you just help us or remind us how we should think about this gross margins ramping over time.
Bren Higgins: Yes, you know, Joe, it's something we've been talking about. I mean, anytime, and it really goes back to how we introduced products at KLA. Typically when we're bringing products out into the market our focus is on use case validation and driving applications and adoption. And so, we usually come out with a product, we're trying to prove it out, and the margins typically are a little bit lower than what I would say the mature iteration of the previous platform. Then the engineering team starts to design for cost, we start to look at ways to second source. And as we introduce new subsequent iterations to the product that the margin profile improves. So, any time we have a new one come out, it is a little bit lower and then over time it catches back up. So it did have an effect on the margin profile as I mentioned in the prior quarters and I think we'll see that play out as we move over the rest of this year and into next year. With a big portfolio like we have, we tend to see some products where there are different stages of that maturity cycle, so they tend to offset each other. But, generally, part of what we do at KLA is ensure the value of what we deliver to customers in terms of how we price and discipline around that. So we ensure that what we are able to deliver product-by-product is pretty consistent and usually over time, we're able to drive more and more value out of it and I would say that we're not any different today with the latest round of products.
Joe Quatrochi: Okay, that's helpful. And then on the e-beam side I was just curious if you could share any kind of early customer feedback that you've gotten so far, maybe how should we think about the initial ramp for adoption of that solution?
Rick Wallace: The industrial feedback and we're still, we're out in a number of sites and we're getting feedback and we're doing demos, feedback is good. We're not ready to start modeling it into the numbers yet, because it does take a while to get the adoption of these platforms going, but we feel pretty good about the technical capability and the production worthiness. It does as I say, take a little while for customers to adopt enough to contribute meaningfully when we're at a $5 billion run rate.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I would say the portfolio approach that we have these products fit with the portfolio. You've got common capabilities across the tools, common algorithms, common other options and that help drive out - incremental performance out of the inspectors. So with the review or even baseline ground truth reference tools it helps sort of enable the broader franchise. So that's the approach we've taken at KLA, it matters more than ever today with the challenges in the production process, the size of the defects, the noise that happens on the wafer. So across all of that, having those capabilities that independently are tough to sometimes markets aren't always all that big, but collectively across the portfolio, create a lot of value for our customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. You are now live.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the nice results and outlook. I'm really just wondering, you mentioned the strength on the Gen 5 tool, you guys introduce the fifth iteration of Gen 4 last month, just wondering what demand you're seeing for the older Gen 4 systems as Gen 5 ramps?
Rick Wallace: Well, it's, think of it like a lithography mix and match. So what you get is, you end up with customers deploying the most cost effective solution they can that has the capability that they need and that really cascades starting with e-beam, then getting to 39xx than 29xx, and then the new Voyager platform. So it's really - the easier layers are harder than they used to be on the advanced node. So customers will deploy where they can the Gen 4 and then they'll put Gen 5 up against the problems when that's the only way to really solve them. Did that answer your question?
Quinn Bolton: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the China question, you referenced some puts and takes, but generally, perhaps a strengthening in that market versus 90 days ago. Do you have any sense as to the demand strength, I mean you're seeing more of a timing shift where projects are getting pulled in or do you think that this is just an acceleration in the roadmap for some of those indigenous Chinese fabs? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: I don't think it's as much about, - I think what happens is, there is uncertainty may be about their own plans and their ability to procure tools. So that may be pushed it out and then when they realized they could do it, pulled it back in. I don't want to speak for them, but I think it's more that the projects getting solidified. And I think 90 days ago maybe that was more on par is to see if they can even get the tool sets. So that's kind of where we are. It's not so much about end demand. I don't think as them staying on some of their plans. And by the way, there are a lot more programs there that we already derated. If you go back a couple of years ago and had listened to what customers have said, we're getting closer and closer to what we anticipated for 2019 and a going run rate for 2020.
Quinn Bolton: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You are now live.
Sidney Ho: Thank you. If you look at the capacity build for the upcoming 5 nanometers, how do you think the rate at which the capacity is being built is compared to previous, now let's say, to 7 nanometer or 10 nanometers? Wafer that the pilot line for 5 nanometers, could be little bit bigger than in the past, but just want to hear from your perspective of what is driving that kind of changes?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think that, and I'll go first here. I mean, we are seeing a little bit stronger adoption level and to the point earlier, you're seeing less migration of other tools from previous nodes, and so that's driving a certain amount of activity. I would expect it will probably be somewhere between 80 and 90 k wafer starts and for 5 nanometers get into that sort of through the first part of 2020 or maybe that's towards the end of 2020. So I would say that because of some of those other dynamics related to 7 we're seeing perhaps more activity for us on the 5 nanometer node.
Sidney Ho: Okay, maybe. And then my follow-up question is on the China strength that you guys expect in the second half. It seems that you guys talk about the DRAM project being pulled in, but my understanding is that, is that true that a lot of that revenue you have already seen it, because it seems like they have gone, most of those customers have gone past the initial yield improvement stage and from here on out, it's more on the production level type of run rate?
Bren Higgins: Well, like I said, I mean there some puts and takes in the overall level of business in China. I think it's slightly better than what we thought before, but there is some rationalization of wafer capacity that's happening likely as well. So, while you do have some strength around this because DRAM project, you do have some other moving parts. I think the way to think about this business is more about proving out technology roadmaps and then moving on to the next node. So there is some amount of capacity that gets added, but then there is a lot of effort to progress down the technology roadmap, and because of that we're seeing more engagement than you otherwise might, because yes yields are slightly improving on the trailing node that they happen to move to the next node, then they are challenged again and need to upgrade certain parts of the tool set. So that's driving a more continuous level of business, not just with this customer, but with other customers. And you might see when you're at some node and then go ramp it to significant volume production as and you'd see in one of the leading-edge memory fabs. It's a little different behavior smaller fabs and more of a focus on trying to move down the technology curve than then just ramping a lot of capacity.
Sidney Ho: All right, that's helpful, thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. He will now. Your line is now live
Brian Chin: Good afternoon, this is Brian Chin on for Patrick. Thanks for allowing us ask a few questions. Maybe a few questions on the PCB and flat panel markets, PCB first, the overlay of Huawei might also cloud things a little bit here, but of the major Smartphone ecosystems, it sounds like China has been a laggard in terms of adoption of [indiscernible] line space SLP and SAP manufacturing. So have you begun to see the China leader or leaders begin to adopt to the Orbotech, or now KLA, imaging products this year or are we still earlier on this adoption curve for them as we - and maybe you'll see that more as we move into next year?
Rick Wallace: Yes, it's still not yet. I think we do expect that to see that and the current expectation is, as you say it's probably next year, probably the third guys to do that.
Brian Chin: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe pivoting to the flat panel, from an early planning perspective, obviously a week spending year environment this year, but do you see any lead indicators, early indicators through for your product lines, like the AI [ph] tool that suggests we could see a meaningful pickup in the spending environment come next year and if you do, does this increase your urgency to pull in some of the cost synergies relative for that 24-month horizon?
Rick Wallace: We don't, right. It's too early for us right now to see 2020 picking up. I do think we had some marginal improvement, off of a bottom, but I would say that it's probably later than that. And to your point, we are actively working some of the synergy programs there.
Brian Chin: All right, thank you.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You are now live.
Harlan Sur: Yes, hey guys, thanks for taking my follow-up question. On the strong adoption of the Gen 5 wafer inspection platforms, this I think it was originally targeted for sub-7 nanometer nodes over. We keep hearing that customers are adopting Gen 5 for yield improvement even at some of the older nodes, and we also hear that Gen 5 has been adopted earlier by the memory guys. And then you also have EUV print check as another use case. So, how much of these types of buyers are driving the strength in shipments this year versus the real leading edge development activities?
Rick Wallace: We haven't thought about it in those terms. I probably half and half, though, I mean if I thought about it. It's broad use in development. I think what happens in especially since we make improvements to it and drive the productivity of the tool up, then it starts to be competitive in terms of cost of ownership with some applications for Gen 4. But a lot of this, as you might imagine, the discovery aspect of a new product is, you're not really sure what it's going to find and what value, it's going to create. So now what we're seeing is significant value as you say, even in some maybe more traditional places and frankly what we originally expected was, in some places people might have tried to deploy e-beam inspection, they get away from that by leveraging the much higher throughput of the optical platform. So we kind of see it broadening and feel very good. It took a little while, but we feel very good about the progress there.
Bren Higgins: I think the customers are seeing more and more demand, more and more activity at these other nodes to that that's driving more yield challenges, and so now the tool is faster and so the debugging challenges they're having at even at prior nodes now using the Gen 5 capability to Rick's point, you have a whole bunch -- whole lot of headroom add that enable customers to use that tool for full wafer coverage type yield analysis that didn't exist without the Gen 5 product line out there. So, given the demand there, and how much activity is happening across new designs at those nodes, you're seeing more debugging that's happening there as well.
Rick Wallace: So, just one last dynamic, I think you may know that what a lot of customers do is, it takes them a while to prove out the capability of the tool before they release it even internally for broad years. And so what we've seen in the last couple of quarters as we've kind of broken through at some critical places where they have broader ability now to deploy outside of the first people who were just evaluating it. So that really opens up a number of use cases and hence the significant progress in Gen 5.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thanks for the insights.
Rick Wallace: Thank you. Harlan. That's all the time we have for today's call. Jerome, if you would conclude the call with the final commentary.
Operator: Thank you for joining KLA Corporation's fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-05-06 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, my name is Jerome, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood, KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future Investor Events, Presentations and Conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Ed. KLA delivered strong results for the March quarter, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance for revenue and above the range for Non-GAAP EPS. We achieved these results despite the near-term softening in the wafer fab equipment market, showing the resiliency of KLA's business model and the compelling value of our strategy is focused on market and technology leadership, revenue diversification and operational excellence. We also closed the Orbotech acquisition in Q1, and work has begun to execute integration efforts and realized revenue and cost synergies. The value creation opportunity in the combination with Orbotech are compelling. We are further diversifying our revenue streams and expanding our reach in the global electronics value chain, enhancing our ability to serve new and existing customers in fast growing end markets, such as 5G infrastructure, smart mobile and automotive to name a few. Now I'd like to point out key reasons why the combination with Orbotech is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Orbotech shares core values with KLA, as well as a proven track record of enabling customer success, having long distinguished themselves for market leadership, innovation, technology and talent. Orbotech's market leader in each of the segments it serves, and there is no customer overlap in the PCB and flat panel markets. And there is no product overlap in the specialty semiconductor and advanced packaging business. Now, we are serving a larger and more diversified market with a broader portfolio of products and solutions. Orbotech business diversified, serving different segments each with their own cycle dynamics. Orbotech's revenue in calendar 2018 grew 16% to $1.04 billion, with a three-year CAGR of 12%. Of note, the specialty semiconductor business grew 23% in 2018 and is poised for high growth again in 2019, against a backdrop drop of broad-based weakness electronics manufacturing. Turning now to today's semiconductor market environment. Based on consensus industry reporting, WFE grew in the mid-teens in 2018, which is significantly higher than was previously projected. Process control intensity remain flat in 2018 in a year of strong memory investment. We are seeing higher adoption of inspection and metrology solutions for memory customers to support the 3D NAND roadmap and scaling to tighten design rules and DRAM. EUV was also a key factor in 2018 equipment spending, including process control infrastructure and reticle and optical wafer inspection. Given the expectation that EUV investment will continue in 2019 and together with a large percentage of foundry and large spending in the WFE Mac mix. We expect process control intensity to increase in the calendar year. The Gartner report for 2018, shows KLA held strong market share and process control. Thanks to our differentiated product portfolio, technology leadership and strong customer collaboration. Consistent with our peers, we expect WFE will be down approximately 15% to 20%, in 2019, largely due to weaker DRAM demand, NAND investment is also expected to be down in the year. While foundry and logic investment will increase, driven by the 7-nanometer ramp, EUV development and the steady trailing edge demand to support 5G infrastructure, IoT and automotive applications. 2019 will be a dynamic and exciting year for KLA, despite the current market turbulence, we are well positioned to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and our business execution competencies to show good relative performance in the year and emerge even stronger when the market rebounds. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren, for his review of the financial results. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thank you, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was a busy quarter for KLA. We launched our new corporate brand in January, closed the Orbotech acquisition in late February, executed a $1.2 billion debt financing in March and delivered results that met or exceeded the updated guidance for the June quarter we issued on March 5 after the close of the acquisition. Total revenue in the quarter was $1.097 billion at the upper end of the revised guidance range of between $1.025 billion to $1.115 billion. GAAP earnings per share was $1.23 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.80, finishing above the range of guidance. Non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $1.78 at the 14% long-term tax planning. We are pleased with the results we achieved in Q1 and are off to a solid start for calendar 2019 consistent with our expectations. We are now moving forward in our plans for integration of Orbotech and focusing on strong execution and operations excellence across our business. Due to the close of the Orbotech acquisition, there are meaningful differences between the GAAP results and the non-GAAP results. I encourage you to review the reconciliation between the two contained in our press release. The remainder of my comments here today are based on the non-GAAP results. As this is the first quarter we are reporting combined results for KLA and Orbotech, we will provide income statement, cash flow and balance sheet for KLA inclusive of Orbotech in addition to customary disclosures in demand commentary. Bridge results to the original guidance we provided back in January for semi process control business, we will share details on the financial results for this business and Orbotech separately. We are disclosing this additional information is a means for investors to better understand the dynamics of the KLA and Orbotech businesses in the stub period. Looking ahead, as we move forward in integrating the businesses, we plan to transition our disclosures and financial reporting to reflect the results and operations for KLA on a consolidated basis. Now, for the March quarter results. As I mentioned, total revenues in the first quarter were $1.097 billion, product sales accounted for 72% of total revenues. We expect total revenue to grow about 14% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.21 billion to $1.29 billion in the June quarter, with sequential quarterly revenue growth expected to continue through the calendar year. For both the semi process control business and the Orbotech business, we expect the second half revenue levels to be higher than the first half. In terms of regional split of revenue for the combined company, Taiwan was 25% of revenue, China was 19%, Korea was 18%, Japan was 13%, the U.S. was 14%, Europe was 7% and the Rest of Asia was 4%. Now I'll turn to some detail on commentary regarding demand trends in the March quarter for the semi process control business. Semi process control revenue, which includes the traditional KLA systems and service businesses was $936 million in the quarter. The expected overall demand environment for 2019, in the semi process control market is consistent with our original view from January with KLA looking to benefit from strong foundry and logic demand growth, reasonably balanced across the year. And with the expectation for the current soft demand environment in memory to persist throughout the year. Weak memory industry demand continues to influence our customer's caution towards their equipment investment plans. While we have some visibility into plans in this segment, they remain fluid given the current industry outlook and customer commitments could change quickly and without warning. We remain optimistic about long-term memory equipment demand, due to raising capital intensity to deliver bit growth supply and disciplined financial management by our customers. However, due to the consolidated nature of our industry, any shift in customer delivery requirements could impact our near-term results. Semi process control shipments were $957 million in Q1, above the range of guidance of $860 million to $940 million. As expected with the adoption of the new accounting standard for revenue recognition. The difference between shipment results and revenue for KLA is immaterial and largely a function of short-term timing dynamics. As a result, we will continue to guide and report shipments through the June quarter, but we'll move to revenue only disclosure for business units, geographic distribution and customer mix, beginning with the reporting of the September quarter. In short, under ASC 606, the difference between shipments and revenue was not sufficiently material to warrant the cost and effort require to maintain dual reporting. We expect total shipments of $1.235 billion to $1.315 billion in Q2 with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion. Memory was 38% of semi process control system shipments in March and we expect memory to be approximately 47% of this mix in the June quarter. Foundry was 54% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 41% of the total in June. Shipments to logic customers were 8% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 12% in Q2. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group for the semi process control business was wafer inspection was 42%, patterning was 30%, including shipments for reticle inspection, service was 24% and non-semi component inspection was approximately 4%. Now for some additional details of results from the Orbotech businesses in the quarter. A reminder that these results are for the 39 days stub period following the February 20th close of the acquisition. Revenue was $161 million above the guided range of $145 million to $155 million for the stub period. The semiconductor device business delivered strong revenues for the first quarter and momentum is expected to continue throughout calendar 2019, driven by strength in PVD and edge applications for RF, power and advanced packaging. This business is the market technology leader in targeted specialty semiconductor segments and is delivering faster revenue growth rates in the overall semiconductor equipment market and demand drivers include automotive, 5G investment and MEMS/sensor applications for IoT as well as growth in China. The printed circuit board business grew 10% in 2018 and is positioned to deliver solid relative performance in 2019 compared with the broader electronics market. Orbotech is the market and technology leader in critical applications in the PCB manufacturing process, such as laser direct imaging, optical inspection for defect control and repair. The PCB division will introduce several new products in 2019 to meet the requirements of new technologies such as mSAP and flex PCB and capture the future growth resulting from increasing PCB complexity. Additionally, the service component is an important aspect of the overall value proposition for this business and is approximately 40% of its total revenue. Similar to the semi-process control service model PCB service has a high percentage of recurring contract revenue and is focused on value-added services such as application support and software upgrades and not just basic break-and-fix services. The flat panel display business reflects the current weak overall industry demand conditions in LCD and OLED manufacturing. This market is experiencing a digestion period is leading display customers realigned their product strategies and production capacity to shift to new technologies. Advanced Panel design, such as high-end jumbo OLED TVs and flexible portable displays are becoming more expensive and complex to manufacture, featuring smaller pixel sizes increased pixel density in multiple layers. As the market leader in test repair and inspection solutions for FPD, our business benefits from new capacity growth, as well as from an increasing technical complexity in the next-gen display market. Though the market environment is challenging in 2019, we believe we are well positioned when the market recovers. Turning now to financial results for the combined company. Gross margin was 60% in March, slightly better than the implied gross margin associated with the updated guidance, as product mix in the semi process control business was mostly consistent with what we modeled in January. In June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 58% to 59%. Gross margin in the semi process control business is expected to be slightly lower quarter-to-quarter as modest volume benefit of higher revenue is offset by the expected product mix. For KLA consolidated gross margin, in addition to expectations for our semi-process control business, the change quarter quarter-to-quarter is also the result of approximately $90 million of additional Orbotech revenue representing a full quarter of revenue for this business. Based on our current outlook for business unit performance and overall revenue levels for the remainder of calendar 2019, we expect stronger quarterly gross margins in the second half and you should model gross margins for the combined company in the range of 59.5% to 60.5%. As in past M&A, we see a number of opportunities to improve Orbotech gross margins over time as we leverage our global manufacturing scale shared and common supply chain, service infrastructure, and internal supply capabilities. Total operating expenses were $311 million in March and operating margin was 31.6%. For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $375 million at the midpoint as we will incur a full quarter of Orbotech operating expenses and a modest increase in R&D expense in our semi-process control business. Given our topline expectations and planned product development investment profile, we expect quarterly operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar 2019. I would note that OpEx includes stock-based compensation expenses Orbotech, which is previously excluded from there non-GAAP public reporting as an independent company. Operating expense synergy planning related to the acquisition is underway and we will provide periodic updates on our progress in this area over the coming quarters. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $22 million, including the impact of the debt service to fund a portion of the transaction for the stub period. Going forward you should model quarterly OIE at approximately $35 million principally due to the incremental debt in the capital structure to fund the acquisition and other corporate activities including our ongoing share repurchase authorization. The effective tax rate was 13% in the quarter, given the new corporate tax structure in the US and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, including the contribution from Orbotech, investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at 14% going forward. Net income was $283 million and we had $157 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. During the quarter, we issued approximately 12 million shares as a component of the transaction consideration for the acquisition. We are expecting weighted average share count for Q2 to be approximately 162 million shares. Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.9 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. As stated earlier, on March 13th, we issued $1.2 billion of 10 and 30-year senior notes with a blended coupon of 4.4%. Our gross leverage ratio at the end of the March quarter was 1.7 times within our target range of 1.5x to 2x gross leverage. Cash from operations was $164 million and free cash flow was $138 million. We paid an aggregate of $114 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalent upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $200 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $1.2 billion available under our current share repurchase authorization. We expect to execute this repurchase program systematically over the next 12, 18 months, subject to market conditions. In conclusion, the March quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance and relative strength for KLA and a weaker overall WFE environment. We completed the acquisition of Orbotech integration and synergy activities are underway. With a diversified end markets, market leadership across a broad product portfolio and operations discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019. And what is expected to be a challenging year in the electronics manufacturing markets. With that to summarize, guidance for the June quarter is revenue between $1.21 billion and $1.29 billion. GAAP diluted EPS of $1.90 to $1.39 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.55 per share to $1.85 per share. Total shipments are expected between $1.235 and $1.315 billion with semi process control shipments of approximately $1 billion in the June quarter. Before turning the call over for your questions, we're pleased to inform investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 2017 in Midtown, New York. We will have more details to follow in the coming weeks and we look forward to seeing you all in September. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Theodore Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions and we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, given the limited time for today's call. All right Jerome, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Timothy, your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a couple. So Bren, just on the gross margin guidance 58% to 59% non-GAAP, it's a little lower than, if you just sort of do the math for the two companies. It seems like it'd be in the 60% to 61% range. So, first of all, can you sort of talk, is there like a one-timer happening in? And then sort of snap up into the '60s maybe for the back for the back half of the year? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. So, yes, I mean this quarter, there is some just mix dynamics that are driving the margin a little bit lower than you would think. And as I said in the prepared comments that we would expect gross margins in the second half to be higher. At the end of the day on our core business, it's going to move around on product mix across the different products or is bringing revenue in it at about $255 million in the quarter. We expected to grow in the second half as we said in the comments. And their gross margin is trending in the high 40th percentile. So, when you blend it out that we end up, but I would expect the second half margins to be higher, which is why I gave the full calendar year commentary as well that modeling somewhere between 59.5% and 60.5% for the year.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, awesome, Bren. And then maybe, and I know probably you'll go through some of this at the Analyst Day, but can you give us maybe some milepost as the business grows into next year and the year after, sort of what the financial model looks like, and maybe just pick like $6 billion as like an annual run rate once you get to 1.5 billion quarter, what is the model looks like? What's gross margin and what is our margin look like? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes. So Tim, I want to get away from or I want to get into to necessarily guiding out further. And so this is just need just thinking about where the numbers might line up, obviously the comments I made around product mix. Our issues that obviously would affect our performance. But, yes, I think gross margins probably settle in at those kind of revenue levels in the between 60% and 61%. Certainly, operating expenses are going to move, according to product development requirements. And then, of course, there are some synergy opportunities that we're going to be executing. So the time-frame that we were to get to those kinds of numbers that you referred to would be a factor and all of that. So, the way we presented in the longer term model was a couple of points of dilution related to the Orbotech transaction to our longer term model that we published, which - so I think that, when you're thinking in the mid-30 kind of percent operating margin range on those revenue levels. So, hopefully that helps.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, Bren, thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Vivek, your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the overall demand environment. I think when the year started the industry view was that WFE would be down 10% to 15% - it's down 15% to 20%, not just from you guys, but obviously from all of your peers. What's the slope of recovery here? When do you think the start to get visibility as to when we will see a recovery in overall spending?
Richard Wallace: Yes, this is - I'll take part of it, and then this is Rick and Bren can add in. It is true that the rate of decline, the magnitude is higher, but that's largely because December finished stronger - 28 finish stronger than - 2018 than we had originally modeled. And so if you look at what the overall numbers we're talking about for 2019. We're still in a similar kind of range $45 billion to $46 billion with WLP. So that was really the way we're looking at that. And we'd also said in the past that this is really starting to strengthen even into the June quarter, but the second half as Bren indicated in his comments are going to be stronger for KLA, but also for the industry.
Bren Higgins: Yes, the only - to Rick's points, the year-over-year ratios are moving around given the strength of the finished 2018 now that everybody has reported. And so it looks like 2018 is a little bit stronger. So our view is very consistent with what we thought in January. We saw mid-40s WFE levels for the year with the March quarter being the bottom and sequential growth for the Company resuming in June and continue in the second half. So second half stronger than first half. Foundry logic reasonably balanced across the year was our perspective. So, what's interesting is we are three months later and his played out as we thought. So, I don't think there's anything really different than what we thought a couple of months ago. And certainly, we are watching the end market dynamics and what those ultimately will mean to just given the consolidated nature of our business to our customers' investment plans. But so far, playing out as we expected a few months ago.
Vivek Arya: Thanks. And for my follow-up, China, so the demand from China, do you think that is kind of trending down in line with the overall WFE? Or are you seeing any more disruption because of trade tension or is this just an absorption period of because what they installed last year. So what I'm getting with that is that as we hopefully get some easing of tensions, do you think demand from China will improve at some point?
Bren Higgins: Yes, we've had puts and takes around China. We disclosed shipment profile in January that we thought to be down between 10% and 15% in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018. And our view is pretty consistent with that. We've seen some strengthening from certain customers and we came from others. So our general view is pretty consistent overall, so it looks like we'll see more foundry logic investment this year. And certainly, you have the OEMs that are investing both in terms of - or the need for wafer capacity materials, wafer capacity and reticle capacity. So I would say for 2019, our views are pretty consistent thousands what we thought a few months ago. I would say that on the trade tensions, I'd say that was a factor early in the calendar year at the end of last year of uncertainty. And now I think the way China is behaving as more just based on the way the overall industry is behaving relative to demand, and so we're seeing those plans are gated on that, not as much on concerns around trade.
Vivek Arya: Thanks. Very helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Harlan, your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On Orbotech, there's been some headwinds on the display, CapEx trends this year as you guys mentioned, but the move to OLED by some of their customers should boost capital intensity for their products. In PCB disappointing handset unit trends, but again offset by the move to things like mSAP technology and more automotive goodness there, SDD continued strong, so a number of puts and takes, but this is on the June quarter guidance and sort of backing into the full quarter March revenues for Orbotech in your comments about second half. It does appear that Orbotech will drive higher revenues versus calendar year 2018. Is that a fair assumption?
Richard Wallace: So Harlan, when we look at the business today, and again, we only had it for the 40 days of the first quarter. So we do expect sequential growth through the year. I would say, or Orbotech that will be in the ballpark of what they did in calendar 2018 based on what we see today, perhaps slightly less. I think given our relative to prepare - given the environment overall for electronics in terms of just softening and digestion that's happening out there. Looks like the business has been pretty resilient for the reasons that you described. And certainly what we're seeing on the semiconductor side is that's an area of WFE where there is growth in investment. And so, we would expect to see that business grow more in a more meaningful way in 2019 versus 2018.
Bren Higgins: And then longer-term, Harlan, we're - we believe we're on track with the architect plan that was laid out in 2017, when you talk about the longer-term trends all seem to be very positive and we're excited about what we've seen. We think the Company is well positioned with the assets as part of KLA and we'll continue to build on the momentum, as you say FPD has had some headwinds, but there's been some good wins in the other parts of the business.
Harlan Sur: Yes, absolutely. Good insights sir. Thank you. And then looking at the Gartner shared data for 2018 in your flagship optical inspection franchise. Think you guys gained about 500 basis points of market share, and I think now you guys are almost like 14x larger than your nearest competitor, and this is versus a 7x last year. So, huge drop of your competitors. Is the bar just getting raised really that much higher with like your Gen 5 tools and your updated Gen 4 platform. And then how is the momentum shaping up this year for your Gen 5 platform?
Richard Wallace: So I'll take part and then let Bren get into the specifics. I think you're right. I think that what we're seeing is to continued investment by our customers and the flagship products both Gen 4 and Gen 4. And so one of the things I think a couple of generations we realized is we're going to keep investing in prior generation. So for example, the Gen 4 is how to build out two, in addition to what we're seeing at Gen 5. And I think for our customers it's the most effective way to manage their yield challenges and wrap their facilities. So we feel really good about where we are. We continue to invest strongly and as Bren will tell you, we're seeing the progress that we were hoping for in Gen 5.
Bren Higgins: Yes, this year's a good year for Gen 5 Harlan we expected to see multiple units adoption from all major customers, so encouraged by that. We'll probably end the year with somewhere around 30 units in the field. If I were to fast forward, obviously we need to execute over the next several months. But that's our expectation. So it's nice growth and adoption of that product line. And we introduced the next iteration on Gen 4 product is customers tried to extend that capability too. So you're seeing a mix and match adoption profile from our customers there. We also have a new product in the laser scanning space called Voyager. And that's the adoption has been really positive on that too. So you're seeing to mix and match across the Puma platform, plus Voyager. So for the total portfolio of optical pattern inspection, it's very well positioned in the market and we would expect as you see foundry move on to 5 nanometer down the road, including what they're doing today to support 7 nanometers activities, the logic investments that are happening. We feel pretty good about the position into that product line.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Nice job on the execution. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. John, your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. As always appreciate sort of the industry backdrop color you gave in your preamble. I'd be coming curious, especially with the inclusion of Orbotech, you gave us a lot of color around what happens to the total addressable market in calendar year 2019. I'll be curious as to how you see your SAM evolving in calendar year 2019 with all the puts and take?
Bren Higgins: Sure. I think that as we laid out early, Orbotech we think gives us access to another $2.5 billion in overall addressable market based on their position. We think that as we go forward to combine that with what we have in the rest of our business, we're at about $8 billion this year, and that should continue to grow. Basically, as we think about the products that are in the pipeline and things that we're working on, we think the TAM over the next few years grows, maybe another 10% beyond that $8 billion as we go forward based on new product entries and market growth. So we don't need a tremendous amount of market growth based on some of the new work that's going on and pipeline, both for KLA what was our process control business and now as we talk about our process business, which is in semiconductor and also FPD and PCB.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, Bren. Just going back to the gross margin, you said in the June quarter guide there sort of a one-time mix issue. Is that just more Orbotech revenue or just going on in the mix with the core KLA business. Then as we think about the full-year gross margin, is it pretty much a linear progression September, December to get to that number Or how are we thinking about exit trajectory of gross margin and what's driving the improvement? Is this overall mix of business? Or is it you actually getting your hands on the Orbotech asset and driving some cost synergies?
Bren Higgins: Yes, John, thanks for the question. So, consistent with the commentary around revenue growth, we expect gross margin to improve quarter-on-quarter as we progress through the year. So on the core KLA business we saw little bit more revenue in the June quarter. We'll see versus March and the mix of the business, particularly around reticle inspection where we've had some higher mixed mashup business and that's being offset by some fab business, which we're very happy with the penetration in performance there, but the margin profile is different. So we do see pretty wide swings around those products depending on what segment you're shipping into. So I do think that it's all kind of coming together into a lower profile in the June quarter, and we would expect to see it improve through the second half. I would say the same thing about the Orbotech business given the rapid growth there. And certainly, over time as we execute on synergies and we're doing a lot of planning today, but we would expect to see that sort of start to flow through the model certainly around supply chain, internal supply and other things. It will take a little bit of time for that to happen. So I think the trajectory moves that way. June is a little bit weaker with the tools that we ship or the tools that we shipped and how that profile plays out is how it influences the mix. But overtime, structurally, we feel pretty good about where the margin profile is overall on the KLA business and there's opportunities on the Orbotech side over time.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. C.J., your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Great, thank you. Thank you taking the question. I guess another question on gross margins, just wanted to clarify the 59.5% to 60.5% commentary. Was that for all of calendar 2019 or is that expected range for the back half 2019? And as part of that, could you walk through I guess the margin contributions across the three sub-segments within Orbotech, and if you can't be terribly precise perhaps rank order highest to lowest that would be very helpful? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Sure, CJ. So the guidance for the calendar year, obviously includes March and June, and then what we expect in the second half. So when you're thinking about the calendar year profile that's in the margin profile be to achieve that you need to see the margins improve in the second half. And I would say in the upper end of the range that I provided for the full calendar year. So hopefully that helps from a modeling perspective. On the Orbotech business, I think on the specialty semi side, the easiest way to think about the three businesses, is especially the semi side tends to be in the mid-50s plus or minus, you're probably in the high-40s on PCB and you're probably in the mid to high-30s generally on FPD. Now FPD piece has a lot to do with the business levels, given the leverage that in that model given the higher level cyclicality for that business. That's the smallest part of Orbotech, as you to think about the three businesses. So certainly over time, given the expectations of growth around the specialty side, we would expect to see the mix improve in terms of the gross margin profile.
C.J. Muse: That's very helpful. And as my follow up I guess at a higher level, can you talk through how you're partnering with Amichai and the rest of the Orbotech team to drive top line synergies and I think you guys so clearly see in both the specialty semi and PCB side, what kind of groups perhaps you've created and what the timeline is to start to see those revenue synergies hit the model? Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Sure. This is Rick. There are two things going at once. Orbotech was a successful company standalone for a number of years and has been successful in growing their business. So on the one hand, we've been very mindful of that as we began integration to let them to continue to work together as not quite separate, but continue to drive their business independently. However, over the last couple of months, we've seen customers actually ask us for to work together and we've seen some opportunities to do that. So that's really a slow roll out. We're going to detail this in quite a bit when we come in September for our Analyst Day, and we're going to talk more about it, but it is very encouraging especially in the specialty semiconductor where we do have customer overlap, no product overlap, the customer overlap looking for more capability. And I also think there are some customers that specialty semiconductor division was working on and the addition of KLA to the portfolio for them makes it more likely that we'll gain share and also market share there. So we think there's great opportunity. And the other business is maybe a little bit more of some cost synergies as we work through some of the operational opportunities we have there and then their supply chain, which kind of covers those two businesses also where will continue to drive that. But again, that's something we're going to lay out in more detail as we do our Analyst Day in September.
Bren Higgins: The other thing I'll add on that one is that, as you think about the PCB business and advanced printed circuit board technology is you are starting to see more blending between advanced packaging in PCB on the roadmap for our customers as they try to drive cost in capability improvements. And so, certainly, we have some exposure to that space, Orbotech does as well. So we're investigating what - how that strategy might play out and certainly how technology might be applicable as we start to think about the growth exists there. So early days on a lot of this work, but certainly something we'll outline in more detail when we get to the meeting in September.
C.J. Muse: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Krish, your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Bren, I don't know if I missed it, if you strip out the Orbotech revenues in March and June, is the core legacy KLA business growing? So is it like low-to-mid single, just want to get color on that, and I had a follow-up?
Bren Higgins: Yes, so in the prepared remarks, so against the guidance we gave in January, we guided for a midpoint on revenue of $920 million. We came in at $936 million. And then for the June quarter, we talked about shipments of approximately $1 billion. And also some comments around with 606, this transition to successfully expand that there isn't much difference between shipments and revenues. So hopefully that gives you the color. And again, it's consistent with what we thought in terms of March being a bottom and expecting to see growth in the June quarter and sequentially for the remainder of the calendar year. So, if you think about the broader performance of the business given the mix of WFE, yes, most of the decline is driven by DRAM, into a lesser extent, the decline in NAND. But you also have significant growth in foundry and logic. We're also seeing investments that are happening and reticle and in wafer. So, when you add all that together, our expectations is you see process control intensity improved in the year, but also that our relative performance relative to the industry should be better. So I think it's playing out the way we thought. And we're pleased with our market position and how we're seeing in the segments play out.
Krish Sankar: Got it. That's very helpful. Bren, and then a question for Rick. It looks like you guys are getting some traction in the EUV inspection side. EUV in theory is going to replace some of the multi-patterning steps. So if you look at it on the inspection side, is it fair to assume that EUV inspection will replace some of the regular inspections and net-net it's a neutral impact for you guys? Do you think there's actually growth did you inspection?
Richard Wallace: Process control intensity goes up with EUV. That's clear. And it does so because of the additional requirements associated with the reticle inspection is going to just the stakes are higher with those reticles. And I also think you're going to see more focus on print call. So you're going to have more optical inspection as well. Not to mention some of the challenges, we're going to have with overlay when they get to multi-pattern. And so I think there is good reason to believe that we'll see intensity go up over time. Now, when you think about how much of the market is really EUV at this time, it's a pretty small number. So that percentage is going to take some time to accumulate but it's definitely increase intensity.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham and Company. You're line is now open.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Thank you for taking the question. Wanted to first ask on the memory side of the business. Sounds like DRAM is weak as well 3D NAND in your June comments, I think you said memory increases to 47% of shipments from 38% of shipments. Just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color, what's going on there? And then my follow-up question is on the bare wafer inspection segment. It looks like Gartner's reporting that segment increased something like 87% in 2018. How do you see that part of the business in 2019? Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Yes, on the shipment profile, the shipments to memory customers are higher in the June quarter. There's a couple of big projects that we expect to ship to both in the DRAM and the flash side. So I think in terms of the second half of the year, we'll see how that plays out and we'd expect increasing momentum as we move through the year, but we do have higher shipment levels to both segments of memory in the quarter related principally to two or three projects. On the bare wafer side, we've seen a lot of growth in that business. I mean, 2018 was a great year and 2019 was flat to 2018. And it's not just the bare wafer customers as much as it's also on pattern inspection and metrology overall, which has been driven by the high levels of memory investment. So, you have capacity requirements, but you also had changing specifications for metrology and the cleanliness requirements for 3D NAND is driving a lot of investment in that product. So we would expect similar results in calendar 2019 versus calendar 2018 in that business against the backdrop of the declines in the WFE market. Now as we move to 2020, I would expect some of that capacity on the wafer side too - those that demand on the wafer side to pull back a bid calendar 2020 still much higher sustaining level given the requirements I talked about. But we would expect for this year and to be very consistent with what we saw last year.
Quinn Bolton: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line as to shear off Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Toshiya, your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Yes, great. Thanks for taking the question. You guys provided long-term growth expectations for Orbotech when you guys announced the deal. I think it was 15% for semiconductor devices, 13% for display and 8% for PCB. Have those numbers changed at all given the developments over the past 12 months?
Richard Wallace: Yes. So we put those numbers are very consistent with the year 2020 model that tech had presented probably back in 2017. So look the assumptions move around, certainly these lay assumptions move around, I would say I'm probably more optimistic on the semiconductor side and a little less. So on the display side. But overall, the expectations for that business, which 2020 model I believe was $1.25 billion. I feel pretty good about that at least today based on the path that we see to get there. Obviously, the size of these markets and how the electronics market and markets play out will influence that. But we haven't seen anything at a top level that, that we think this way this from that view that, they should be able to achieve the 2020 plan that we laid out when we announce the transaction.
Toshiya Hari: Okay, great. And Bren as a quick follow-up on synergies is $50 million over the next six quarters still the right way to think about synergies from Orbotech? And I guess related to that, what sort of OpEx synergies are embedded in your June and back half guidance of $370 million to $375 million? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Yes, very little is embedded. We targeted a time frame of 12 to 24 months. We're doing that work now, I think just given the timing of how those actions could play out and how you see it flow out of the model, it'd probably be - we start to see some benefit towards the very tail end of the year. So limited synergies are forecasted in the guidance again, both for OpEx and for top line. So - but our goal is $50 million, by the $50 million run rate by the end of 12 to 24 months from the transaction and we feel pretty comfortable with the ability to get there. We'll see how it plays out, I would say, it's probably more $20 million to $25 million in OpEx and maybe $25 million to $30 million in the COGS volumes.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thanks for the color.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Deutsche Bank. Patrick, your line is now open.
Shek Ming Ho: Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in your comments regarding China, you said the industry spending to be down, however, with the memory market in China going through some significant yield issues. Could you see KLA outperforming, I guess that outlook based on increasing process control intensity to help them along their development curve?
Richard Wallace: Yes, both things are true. We do see overall market coming down as we said memory down, China maybe a little less. And we're continue to be strong as we help them in terms of some of their aspirations about driving these new processes. So yes, we do see intensity higher there we should outgrow in China.
Shek Ming Ho: Great. Maybe as my follow-up question on the EUV inspection side of things, you've talked about the limited availability to date, primarily on the foundry logic side of things, how do you see the memory market, particularly DRAM in terms of its adoption and how it could influence your EUV inspection bias?
Richard Wallace: There is some adoption there. I would say it's from our perspective, we're going to be engaged if that happens. I think like everyone, they're going to look at the cost benefit of doing that versus the alternatives probably most pronounced via formation. So I think that we're going to see the opportunities there as they come. But I would say it's much more limited in memory then relative to logic or foundry.
Shek Ming Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Atif, your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Thank you for taking my questions. Rick, since you start to move to 7-nanometer, 6, 5, 5.5 just seems like there are just a smaller and smaller increments in terms of the shrinkage. Can you just talk about within there like $10 billion to $11 billion kind of CapEx outlook are you expecting your sales to grow as a leading foundries move in smaller steps?
Richard Wallace: We do. Before I want to correct something I just said, it's the storage note on DRAM, that's something that, not the VF formation. In terms of increasing intensity for the foundries, absolutely, I think the challenge for the foundries is yield at these advanced nodes. And as you know, as you push these the stress on EUV increases in terms of - or the economic viability. So we're going to see process control intensity throughout really the supply chain, whether it's in - you have to make the reticles and that's a challenging prospect now and maybe the most challenging. So between reticle formation and the print down onto the wafer to make sure you have clean images. I think that's a challenge to make sure that the defectivity is low. So we're seeing demand in the design sign to form these - the early tape-outs, and then we'll see it in production. So as the note scale, I think they're going to be largely driven on the economics of those nodes as it drives our customers.
Atif Malik: Okay. And then when we would at SPIE conference earlier this year, there was a discussion on stochastic defects. But the message here was that the chipmakers need help from every type of inspection equipment, whether it's e-beam or optical, just because these issues is far greater than anyone expected. Is your view on e-beam that it's still will be available as a combination to optical as part of your strategy. Is that still your strategy or you've had a changed strategy?
Richard Wallace: No real change. I mean, we've talked about leveraging e-beam platform to do some of the inspections on the reticle itself and that's a reticle without a pellicle just to validate the design. But when you do - when you print down and you're trying to model and manage the stochastic implications, you really need optical for that, because you need to have enough throughput to be able to cover enough area. So it's certainly going to be a blended approach by our customers and we are committed to having all the capabilities that they need
Atif Malik: Thanks
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions on queue. Mr. Ed Lockwood, you make continue for any closing remarks.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Jerome, and thank you all for joining us today. Jerome, you may conclude the call.
Operator: That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining KLA Corporation first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-01-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christine and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA Corporation Investor Relations. You may begin you conference.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31st, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: KLA reported excellent results for the December quarter, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each closing above the range of guidance in the period. The December quarter caps the third consecutive year of mid-teens revenue growth for KLA. The consistent, strong financial performance we are delivering is a result of our continued customer collaboration, product innovation and outstanding operational excellence. Our performance also highlights the strength and resilience of the KLA business model and the company's ability to consistently deliver long-term growth while delivering top-tier financial performance and strong cash returns to stockholders. Consistent with this vision and with an eye to the future, on January 10, we unveiled the new name and logo for KLA Corporation. Our new, more contemporary brand honors the legacy of KLA's past and reflects our vision of the future for employees and for partners. Now for some perspective on today's market dynamics. In terms of our view of the current WFE demand climate, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for a down year for the equipment investment in 2019, largely driven by meaningful declines in memory spend in both segments, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in advanced foundry and logic. However, notwithstanding the near term market headwinds currently impacting WFE investment, the long term growth dynamics for the industry remains strong, fueled by larger and more diversified semiconductor device end demand and disciplined market-driven capacity planning. The reduction in memory capacity investment we are seeing today is a result of weaker mobile demand and a pullback in data center. However, we expect supply and demand to rebalance over time given a more rational and disciplined capacity investment posture by customers. In contrast to memory, leading edge foundry and logic investments have begun to ramp and momentum is expected to continue in 2019, reasonably balanced through the year with customers investing to support transitions to advanced nodes and the insertion of EUV lithography. For KLA, we have already seen our mix of business shifting to logic and foundry and investment from these customers is expected to remain strong in 2019. Now for some highlights of our market leadership and product differentiation strategies. KLA continues to experience significant growth in demand for our wafer and mask inspection products driven by tighter wafer cleanliness and geometry specifications in the bare wafer market and the introduction of both EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops. We're also seeing strong customer acceptance of recently released new products, including the revolutionary new Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms. Both products are being adopted in volume at multiple customer sites, demonstrating that our long-term R&D investments and product strategies are meeting market requirements and enabling customers to progress their advanced technology road maps. KLA's service business also continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while generating strong cash flow. Service is expected to exceed $1 billion in calendar '19 and deliver long term annual revenue growth rates in the 9% to 11% range. Growth in services is tied to a number of factors, including expansion of the installed base and more end demand for legacy applications, driving higher utilization of capacity and extension of useful life. These are just a couple of examples of how our strategies for technology and market leadership are delivering results. As we move ahead in the new year, we remain focused on advancing our long-term strategies, positioning the company for success and continuing to deliver strong financial performance and long-term stockholder value. To conclude before handing the call over to Bren, I'd like to give a quick update on the status of the Orbotech transaction. KLA and Orbotech are continuing to work cooperatively on approval of our transaction with the Chinese antitrust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and we're finalizing discussions with them. We expect to receive China regulatory approval this quarter. Given the timeliness and sensitivity of these discussions, we will forgo any further discussions and will not answer additional questions regarding the transaction until we have new developments to discuss. This concludes my comments for today. Now I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance in the quarter. Revenue was $1.12 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.44 in the December quarter. In today's press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now for highlights on the December demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were a record $1.09 billion, above the range of guidance for the quarter. The upside to our shipping guidance was a result of pull-ins of approximately $65 million of deliveries originally scheduled for the March quarter. As a result of these pull-ins, the shipment results for the second half of calendar '18 were essentially flat with the first half. Our outlook for March quarter shipments is in the range of $860 million to $940 million, with the quarterly sequential decline in shipments a function of these pull-ins into the December quarter as well as the shift in delivery dates from two memory customers that occurred very late in December. Though visibility in the industry today is challenging and customer plans remain fluid, particularly in memory, our current view is for the second half 2019 shipments to be greater than the first half, a result of the factors I just discussed and our latest customer delivery expectations for 2019. Memory was 61% of semiconductor shipments in December. DRAM accounted for 38% of system shipments. We expect memory to be approximately 40% of shipments in the March quarter. Foundry was 24% of shipments in the December quarter and is forecasted to be about 50% of the total in March. Logic shipments were 15% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 10% of shipments in March. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 28%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 21%, and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%. I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.12 billion in December and $50 million above the midpoint of guidance. We expect March revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $960 million. March revenue levels are lower than we expected back in October. As highlighted in our recent earnings reports, the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition means that quarterly revenue levels are now more closely tied to quarterly shipments. Due to this dynamic, the shipment pull-ins we experienced in December have led to meaningful revenue upside in the quarter but at the expense of the March quarter. This coupled with the memory shipment delays I mentioned earlier, are lowering our revenue expectations for March. Due to our record shipment backlog and expectations for system shipment scheduling for the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the March quarter will be the low point and anticipate sequential revenue growth to resume in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of calendar year '19. Gross margin was 63.6% in December, 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance as the modest improvement in product mix was offset by slightly higher manufacturing and service costs. In March, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%, principally due to volume as manufacturing costs are spread across a lower revenue base. Product mix expectations are roughly consistent with the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $275 million in December and at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 39.1%. For the March quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $278 million at the midpoint, with variability around this level driven principally by the timing of program development costs. Looking forward, our customers' technology road maps represent an opportunity for served market expansion for process control and market share opportunities for KLA. Our operating expense investment levels for 2019 are geared to meet the needs of this expanding market for our products and technology. We are making significant investments to support EUV adoption, increasing metrology and inspection challenges in memory and data analytics and design-based capabilities to ensure customers are able to get increasing value from our products. We are optimistic about these growth prospects and plan to invest accordingly. The effective tax rate was 11.4%. Given the new corporate tax structure in the U.S. and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, we are adjusting our long-term planning rate down 1% to 14%. At this point, we expect this rate to remain at 14%, inclusive of Orbotech after close of the transaction. Finally, net income for the quarter was $372 million, and we had 152.6 million fully diluted weighted shares outstanding. Now for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.7 billion, cash from operations was $282 million and free cash flow was $256 million. Capital expenditures for 2018 were higher than our historical run rate of around $50 million to $60 million per year due to the expansion of production facilities to support future growth as well as investment to support our new, R&D-focused facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I would expect CapEx levels to remain elevated in calendar '19 as we continue to make investments in these areas. For calendar year '18, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 30%. In the December quarter, we baked an aggregate of $115 million in regular and quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $250 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization with just over $400 million remaining as of the close of the quarter. We expect to complete this program over the next couple of quarters consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional $1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA in the December quarter reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control on our customers' growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model. Given these factors and coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the anticipated Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA is uniquely positioned to continue to deliver long-term value to stockholders. After three strong years of memory investment, 2019 will be a year of digestion for this segment of the industry. Customers continue to press their technology road maps, but their capacity planning remains fluid. For KLA, we expect that given our technology leadership, coupled with expected growth in the foundry and logic segments and along with our exposure to broader opportunities in the wafer and reticle markets, we are well positioned to outperform the industry in 2019. With that, to summarize, guidance for the March quarter is: shipments in the range of $860 million to $940 million; revenue between $880 million and $960 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.35 to $1.67 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.39 to $1.71 per share. We plan to update guidance inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition shortly after completion of the transaction later this quarter. Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to notify investors that we have decided to shift our 2019 New York Investor Day from the original planned date in March to later in the calendar year. We will update you on the new timing at a later date. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Theodore Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead, sir.
Timothy Arcuri: So Bren, I'm trying to sort of noodle through the pull-in and noodle through the impact of that. So if I adjust for the pull-in, the shipments were like $2.15 billion in the back half of 2018. And then if I adjust for that pull-in, the shipments would be like $965 million roughly at the midpoint for March. You said before that the first half shipments would be up versus the back half. So for it to even be flat, that would imply that June shipments would have to be like $1.18 billion or something like that. So they'd have to be up a lot versus March. So I'm just wondering, have those two memory push-outs, do they push out beyond June such that the June shipments would not be $1.18 billion so that it would be what you said it was before?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim. So I think on your math, look, we had $65 million of shipment pull-ins into December quarter. So based on that guidance, yes, just that effect alone would move the number from $900 million to $965 million. The push-outs are pretty significant in terms of two major projects. So I would say one pushed out further than the first half of the year. The other one, we'll see. I think that there are a number of projects where timing might be in the middle of the year. So we'll have to see where it ultimately lands. But clearly, it had a effect on our view. First half now, I would expect to be down versus the second half of '18. And then we would see a recovery in the second half of '19. So down somewhere in and around 10% plus or minus is how I'm modeling it today, but we'll see how it plays out.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Got it. And then if I look back at the revenue, if I just take the midpoint of the revenue guidance, something like $920 million. And I look back at what you did when you were at $920 million in the past, margin was about 200 basis points higher than what you're guiding it. So can you maybe give a little information why is margin so low? Is it just mix? And do you get that back in June and throughout the rest of the year?
Bren Higgins: So Tim, I mean, we were obviously sizing the company. And as you can see our output from December in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range. So the decline in the second half of the year and then that carrying forward here through the first quarter is that we're taking basically a factory that's sized to ship a much higher level and spreading those costs across a smaller revenue base. So the volume impact of that is pushing gross margins down, and that's really the only change from a quarter-to-quarter basis as you look at the different moving parts within margin. So I would expect as we start to see revenue pickup given the guidance we said of sequential revenue growth through the rest of the calendar year, we'll start to see some incremental gross margin improvement there. And based on the guidance that we were giving in terms of outperform relative to the industry based on where consensus WFE estimates likely are, we probably see gross margins somewhere in and around, I would say, 63%, plus or minus 50 basis points as I'm modeling the year. We'll have to see how some of the mix dynamics play through. But obviously, we're in a much lower revenue level today. And with the industry contracting than what we saw in calendar '18, and that will have effect on our gross margin in the near term.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ada for John. Can you discuss if you're seeing any changes in domestic China at this point?
Bren Higgins: Well, the domestic China is a little weaker versus the last call where we were thinking that shipments looked about flat for the indigenous projects year-to-year. As we look at that today, it's probably somewhere in the 10% to 15% lower. We'll see. Obviously, visibility in the second half is not so great at this point. But if I look at the shipment profile of what we shipped in '18, what we expect to ship in '19, it's about 10% to 15% lower, most of it around memory.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And can you talk about the implementation of EUV in DRAM and logic foundry and if you're seeing any changes to the adoption cadence given kind of the slow adoption of leading-edge nodes that's being discussed right now?
Richard Wallace: No real change. This is Rick. In terms of the rate of adoption, we see continued piloting in early development with an intent to ramp. And we're participating in that through some of the development work we do and also in the mask shop some of our demand has been driven by that. But no real change in the cadence of what we've seen in the past.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Your line is open. From Cowen, your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Steve calling in behalf of Krish. The first one I wanted to ask about was on your bare wafer inspection tool business. Just given how strong that business has been performing for a while now and just given some of the moderation in wafer starts in the semi industry, how should we think about the trajectory of that business across the rest of this year?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So this is Bren. So that business continues to show very strong momentum. You have to keep in mind that there are a number of things that are happening there. First of all, there was a long period of time without any investment really at all. So there's a change in the capacity requirements there that customers have been investing in. That, coupled with spec changes, have driven not just the inspection tools, but also need for the metrology tools. So we've seen that business perform very well through '18 and would expect as we look at '19 not much change from that business. So I would expect to see it carry forward. And based on communications so far with customers, I don't have any reason to change that assessment.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it. And as for my follow-up, wanted to ask about the relative trend or profile of foundry and logic demand across this year. Is that going to be more first half weighted followed by a moderation in the back half when, I assume, memory picks up the demand profile or do you also see foundry and logic relatively steady across the year? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: In some of the prepared remarks, we talked about it being reasonably balanced across the halves. So I think second half could be a little bit larger, but generally pretty reasonably balanced for both logic and foundry as you add the two segments together.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir.
C.J. Muse: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the deferred revenue side, it was a nice uptick for September, but looks like very modest impact here in December. So I guess first question, do you think that the volatility associated with deferred revenues is now behind us?
Bren Higgins: Yes, C.J., I think it is. It wasn't that big of an issue for us. But certainly, we're seeing revenue much closer to shipment as you saw from the results in the December quarter and the guidance for March. And if you look in the 10-Q filing, you see the reconciliation between 605 and 606, effectively the same results quarter-to-quarter. So there was the timing issues that played out. But at the end of the day, I think the right way to think about the business and model it given that these are really timing dynamics is pretty much the shipment number will be the revenue number with some variation related to new products. Now we do ship more new products maybe than some of the peers and so that can have an effect or certain regions where you may have to go all the way to customer acceptance. But generally, the numbers are going to be pretty close together.
C.J. Muse: Okay. That's very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, as you think about the progression of EUV and thinking specifically to foundry, can you speak to what's driving the demand here, 7-nanometer versus 5-nanometer and how you see the revenue kind of progression through calendar '19 and into calendar '20?
Richard Wallace: I'm sorry, C.J., what's driving the demand from the device standpoint or for us?
C.J. Muse: I'm trying to understand your demand side, both from a more modest pilot line 7-nanometer plus activity this year, ramping more aggressively to 5 next year.
Richard Wallace: Yes, sure. It's pretty straightforward actually. Most of the demand early in the 7-nanometer comes out of the mask shop because that's where people are qual-ing new mask sets and driving a lot of utilization of new capability in the mask shop. And also in the development phases of trying to get those devices to work. And then it'll shift toward production and it will drive more in line kind of applications, both inspection and also some of the metrology needs as we ramp. But right now, what we're experiencing is mainly in the mask shop and the development.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead, sir.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe, Rick, as a follow-up to C.J.'s EUV question. From your delivery perspective, has everything generally remained on track or do you see any potential pull-ins or push-outs in terms of the timing of delivery of your reticle inspection tools?
Richard Wallace: No, nothing has delayed. If anything, throughout calendar '18, we saw accelerated demand in support of a larger number of starts than we would have forecast for a year ago in terms of advanced design. So far more tapeouts of advanced designs, both for EUV, but also just advanced 7-nanometer without EUV. So we're seeing the demand on both of those. We don't have an EUV-specific tool in the market. We have tools that can cover both. So we're pretty well situated to support it either way. But that's been strong and particularly in the foundry logic area.
Patrick Ho: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as a follow-up question in the DRAM market. We've seen how, I think, in the past you've talked about an increase in metrology usage with 3D NAND. As the DRAM industry goes to 1Y and eventually to 1Z and with increases in patterning steps, how do you see the mix of an increase in process control intensity? Is it going to be more biased towards your inspection tools because of the patterning steps or are you also seeing more metrology applications come online as the DRAM industry migrates down these next few nodes?
Richard Wallace: Yes. Some of both, but for sure, the DRAM will push inspection, high-level inspection sensitivity because they're more sensitive than, say, a NAND flash would be towards advanced inspection capability for smaller defects. So definitely, DRAM is going to push it in terms of things like our Gen 5. Metrology, both of metrology more so I think the flatness and cleanliness on wafers for NAND has been a driver we've talked about in the past. So it then moves when you got a DRAM back to overlay constraint. So it really depends. Fortunately, for us, there are different problems that kind of push different parts of the portfolio depending on where they are in the cycle.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead, sir.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe focusing on products. On your flagship Gen 5 PWI inspection system, can you guys just true us up here? I know the team was anticipating 17 to 18 systems in the field exiting last year. Did you guys hit that target? And more importantly, sort of given the ramp of EUV, the early work on 5 and 7-nanometer logic, one alpha node for DRAM, what are your thoughts around growth of Gen 5 this calendar year?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Harlan, it's Bren. So thanks for the question. So yes, we did hit our target. Expectations were very consistent or results were consistent with expectations for that product. And as we move into next year, we're still seeing a steady cadence of investment here. Most of the tools are development-focused. We're introducing the second iteration of the product line that provides more, a better cost of ownership for customers, slightly better throughput and also has some new features with data analytics, computational capability, design-based capabilities and so on. So it is moving along pretty well, should be deployed. We'll start to see it crossover. I don't know exactly what the crossover percent will look like in '19. But as you start to think about 5-nanometer ramps, you'll start to see more Gen 5 deployed in production.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Okay. Good to see the momentum there. And then can you guys just give us an update on your multicolumn e-beam inspector system for sub 7-nanometer mask inspection? Last time you gave us an update, which was about a year ago, I think the team was on track to introduce systems this calendar year, calendar year '19. Can we get an update and any early metrics on performance, throughput or customer feedback?
Richard Wallace: Customer interest remains high. We are now on a phase of this program where because we're engaged in developments with specific customers, we're not talking publicly about progress. But I can tell you there's a lot of interest, a lot of demand out there for capability as you've seen the increase in EUV capability and implementation. But we're not in a position right now to go through the specifics of where we're going based on the collaborations we have.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time, I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Christine, and thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chantal, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. You may begin you conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Chantal. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven’t seen the release, you can find it in our website. Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today’s earnings press release and in the Investor Presentation on KLA-Tencor’s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Ed, and thank you all for joining us today. KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding result in the September quarter, driven by the company’s technology and market leadership, and the compelling value of our diversified product and service portfolio in enabling customer success. The September quarter results also show the company is benefiting from our strategies for market leadership and revenue diversification. Furthermore, they demonstrate their critical nature of process control and enabling technology inflections in the semiconductor industry, including growth markets such as vertical NAND, EUV adoption and the China semiconductor industry. And with the expected closing this quarter of the Orbotech acquisition, KLA-Tencor will further extend its market reach in the electronics value chain, enhancing the company’s product and services portfolio beyond our core and WFE to address new growth markets where technological complexity is rising and where KLA can extend its core competencies into exciting new opportunities. Now for some perspective on the current industry demand environment, first, notwithstanding, the recent adjustments in capacity investment for memory customers and delays in logic spend from the second half of 2018 into 2019, we believe the long-term factors underpinning demand in the wafer fab equipment industry remain sound. This is the result of several key elements, including more diversified end markets for semiconductor. The ongoing commitment of customers to driving innovation and leading-edge technology roadmaps, disciplined market-driven capacity planning and the high levels of investment required to address increased design complexity and advanced device architectures. We expect these industry drivers will persist in delivering long-term growth and value creation opportunities for the company, the industry and for all our stakeholders. Moving now to the recent highlights that demonstrate successful execution of the company’s strategic focus on technology and market leadership, first, as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable growth of the semiconductor industry in China. Memory and foundry manufacturers in this region are investing in a high level to accelerate process development and yield learning. We expect momentum in China to continue in 2019 and beyond with customers progressing their technology roadmaps and ramping new production capacity in the initial phase of a multiyear investment cycle. Additionally, over the past several quarters, we have seen exceptional demand for bare waver and mask inspection products. Growth in our mask inspection business is consistent with planned increases in CapEx from the leading foundries as these customers ramp 7-nanometer capacity to support a high number of customer tapeouts at this node and begin aggressive development of 5-nanometer, including EUV development. In bare wafer, KLA’s market-leading inspection and metrology tools are key enablers of the growth in wafer supply to address capacity expansion in memory. These products are also essential in helping customers in all segments to meet more stringent design specification for wafer flatness and cleanliness. And finally, KLA-Tencor service business continues to be a highlight. Going forward, it is on a trajectory to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit annual revenue growth with low business volatility consistent with historical trends. Long-term growth and services is tied to expansion of the installed base, as well as from the increasing uptime requirements from current node production and at the trailing edge. Trailing edge fabs are currently running at near full utilization, creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades. In summary, before I turn the call over to Bren, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding performance in the September quarter, driven by the company’s strong execution and market leadership. Given our momentum in the marketplace, diversified growth markets and the critical role the company’s products and services play in enabling customer success, we are positioned for a strong finish in 2018. I’d now like to turn the call over to Bren for his review of the financial results. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, gross margin and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter. Revenue was $1.09 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.46. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings was a discrete tax benefit taken in the quarter related to new guidance affecting our adoption of the new tax law in the United States. As a reminder, since this is the first quarter of our new fiscal year 2019, our results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, all revenue commentary in our results and guidance exclusively reflect our adoption of the new standard and we do not plan to provide any color related to the financial results under the previous standard. In today’s press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now for highlights for the -- of the September demand environment in terms of shipments, total shipments were $1.007 billion, above the $975 million midpoint and at the top-end of guidance for the quarter, driven by strength in memory and an expected sequential increase in shipments to foundry customers. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in a range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, consistent with the update we provided in early September. Our current outlook is for shipments in the first half of calendar 2019 to be modestly higher compared with the second half of 2018. The shipment profile in the first half of 2019 is expected to show accelerating momentum from foundry customers driven by 7-nanometer design starts and 5-nanometer development activity, consistent investment from logic customers and a balanced mix in memory. Memory was 57% of shipments in September. DRAM accounted for 26% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory to be strong again in this quarter and approximately 64% of total shipments. Foundry was 38% of shipments in the September quarter and is forecasted to be about 22% of the total in December. Logic shipments were 5% of the total in Q3 and the current outlook is for logic to be 14% in December. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was, wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 27%, patterning includes shipments reticle inspection, service 22% and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%. I will turn now to the income statement. Revenue was $1.09 billion in September and finishing at the top-end of the range of guidance. We expect December revenue to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.11 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 65.2% and also at the top-end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving the strong gross margin performance in September were consistent with recent margin trends, with the upside largely driven by product mix. In December, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% as a slightly weaker product mix is offset by higher service and manufacturing efficiencies. Total operating expenses were $263 million in September, as non-headcount engineering program investments were lower than expected in the quarter due to timing issues related to prototype materials. We expect to incur those expenses in the December quarter, as we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $275 million at the midpoint, with variability around this operating expense level driven principally by the timing of these types of program development costs. Looking forward for the next several quarters, we are modeling quarterly operating expenses in the $270 million to $275 million range, based on planned program -- product development requirements and our current topline expectations. Operating margin in September was 41.1%. The effective tax rate was an 11.3% in the quarter and below the 15% long-term tax planning rate as business mix and further implementation of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in the U.S. impacted our rate. We will provide an update to the planning rate for the company inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition when we report results for the December quarter. Finally, net income for the quarter was $384 million and we ended the quarter with 156.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For the December quarter, you should model share count at approximately 153 million. I will turn now to highlight for the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.8 billion. Cash from operations was $381 million and free cash flow was $359 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $123 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully-vested restricted stock units and repurchased 300 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization and expect to complete this program over the next few quarters, consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional 1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. Finally, in regards to the adoption of ASC 606, please refer to our 10-Q filing for a detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition under the new and legacy standards. These differences are largely driven by timing of revenue recognition, principally due to and control the products’ transfers to the customer. Under ASC 606, we see reduction in the time period between shipment and revenue recognition compared to the previous standard. Based on the product and customer mix in our current shipment and revenue forecasts, we expect reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable for calendar ‘18 and in the range of 2.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The difference in revenue recognition between ASC 606 and the legacy standard could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but will narrow over a multiple quarter time horizon. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor in the September quarter reflect the company’s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer’s growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model. As the market leader in process control coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term value to stockholders. With that to summarize guidance for the December quarter is, shipments in the range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.88 per share to $2.20 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS at $2.02 per share to $2.34 per share. Before turning the call over for your questions, I’d like to announce we have scheduled an Investor Day for March 6, 2019 in New York City. Please circle that date on your calendars and keep an eye out for further details and a formal invite in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you all in New York. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we’d like to open the call up to your questions. We once again request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today’s call. Please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to give everyone a chance to rejoin today’s call as time permits. All right, Chantal, we are ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you much. Hi, guys. I had two. First of all, I am sure you saw the news today about the export restrictions to Jinhua, which is one of the three big memory fabs of course being built this was shipping to this year. So my first question is, does this sort of change how you think about your business next year, it seems to be a little more surgical than sort of likely to spread to be a big broad export restriction, but I am curious of your thoughts? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Hey, Tim. This is Rick and then Bren will follow. It does not change our view for the rest of 19 -- ‘18 or what we are looking at a ‘19 based on the expectation we had from that customer. To your point, it was a strategical export control, obviously, other things would change if that were broadened, but as it stands today it does not change our view.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. Tim, I think, as we look at this year, we feel pretty good about the tools that we have shipped there and closing on that business. There’s some de minimis levels of business in our ship plans over the next several quarters and into our forecast for next year for that side. But I don’t think it changes in a material way anyway of how we are really thinking about the business going forward.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then, Bren, service was up a lot, it was up 26% year-over-year, a big inflection. I guess, my question is, are you doing something different in service that caused a big inflection and can service grow that much year-over-year in December and then as you get in the first half of next year? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: No. Tim, that’s a result of our adoption of 606 and what is happening there and I provided some color in the last call on this topic for -- to provide a little bit of clarity and there will be more in the -- in our SEC disclosures that we will file in the next couple of days. But what we are doing here is that given the experience of our customers around our obligations in the first year warranty, is very similar to second year and third year contracts, as we are having to carve out of the tool purchase and defer the revenue associated with that first year obligation. Historically, with the cost accrual, so what happened is, we have reversed the cost accrual and then for the tools under warranty, we have added the deferred revenue, which we will take over the next 12 months effectively for all tools that were under warranty effective the transition date to 606 on June 30th. So it’s a unique dynamic that you saw with a pretty big inflection. I think the dynamics around our service business are consistent Rick talked about in terms of our views of growth rate going forward. But you will see this, this step up that will happen here and we will see it probably play out over the next couple of quarters and then it will level back out something consistent with what we saw historically. So, no changes in cash flow or business operations, but given the experience is fundamentally consistent with second year and third year contracts, the literature guides us this direction in terms of how we treat those obligations.
Timothy Arcuri: Awesome, guys. Thank you so much.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Bren, maybe to follow-up just on Tim’s question there, relative to your view that first half of ‘19 should be higher than second half of ‘18. If you could elaborate a little bit about what’s driving that views. How much of a benefit is 606. Is the expectation that the memory adjustments are now behind you or is -- are you still seeing memory uncertainty but logic and foundry has really given you that confidence, any color there would be helpful?
Bren Higgins: Hey. John, it’s Bren. So those were shipments’ statements, not revenue and I think it’s an important distinction here, because as we go through this transition, one anchor of continuity is the shipment metric, which is why we are continuing to provide not only actual results and context, but also guidance. So to be consistent with what we had said previously and to be consistent with this metric that is unchanging, our commentary reflects that. So as we move into this first half, I think, that the way the second half of this year has played out is very similar to the way we described in an update that we did back in September, where the September quarter came in a little bit stronger, December quarter sequential growth weaker and consistent with that guidance. So as we look at the first half of next year, we see an increase in the foundry and logic investment and we see memory in a relatively balanced profile as we move into the first half of the year. I would say that it is modest growth in terms of our expectations and we look at the build plan. But -- and I am not going to comment at this point of whether given where we are whether it’s March or June, but as we look at the first half given the timing and our conversations with customers, that’s how we are seeing the first half play out at least at this point in terms of shipments.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And maybe as my follow up just relative to all the consternation and concern about memory. It was interesting to hear you say that you believe memory shipments as a percent of overall shipments will grow sequentially in the December quarter. Rick, I wondering you just talk to what extent that that’s rising sort of intensity of what you do in the memory market versus just timing of projects, any help on sort of the rising intensity would be helpful?
Rick Wallace: It’s the intensity has stepped up but it’s more consistent with what we have seen over the last year. Remember we have other products that contribute to that too such as the bare wafer inspection products, which are leveraged to the memory overall wafer shipment. So those products have been extremely strong as the wafer demand around the world continues to get stretched and because of flatness requirements, we have seen an uptick in our business for flatness measurement. So I think it’s more related to those functions and that really has been playing out throughout this memory cycle where intensity has grown partly because of the strength of the wafer houses themselves.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, first one, just to follow up on China. It looks like you guys are not worried too much about the export control impacting your customer or at least your shipments to China so that’s kind of good to know. Is there a way to quantify either, I think, you had said in the past how indigenous China bookings are in the $600 million range for this year or as a percentage of sales like 25% of system sales was China. Is there a way to quantify what it was for the September quarter and then I had a follow up?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Krish, let me take the first part, and then, let Bren answer. We are not concerned about this particular movement in the market. So this one was a very strategic export control that that let’s just be clear on that.
Krish Sankar: Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. Krish, so shipments, 27% of shipments in the September quarter were China and that, I would say that most of that is indigenous China. There wasn’t a lot of activity with the multinationals there, probably, a little bit, but not a lot. And consistently, as we have looked at that indigenous business into this year and into next year, the range you talked about is about how we are seen it in terms of shipment at revenue levels $500 million to $600 million is more foundry centric, a little bit more foundry centric and material centric in 2018, it looks to be that way in 2019 as well, at least from an order perspective, but generally, we expect a continuation of momentum from those customers. And to the earlier point, I think, we feel, okay, I mean, strategically that this situation around export control tend to be confined to that one particular situation, and as we said earlier, we don’t think it has much effect on how we are running the business or planning for it into next year.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thank you very much. That’s very helpful. And then just as a follow up, your commentary on first half shipments and the fact that next year it would be more weighted towards foundry and logic. Is it fair to assume that, I mean, without any guidance like calendar ‘19 revenue should grow over calendar ‘18 and given it’s more weighted to foundry/logic. The margin profile or EPS should be better than sales. Is that a fair enough assumption?
Bren Higgins: So, I will make a couple of comments around ‘19 and the first is, we do expect foundry/logic to be up in ‘19 versus ‘18 and that we expect the first half to be modestly up from a shipment perspective versus ‘18 -- the second half of ‘18. So we will have more to say as we get to the end of this quarter and report results for the December quarter on the total year view. But at least that’s how we see it right now. You are right. Those segments are good segments for KLA in terms of process control intensity. Our margins are very consistent across our customer base. I don’t think it affects the margin profile or expectations from that business. But, certainly, that business were more exposed to in terms of the process control intensity of those wafer fab dollars. So we are encouraged by that. We will see how the broader industry plays out and have more to say about that as we move into December and in the first part of next year.
Krish Sankar: Thanks, Bren. Thanks, Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good Afternoon. Good job on the quarterly execution guys and strong free cash flow. Yes or no, talked about shipping 30 EUV systems next year, that’s up from about 18 this year. So the EUV adoption curve is here and it look like it’s a pretty aggressive ramp. You guys are supporting that with your mask inspection, blank inspection, CD overlay Gen 5, print check portfolios. So outside of yes or no, you guys are probably one of the bigger beneficiary, there is EUV ramps and given that ramp adoption next year, can you guys just quantify your EUV related opportunity next year and does this help the team sort of sustain that sort of 64% or 65% gross margin profile maybe into next year?
Rick Wallace: Hi, Harlan. It’s Rick. I will take the first part and then Bren will follow up. Let me start with -- we don’t break out our business by EUV in particular, but to your point there are a lot of drivers about EUV that are frankly good for KLA-Tencor and for helping our customers solve the related problems that they have with it. And as you mentioned, we are seeing good business and as we mentioned in the prepared remarks in our mask business due to the number of advanced starts that are going through fabs and there’s also support for print check as you mentioned with Gen 5 and also the overlay challenges that our customers face. So, it is a catalyst and a driver for us as we go forward, but we don’t break it out in particular and we are a little bit agnostic into how many tools there are per se next year. So our demand won’t really change if it’s the 30 tools they talked about or 20 tools. It’s really the driving of the new capability nodes that are driving our business. And, Bren, you can break up the second part.
Bren Higgins: So on gross margins, Harlan, I think, as we look at next year this and in my comments in the script, we see things operating generally around this level, product mix will drive us directionally here and there from quarter-to-quarter. But in and around this 64%-ish plus or minus 50 basis points looks like that’s how things are trending right now. Obviously, if we see expansion in the business, we should get leverage and that would work probably both directions if it turns out that the revenue were to come down. So, but in terms of the fundamental structural dynamics around margins that’s generally the right place to be.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on your Gen 5 pattern wafer inspection system, I think, you guys have said, anticipated 17 systems, 18 systems in the field by the end of this year, did you guys hit that target and how do you guys see the momentum of Gen 5 going into next year, just given the sharp ramp of EUV, the start of 5-nanometer EUV foundry and 7-nanometer EUV logic development activities?
Bren Higgins: Yes. Harlan, we did hit our target. So we are consistent with the numbers that we provided earlier and we would expect an increase into next year. I would expect revenue from Gen 5 into next year given the drivers that you mentioned that Rick elaborated on, we would expect an increase in Gen 5 revenue in ‘19 versus what we saw in ‘18.
Rick Wallace: And in terms of momentum, it’s playing out very much the same as prior generations when we got the new generations of inspection products or you have a couple of early adopters maybe one big early adopter that will drive it. Then you have customers that are maybe more evaluative of it and they will spend a lot of time trying to figure it out and then the momentum gets going when the customers who have not adopted realize the advantage that the leaders are having and then we see it kind of flow out. So when we model those, it’s not just the number of systems, it’s where they are located and the use cases. So we have -- some that are being utilized in the early stages of manufacturing support where others are in development. So we like the momentum of the product, we are finding unique capabilities. It is true that EUV creates more opportunities for that product to differentiate and for customers to rely on it. So we are feeling very good about how we are positioned as we go forward in 2019.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, you have mentioned the potential for first half ‘19 orders to slightly grow half over half. How sensitive is that to assumption of where memory prices will trend?
Bren Higgins: So my statement was around shipments, and not about orders, and I think, right now that the plans our customers have put in front of us given what we are seeing is it doesn’t seem to necessarily be pricing dependent, obviously, that does influence how they think about overall supply. But we have seen a number of adjustments already and how those have played out through ‘18 and those pushes into ‘19. So based on what we know today, our expectation is to see some balanced investment into the first half of ‘19 from a shipment perspective, and as I said, modestly up versus the second half of ‘18.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow up, just a question on inventories, they are higher than what we have seen historically. Can you give us some sense of what the range should for whether it’s days or dollars or what have you over the next several quarters? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: You are right. It’s a good question and they are higher. We have seen some increases related to some of our long lead time products that are in the queue, namely the reticle inspection products and we talked about some of the incremental demand that we are seeing for that tool and those are long lead times so we have to get in the queue to buy that those materials early. We have a number of new products that are coming out and so we are spinning up supply chain to support that in some cases you work -- we are working with newer suppliers and so, we are buying early to qualify parts to support a ramp. We have a new product launch in laser scanning, in E-beam. We talked about Gen 5 and the increments for Gen 5 into next year. So, all those things are driving the inventory levels higher. As we move over then that I would expect based on what we are seeing in terms of output expectations into next year that we will see that number flatten out and that will be -- that’s a -- as we start to put that material into tools and ship those tools out. So we are committing earlier and in those cases to make sure we have got the products in position so we can ramp them and that’s where we see in our financials is in the inventory build.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, back on deferred revenues. It looks like that ticked up from June to September by $300 plus million. So is that the kind of number we should be thinking about in terms of an increase for deferred in fiscal ‘19 versus fiscal ‘18? And as a second part to that, should we be thinking about deferred being isolated to certain long lead time or newer products and are there certain gross margins associated with those products vis-à-vis the rest of your mix?
Bren Higgins: Yeah. CJ, maybe this is something we need to reconcile with you, but deferred revenue, revenue backlog should come down. One thing about the 606 is, given the timing issues and given our implementation of 605, which was rules based and as a result took us longer to meet the conditions of transfer and customer acceptance, under 606 we get there much faster. So from the time we ship a tool till the time we revenue, it should only be about a month. So we should see deferred revenue related to that to come down. I talked a little bit about the warranty dynamic earlier, which will play out over the next few quarters. But there isn’t anything in particular that’s -- that special or unique about certain products is more really based on, if you ship a new product and it’s first of a kind of matching requirement things like that, that we have to go all the way to an acceptance on. But under 606 you go to that acceptance level and in a much faster way, and then all the follow-on tools are generally, you see revenue at shipment. As you know the installation acceptance process becomes or is considered more perfunctory from an accounting perspective. So that’s what’s happening and I would expect the deferred revenues to come down over time given those dynamics.
CJ Muse: Very helpful. And as a follow-up, as you think about just the Jinhua ruling from the Department of Commerce. How are you thinking if at all that could impact MOFCOM and their willingness to sign off on your acquisition of Orbotech?
Rick Wallace: We have not -- we have had dialog and discussions and we are proceeding along the path that we had modeled where we were in terms of regulatory in China. We feel very good about the exchange that we are having and we believe we are on track to close that out this calendar year, so as we have said at this quarter. So we feel good about that we have seen no indication of any change in their posture based on any of the other things that are going on relative to trade.
CJ Muse: Good to hear. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Rick, you called out at Foundry 5-nanometer as one of the potential drivers heading into first half of ‘19 and I realize it’s really early. But how do you think about that node in terms of contribution to your business over the next couple of years?
Rick Wallace: Well, I mean, I think, it will be a continuation of the expansion we have seen in terms of the newer products that we have are going to be targeted at 5-nanometer. We see the process control intensity challenges are very significant for our customers because that that’s the node in which EUV is going to be adopted in a greater percentage. Some people are looking at some level of EUV at 7, but 5 is really where it increases an adoption then will drive a lot of use. So we are well positioned for now. We are working closely with the customers that are pushing their technology and this is part of the Gen 5 discussion that we have had in the past where a Gen 5 is really more of a development tool, if you go back a year ago and now it’s becoming more of a pilot tool an early production in 5-nanometer becomes more biased toward production. So we feel great about where we are with that tool but also the supporting metrology tools as well.
Bren Higgins: In the first part of next year we will see the 7-nanometer tapeouts that are currently -- customers currently talking about we will see that drive up some activity, we are seeing in the mask shop, we will see it in the wafer fab as well and we will start to see more the n5 investments in early development as we move towards the second half of the year. As Rick said, it’s a challenging node, it’s a bigger node for EUV and we have got a number of products that are targeted for it. And I think, it will be interesting and intriguing business for us as we move into the second half of the year.
Toshiya Hari: Great. And then as a quick follow up, on bare wafer inspection, I think, this is another segment or product group rather that you guys have called out over the past couple, if not several quarters. I realize it’s a high margin business for you guys. I think some of your customers or all of your customers remain pretty constructive in the 2018, I am sorry, 2019 in terms of their outlook in terms of pricing, but some of them have toned it down a little bit, just given the weakness in memory and in certain parts of logic. How sustainable do you think this business is for you? I ask, because, in the past, I think, it’s been pretty volatile for you guys? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: We are certainly in a period where there’s both there’s kind of three things working at once in favor of this business, which is there’s capacity expansion, there’s technological challenges associated with these activity and there’s increased flatness requirements. So it is true that that has stepped up the level of business. So we are modeling as we go forward is, we don’t see that level of growth going forward again where we have essentially over the last few years that business has grown quite a bit. But the sustainability of the current levels is what we are modeling in terms of when we talk with our customers as they continue to bring on capability. And remember, the percent of their wafers that are going to leading-edge right now is relatively small and so over time they have to convert more of that to leading edge and so we will be feathering in our products and support of that. So we feel pretty good about the current level of business that we have in the bare wafer and its sustainability. We don’t see another leg up though as we saw in the last few years as we went to this node.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow up to your comments on the memory market lease in the near-term, when you are discussing about a balanced memory market, does that include the combination of DRAM and NAND or are you seeing one or the other potentially driving the first half of ‘19 outlook that you detailed?
Bren Higgins: So that’s the statement on our expectations for shipments into the first half. That it’s a relatively balanced shipment profile across the two segments. So I don’t really have much more to say than that. I think we feel pretty good. We have to remember one thing about KLA is that we tend to be more about enabling technology and less about just raw capacity expansion and so as long as our customers are continuing to push their roadmaps and they are in DRAM and they are pursuing you know incremental layers in NAND that we see and expect to see a continued level of business from those customers irrespective of the capacity adjustments that could happen.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. And we don’t just agree with the industry perspective that DRAM Investment in ‘19 will be coming down, we did see foundry up and so. But as Bren said it’s -- that’s not as much of the driver for us as the other factors he mentioned.
Patrick Ho: Great. That’s helpful. And maybe, Rick, as a follow up in terms of China and the indigenous market, particularly on the trailing edge foundry logic segment that’s been a surprising strength for the entire industry in 2018. From a process control intensity standpoint, do you believe the local semiconductor manufacturers on the foundry logic side are seeing the value and this will then continue as they continue to migrate down nodes in the future or I guess, I am a little surprised that there has been so much strength coming out of there given that they can reuse tool or buy used tools in the marketplace?
Rick Wallace: They have a -- there’s another process challenges I think that they are facing even though they have as you say that there -- they have the options that some of the bigger players might have tried to leverage. But it’s harder when you are relatively new and your scale isn’t as big to be able to do the reuse and some of the things that you have seen in the other places. So they are also tackling a number of technology challenges at once. We have excellent relationships there and we feel very good about the sustainability of that business. On a relative basis too, when you look at those fabs in terms of the scale they are significantly smaller, as I said, than what you’d see elsewhere. So, I think, it continues to be strong, I do think there’s even potential for more in the way of things like mash ups, where you will continuously strength. Ultimately they’d like to have wafer manufacturing, but I think that’s several years away before that would be a significant piece of that.
Bren Higgins: Well, they also are challenged to get used equipment, it’s a pretty tight market out there and we will sell at time you scale the equipment, we don’t really have in any of that in inventory. So what we have done is we have restarted older product lines to support some of that business or you are seeing current revenues or products that are de-configured to meet these trailing edge needs that certainly have the utility to be upgraded over time from those customers. So they are investing that way, and to Rick’s point, I mean, there are markets to ship into and eventually they will be able to get to a place where they can do that.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I want to get your thoughts on the use of EUV for DRAM, when you think it gets implemented on DRAM and how you guys could benefit from that?
Rick Wallace: Well, I think, that the, you are going to start seeing some adoption of it very much depends on the economics, I think, and that’s going to be the big challenge. But I think we are going to see some in 2019 beyond what we have seen in pilot in 2018. It’s really a similar story that to what we see in logic, where EUV presents opportunities both in terms of the mask shop, obviously, with DRAM, you don’t have the number of starts, but you do have very significant concerns about lifetime and contamination and EUV cleanliness overall. But I think it’s much more about the scalability and scaling of the design role in DRAM and also some of the challenges they are trying to get around in terms of overlay control. So it’s a driver, but not as much as it is, of course, than logic.
Atif Malik: Okay. And then on China in a nuclear winter scenario where, let’s say, there are broad restrictions put on equipment suppliers to ship equipment to China. Do you think this spending will just get absorbed elsewhere in Korea or Taiwan or in other fab infrastructure there to take the demand?
Rick Wallace: Boy that’s -- it’s hard to speculate on that. But I would think there’s clearly a case that China is investing for strategic reasons, and therefore, it’s more additive in some ways than if they were to not be allowed to invest. So, I think, you’d probably see some impact. We rate that probability as low and maybe also because of the action that was taken was very targeted and for specific reasons. So we are not modeling that as one of the outcomes. But, yes, I think, that that would have an overall impact on WFE for sure.
Ed Lockwood: Operator, we are ready for next question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the service revenue, want to make sure that, you talk about it takes a few quarters for the revenue recognition to formalize. So should we think about by the end of this fiscal year, you will get back to a longer term trend of, say, 9% to 10% year-over-year?
Bren Higgins: Yes.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. No. That’s a good way to think about it, because you are going to have to work through the deferred revenue associated with all the tools that were under warranty at the time of conversion. So there are some tools that are shipped right at the end of that quarter. So it will take a year for that to completely roll-off, although, it’s likely a little bit heavier in the front end than it is in the back half of the fiscal year. That’s a good way to think about it.
Sidney Ho: Okay. Great. My second question is that, in the past you have talked about trailing edge is now close to 40% of your revenues. Some of the foundries have you talked about overcapacity of 28 nanometers wafers and utilization may come down. Do you expect that to be a short-term phenomenon and do you expect next year you will see trailing edge going back to 40% of the revenues?
Rick Wallace: It looks pretty stable to us as we look at next year around as its more trailing edge that more of a foundry statement than an overall. But given the diversity of end markets around semis, if you look at those customers that are investing in the activity we are seeing. I’d see it being fairly stable. We will have to watch those markets and see. But at least at this point, that’s how it looks to us.
Bren Higgins: Part of what drives those, we have created options for those customers to upgrade their capability and so part of the business that we have for them even in a market where maybe they are not investing in new capacity is to upgrade their existing so they can get more efficient and we are seeing big demand for that and that was the initiative started a couple of years ago to be able to extend the value of the tools that are already in the installed base where we obviously have a home court advantage too.
Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Chantal. No further commentary from us today. Thank you all for joining. This concludes our conference call.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Lance and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood of KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Lance. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven’t seen the release, you can find it on our website. Today’s discussion of our financial results will be presented on our non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today’s earnings press release and in the Investor Relation presentation on KLA-Tencor’s Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you will also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter for KLA-Tencor with shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finishing at the upper end of guidance. KLA-Tencor delivered the second highest quarterly booking results in our history in the June quarter offsetting all-time records in quarterly shipments, revenue GAAP, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. I am also pleased to report that we ended the June quarter with a positive book-to-bill with record total backlog of almost $2 million. Also we are pleased to note our continued progress our timeline for closing the Orbotech acquisition in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. On July 12, the Orbotech shareholders approved the merger and to-date we have received all the necessary regulatory approvals with the exception of Korea and China, which we expect to obtain in due course. The record results and strong momentum KLA-Tencor is delivering today demonstrates the value of our market leadership and the critical nature of process control. They also highlight our market diversification and the benefits of our exposure to growth markets, such as EUV lithography, the early ramp of 7-nanometer devices in foundry, growth in bare wafer market to address capacity growth in memory in China to highlight a few. The overall, WFE industry environment continues to perform at a high level and we are excited about the prospects for continued strength in industry demand as we begin the second half of 2018 and look ahead to 2019. Our view is for WFE levels to grow in the mid single-digit range in 2018 aligned with the current consensus growth forecast for the year. Against this industry backdrop, our view for KLA-Tencor revenue growth is in the low double-digits for the calendar year. Now, let’s discuss some of the unique dynamics that are fueling our market leadership and diversified growth. First, we are experiencing near record levels of demand in mask inspection and registration fueled by customers’ investments in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography supporting 10 and 7-nanometer design tape-out. KLA-Tencor is working with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development and yield learning providing a complete portfolio of advanced mask inspection solutions. EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth for process control as it continues to enable linear scaling and presents market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address as the market leader in mask and wafer inspection as well as in films, CD and overlay metrology. Another example is in how over the past several quarters we have seen exceptional growth in demand for bare wafer inspection and metrology solutions driven by the expansion of bare wafer supply associated with a strong memory market as well as more stringent cleanliness and flatness requirements for bare wafers. In addition, IC, memory and logic customers are also experience – increased their investment in process tool qualification to limit yield excursions and to meet aggressive yield and capacity ramp goals. A third example of how KLA-Tencor is benefiting from our market diversification and technology leadership is seen in our strong results in China. Investment in China is the next major market inflection of WFE and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable development and growth of the China semiconductor industry. Our customers in China are investing with us in a high level to accelerate early process development and yield learning with our product portfolio as advanced process control solutions and our demonstrated ability to meet aggressive ramp schedules, KLA-Tencor business in China is operating at a high level and we expect it to remain strong for the foreseeable future. And finally, KLA-Tencor’s service business continues to be a highlight. Service is approaching $1 billion in annual revenue today and is expected to continue deliver consistent high single-digit annual revenue growth over the next several years. I will note that greater than 75% of service revenue is from service contracts to enable needed up-time of our systems demonstrating the value of the insight and technology these systems provide to enable customer success. Long-term growth in services is tied to growth in the installed base as well as from expanding investment and trailing edge fabs, which are running at full utilization in creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades. To sum up today’s results before I turn the call over to Bren June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor demonstrating the company’s strong execution and fast growing industry environment. Given our market diversification and the record levels of demand we are experiencing in the marketplace, 2018 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for KLA-Tencor and we are encouraged by the early signs of continuing momentum we are seeing for 2019. I will now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick and good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue, shipments and earnings per share once again achieving record levels. These results were driven by strong demand across our major product markets as well as the solid execution of our strategic objectives. Revenue was $1.070 billion in the June quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were both $2.22. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now, turning to highlights of the June demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.07 billion, about $20 million above the midpoint of guidance and finishing into top end of the guidance range for the quarter driven by strength in memory. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be down almost 10% at the midpoint and be in the range of $935 million or $1.015 billion. Our current expectation is for shipment growth in the second half of calendar ‘18 to be flat to up low single-digits compared with the first half with sequential quarterly growth resuming in the December quarter. While second half shipments will be stronger than the first half, this half to half growth expectation is modestly lower than our expectations from 3 months ago given the widely reported memory push-outs in slowing logic investment. Our shipment mix in the second half of the year has continued strong customer pull from our memory customers, including those in China, ramping bare wafer products and expected pickup in foundry logic shipments in the second half of the year. Memory was 69% of shipments and in line with our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 28% of total system shipments in the period. For September, we expect memory shipments to be approximately 59% of the total. Foundry was 22% of shipments in the June quarter and foundry is forecasted to be about 36% of shipments in Q3 driven by increases in EUV investment and 7-nanometer design starts. Logic was 9% of shipments and our current outlook is for logic to be approximately 5% of total system shipments this quarter. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments, patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for our metrology businesses and for reticle inspection; service was 21%; and non-semi was approximately 3%. Revenue was a record $1.070 billion in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect September revenue to be flat into midpoint and be in the range of $1.030 to $1.110 billion for the quarter. Revenue in the second half of calendar ‘18 is expected to grow in the mid single-digits compared with first half, aligned with our current outlook for revenue growth in the low double-digits in the calendar year. Gross margins were 64.8% at the upper end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance in June were consistent with recent margin trends for the efforts largely driven by product mix. Looking forward to September, we expect gross margins to again be in the range of 64% to 65% as improving service margins offset slightly weaker product system mix. Total operating expenses were $265 million in June and operating margin was 40%. We continue to see many opportunities for top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and advanced memory applications to name three important examples. For the September quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $270 million with variability around its operating expense level driven principally by the timing of non-headcount engineering program development costs. For the full year in calendar ‘18, we expect operating margins to be in the 39% range, solidly above the targeted 38% plus margin level in our published business model for these revenue levels and demonstrating KLA-Tencor’s leading market position and business execution. Free cash flow margin is currently forecasted to be in the upper 20th percentile in 2018, ranking KLA-Tencor among the top tier companies in our industry. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter in line with our guidance and our long-term tax planning rate. Finally, net income for the June quarter was a record $348 million and we had 156.8 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Turning briefly to highlights of the June quarter balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at almost $2.9 billion. Cash from operations was strong at $374 million and free cash flow was $351 million. In the quarter, we retired $225 million of outstanding debt on our revolving credit facility, paid in aggregate of $117 in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $38 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. At the end of the June quarter, we had just under $1 million authorized under our share repurchase program. Legal restrictions related to the timing of shareholder approval of the Orbotech transaction limited our repurchase activity in Q2, but we plan to resume repurchases in the September quarter targeting quarterly repurchase volumes consistent with our previously articulated approach, an expected 12 to 18 month timeframe subject to market conditions. We have an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorized upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. Finally, I will note that we will adopt a new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our 2019 fiscal year. We are adopting ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. Also throughout FY ‘19 which ends on June 30, 2019, we will provide a quarterly reconciliation of reported revenue as well as what revenue would have been under the old reporting standards in order to help investors quantify the impact of differences in revenue recognition under the old and new standards. We do not foresee any impact to cash flows or business operations from the adoption of ASC 606. However, adoption of ASC 606 will impact reported revenue. Here is the summary of two primary changes to revenue recognition resulting from the adoption of ASC 606. First, instead of accruing the cost of 1-year warranties for systems that we sell to our customers, we will allocate revenue to the warranty element of each transaction and recognized the revenue over the warranty period since we will provide preventative maintenance as well as repair services during the warranty period in a manner consistent with our normal service contracts. Second, we will continue to recognize systems revenue at the point of time where we have satisfied our performance obligations and transfer control of the product to a customer. The determination of satisfaction and performance obligations is based on several factors, including the transfer of title, physical possession of the tool by the customer, customer acceptance of the product and whether customer acceptance is considered a formality based on history of acceptance of consumer products. We expect that the new standard will generally allow for earlier timing of revenue recognition and circumstances were to deem that sufficient performance indicators have been satisfied to conclude that control has been transferred to the customer. We are still assessing the overall impact to revenue from adoption of the new standard. As I mentioned in the detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition between the old and new standards will be provided on a quarterly basis, beginning with the reporting of the results for the September quarter. Going forward, quarterly guidance including the guidance for the September quarter will only be provided based on the new rules. We will report actual revenue under both sets of rules for every quarter in fiscal ‘19 and our Form 10-Q. Although there are future factors in terms of shipment, timing and customer acceptance of products, including packed results under both standards, based on current shipment and revenue forecast, we expect the difference in reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable in calendar ‘18 and in the range of 1% plus or minus 50 basis points higher when compared with the old standard. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor’s June quarter reflects the company’s technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer’s growth strategies and the value of our industry leading business model. The semiconductor and semi-equipment industry environment today is strong, healthy and performing at a high level with multiple growth fueled by demand from exciting new applications such as artificial intelligence, big data, increasing semiconductor automotive content and the Internet of Things layered on top of investment in China in the traditional computing and mobility markets. As the market leader in process control and with our revenue diversification within the labor fab equipment market, coupled with the new opportunities for growth in market expansion presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and it continues to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Looking forward to the second half of 2018 and beyond fueled by record total backlog at the end of the June quarter and growth in revenue in the second half of the year, we are positioned for another year of solid growth in 2018 and look forward to more of the same in 2019. With that, our guidance for the September quarter is shipments in the range of $935 million to $1.015 billion, revenue between $1.030 billion and $1.110 billion and GAAP diluted EPS $2 to 2.32 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 to $2.36 per share. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we would like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today’s call. Please feel free to re-queue for any additional questions you may have and we will do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today’s call as time permits. Alright, Lance, we are ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks very much. Bren, I guess the first question is it looks like you lost maybe $50 million in shipments for the entirety of the second half, almost all of which was in the third calendar quarter. So I guess my question is with this all memory and the inevitable question is going to be why should everyone trust that September quarter is going to be the bottom of what is – what you see to basically catalyze Q4 being better? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim. So, it’s pretty well chronicled about some of the push-outs that we have seen over the last month or so, and that’s an industry statement. Yes, it was mostly memory. There was some impact in some other segments as well, but most of it is memory. Based on what we see in our build plans, we see a pretty strong snapback into the December quarter and all indications here at this point given our conversations with customers with all customers is that that’s the case. So, we are pretty confident about it. I think it’s our customers behaving rationally in terms of how they are managing capacity and we would expect it to come back in Q4.
Timothy Arcuri: Awesome, thanks. And then just as my follow-up question, you guys almost always are at or above the high-end of the earnings range. So, if I assume that, that’s going to happen again in the third quarter that would put you at basically $950 million to $960 million in annualized earnings, so the stock will be trading at roughly 10.5x to 11x earnings. So I would think that you are chomping at the bit to basically buyback your stock at these levels. So, can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for repo and what the cadence might be once you are able to do that? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: So, we authorized $1 billion, which I covered this in the prepared remarks, we authorized $1 billion and then another $1 billion contingent on the closing of the Orbotech acquisition and a timeframe for execution over the next 12 to 18 months. So, we were able to do that for legal reasons in the June quarter and we would expect that we plan to begin doing that in a much more aggressive way beginning this quarter. So, we tend to be very principled focus in terms of how we think about the execution of this in the principle that ultimately drives how we think about deploying the cash flows of the company. So we plan to do that in a systematic way, although we do have flexibility to be opportunistic as we move over the next 12 months, but we expect to step up our posture and we will increase it even further after we close the Orbotech acquisition.
Timothy Arcuri: Awesome, Bren. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution guys. On the significantly better sustainability of your business relative to others in the equipment market, you guys have always talked about your business as being more tied to the rate of new technology migration versus capacity addition, I think your EUV mask inspection platform is a good example of that, Gen-5 is a good example of that. And it seems that technology migration cadence continues to be strong across all segments of the market, is that at a high level how we should think about the sustainability of your business here in the second half relative to what your peers are seeing out there that are probably more a little bit more capacity focused?
Rick Wallace: Hey, Harlan, it’s Rick. I think that’s right, there is a couple factors. One, we do have a more diversified set of customers as opposed to being pure-play and so we have got a number of elements if you think about mask manufacturing, but also wafer manufacturing has been an important segment for us and that has capacity and technology built into it as customers push the sensitivity requirements and flatness requirements of our wafer manufacturers that drives the business cycle there, reticles for new tape-outs for EUV, you talked about Gen-5, there is also – it’s also true in metrology products. So, it’s a broad base of customers all advancing technologies both memory and logic and we also have of course the activities that are going on in China, so pretty broad and we feel good about the diversification of the customer base at this point.
Harlan Sur: Thanks for the insights there. And the other thing that you guys have talked about and I am wondering again how much does this add to a pretty strong second half demand profile is that you guys have talked about strong new product pipeline right, which in some cases is expanding your SAM opportunity like the Voyager platform. Did you guys just recently introduced for pulsatile developed inspection. You also introduced your Surfscan SP7 tool. Here you guys got 90% market share like how is the new product cadence and in some cases the SAM expansion helping the momentum here in the second half and into next year?
Rick Wallace: Well, we have always been a product company, Harlan. So we do need this innovation and does two things. One, it enables our customers to move their technology forward. It also makes it very challenging from a competitive standpoint for people to keep up with us given the rate of introduction and investment in new capability. And as you point out, we are bringing out new platforms that will have the new addressable markets in addition to the ones that you mentioned with Voyager and SP7, their other products in the pipeline. So, it gives us a lot of confidence as we finish off calendar ‘18 and go into ‘19 and beyond that we are well-positioned not just to continue to perform across all sectors, but also drive additional growth through the additional expansion of our available markets.
Bren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it’s Bren. The other thing I would add is that it helps to offset some of the impact that bringing us, when you bring new capability to market, customers want to try to use that capability and so there is – that becomes pretty attractive to them. It also brings favorable economics with each generation. So even if they don’t need the capability, there is a cost of ownership improvement that comes with new generations of products. So, even if they don’t need the capability, they tend to – there is an economic motive as well. So to Rick’s point, it’s important for our competitive positioning to maintain the cadence that’s far ahead of what our competitors are doing, but it also provides an opportunity for customers to leverage the capability and for us to offset the impact of some of those kinds of things.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question with the adoption of ASC 606, can you still manage your business to a 6-month backlog that’s always been a core part of offering great visibility etcetera. So, curious what the ramifications are of this change in accounting standard?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I know it’s a good question, C.J. I think around the 6-month backlog in terms of orders to shipment, you will see us continue to manage within that window. I’d ideally like to have that down closer to 5 versus 6. Where we will see the impact of 606 is that you will see revenue come to the P&L sooner, the standards around qualifying for revenue from a shipment perspective, you will have more shipments effectively becoming revenue sooner. So, where we will have with the consolidated customer base you have more – potentially more volatility in the revenue number. We increased the range a little bit as a result of potentially that factor, because it does reduce the daylight between shipments and revenue. But for our business, it should stay relatively consistent I talked to some of the principle changes in the prepared remarks, but in terms of how we manage lead times from order to shipment that part of our business won’t change.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up typically I guess in terms of new capacity as you guys outperformed and so as we look at your second half outperformance for the guide, is that indicative of capacity adds that we should start to see layering it and starting Q4, Q1, Q2, is that a majority of it or is it more leverage to mask and wafer inspection where the full industry won’t benefit from that, anyway to sort of help us understand the moving parts there?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So, there are a lot of moving parts, meaning you are right, I mean, reticle and wafer will have those businesses are ramping and so that will have an impact into the first part of the year. The shipments into China, I don’t expect that to abate. That’s been fairly consistent obviously big projects which seems like over the course of this year we have had our project to quarter pretty much. So we will see how that plays out as you move into the next phases there. We are seeing foundry logics start to come back in the second half profile and that – and if you look at the order mix that I think is a pretty good harbinger for what we expect to see into the first part of next year in terms of the bigger contribution from those segments. So I think that I wish I can give you more, but it is a bit of an all of the above answer, but clearly, there are aspects to Rick’s point earlier of the ramp around wafer and mask that is a bit unique to K-T.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question and Bren, thanks for the color on the September shipments. I just had a question it looks like your memory numbers in calendar Q3 are in line with your peers you are seeing a nice snapback in foundry. Can you just tell us, give us some color on what’s driving those foundry shipments, is it one customer or is it across multiple customers and along the same path in December, the snapback you are seeing in memory is it driven by DRAM or NAND? And I just had a follow-up after that.
Rick Wallace: So on the foundry side, it’s – I mean we are seeing foundry logic both come back and so you got multiple customers investing there, but certainly on the foundry side of one customer is investing more than others. On the – I am just taking a quick look here, so in September we would expect it to be slightly weighted to DRAM of the memory mix.
Krish Sankar: Got it. And then as a follow-up question, I just wanted to find out is there a way – can you guys say how much of your total sales is exposed to EUV at this point, is there a way to quantify that and also the bare wafer inspection business has been pretty strong for a couple of quarters, how sustainable do you think this is? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: We don’t really quantified around the EUV participation, but I would say it’s on the order of 5% to 10% depending on how you look at it. And certainly there is development work that’s going on, that will scale. We do think the process control intensity around EUV is similar to what process control intensity is for non-EUV which means as EUV costs go up for scanners the process control will scale with that, so that it is definitely consistent trend.
Bren Higgins: And Chris what was the second part of your question?
Krish Sankar: The sustainability of the bare wafer inspection business?
Bren Higgins: To the Rick’s comments in the prepared remarks, I mean we are seeing significant investment there both being driven by the strong memory environment. You have got increasing flatness specs. You have got cleanliness specs that are driving investments from the IC manufacturers. To support all that you have the wafer manufacturers also investing. So they have to deliver wafers. They have under invested for a number of years and so you are seeing new investment there against new specs. So I would expect those numbers to continue to be strong as we move certainly through this year and through next year as well. And as long as there is significant investment in memory from a WFE perspective, we are going to see that business participate pretty strongly.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Rick. Thanks Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Toshiya Hari: Yes, great. Thank you so much. Fundamentals in the flat panel display industry have certainly deteriorated since you announced the Orbotech deal, so Rick I wanted to ask if your view on that part of the industry has changed long-term?
Rick Wallace: Well, we always said it’s through cycle mentality looking at the businesses that Orbotech was in, that hasn’t changed. And we are not really in a position to talk about their business yet, but in terms of the strategic nature of that deal we feel very good about the original thesis and all the subsequent work we have done so far with that team. We are very excited about putting the two together and obviously we will have a lot more to say once we finished the regulatory process.
Toshiya Hari: Understood. And then secondly Bren you talked a little bit about service margins improving in the September quarter and that to some extent offsetting the decline in margins on the products side, can you elaborate on that point and talk to sustainability and service margins? Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Sure. I mean there were minor changes there. I mean one of the good things we are seeing in China in-service now that we have invested pretty significantly in China to add resources to support all of that business both to be able to ramp those fabs and then support them over time. And as you know they are geographically pretty dispersed. So between the field resources, but also infrastructure to support all that activity we have been investing pretty significantly over the last 12 months to 18 months. We are now slowly completing that and so we are starting to see the incremental margins flow through on service. So I would expect one good thing about the consolidated customer base is we are able to get to leverage service infrastructures certainly in certain places like in China or not well maybe the investments in China, but in Korea or in Taiwan we are able to try to leverage those resources. So it’s a good story and I would expect to see service continued to be well. Obviously, it’s dilutive to our overall gross margins but the incremental offsets some of that ongoing dilution. But we believe the operating margin profile of business is certainly strong and accretive to the overall company.
Toshiya Hari: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at your shipment by geography, Korea was really strong this past fiscal year, I am just trying to better understand, would you be able to quantitatively help me understand the mix maybe perhaps between memory and bare wafer?
Rick Wallace: Almost of it is memory in Korea. I mean there is a little bare wafer, but most of it is memory.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, helpful. And then looking forward there are a couple of new fabs coming online Greenfield fabs and I am trying to assess how I should think about your new product and a scaling should we expect your revenue to or a percentage of your system revenue as a percentage of WFE finally to hit 10% plus as your design wins are scale especially for 3D NAND and two of these new fabs for 90 plus layer 3D NAND manufacturing and would that give you the opportunity to see a material increase in memory especially NAND?
Rick Wallace: So we have been pretty pleased with the process control intensity improvement that we have seen in flash and so it’s been a good sign. I would expect that the new products if we can continue so our customer problems will continue to see some momentum there. It’s still about half of that what we see in foundry logic. So the intensity for lots of reasons is lower, but we are seeing incremental improvement. We have seen more metrology. We have new metrology products specifically targeted let’s say should help with that. So as we move forward with the increase in foundry logic mix, we would expect into next year really having an all time low this year. We would also expect that to influence the overall process control in terms of the percent of wafer, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in 3D NAND and if we can continue to execute hopefully there is more there for us.
Bren Higgins: So Mehdi just to build on that, the challenge has not been available problems to solve, the challenge has been solutions which solve those problems and it’s not a competitive challenge for us, it’s just the feasibility, so it’s taken some time to work and collaborate with those customers to get new technologies to market really to address the verticalization of NAND. And we have very strong products in the pipeline addressing that. So we think calendar ‘19 we will see continued success with those initial penetrations and that will be the basis for driving additional percent of WFE out of memory.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. So one way or another it should move higher, right now it’s like 7% to 8% of WFE, it should move higher as…?
Bren Higgins: Correct.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the guiding in tough environment. Two questions on China, Rick my understanding is that the three key domestic Chinese product lines are almost done this year and the emphasis is to improve the yield, given your position in inspection market, can you just update us where the yield stand with those domestic projects and then what your expectations are for the volume business to come from those projects. And then as a follow-up, if you can also talk about tariffs and implications from tariffs on your supply chain or your business?
Rick Wallace: Sure. The exciting thing is we have great partnerships with our customers in China looking at ramping retail facilities. And as you might imagine there is a lot of interest in our expertise and capability there, so we are partnered very closely and we have had a lot of executive exchanges as well as others. So we feel very good about our ability to support their new fabs in their ramp. I won’t get into the specific of the yields, but they are making progress. We are seeing the promise of additional investment based on the initial success that they are seeing and we feel very good about our position and enabling that as they go forward. And of course in this case it’s really across the product portfolio. In terms of the implications of tariffs, our supply chain isn’t based in China, so from a standpoint of our key components we are not really subject to that, obviously we have an eye out for other changes that could be coming. But as of this point, it does not have any impact on our business.
Bren Higgins: And then Atif just in terms of the investment profile. I mean as we – just thinking about from an order perspective and there is a little bit more lead time to these orders because in a lot of cases, they are building new facilities. But we have seen remarkable stability. If you just go back in the last couple of years and even as we look forward of the business levels we are seeing in China. So this year we should book somewhere in the neighborhood and I said this before somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600 million or so from indigenous China and I would expect that level of investment to continue and we will see as start gating out, little ways of away from what things will look like as we move into ‘19 but all indications at this point give me confidence that we are going to continue to see this level of investment for these players as we move forward.
Atif Malik: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mr. John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
John Pitzer: Good afternoon, Rick. Thanks for letting me asking questions. Congratulations on solid results. I think you guys talked about in your prepared comments the September shipments from logic being down around 5%, which I think is the second lowest and kind of our dataset at least. I am kind of curious as you think about the December recovery, is logic kind of helping bolster that view of a recovery in December, is it still just mostly memory?
Bren Higgins: Hi, John. Bren here too. Yes, John, you are right I mean September is fairly weak, so we do see some bounce back in that segment. We also see bounce back in foundry. So, we do see the shifting profile of 40%ish or so of the shipment mix going to foundry logic into the second half of the year. So, yes, it looks like it’s going to bounce back, it looks like there is some sustainability to it into the first part of next year.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And then Rick it’s nice to see that despite the fact that WFE is mixing slightly more towards memory this year than last year, but you guys are still significantly outgrowing WFE. I am curious to what extent do you think that’s just better leveraged to memory versus kind of EUV playing out this year and you talked about kind of the process intensity of NAND, how should we think about 1Y and 1Z on the DRAM front?
Rick Wallace: So, I think the part that’s maybe a little misunderstood and we need to do a better job explaining it is things like the wafer manufacturer is there is high capital intensity of inspection and metrology for those and they are really feeding the memory guys. So, it’s probably the case that our intensity around memory is higher than the way it’s traditionally thought of. So, we are seeing a lot of benefit in the demands that are placed on wafers as they moved to new technologies in memory, because of the cleanliness and also the flatness. So that’s actually been a boost. And as you point out on the EUV factor is still there and then lastly we would say the process control intensity in China has been supportive of the overall business environment for us as we have great positions there and in their early stages of trying to ramp new facilities. So I think all of those factors have come together to give us a very nice 2018 and what looks like a very strong 2019.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Edwin Mok from Needham. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: Hi, great job guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First question on the foundry side, you mentioned that there is improvement on foundry shipments from September to December, if I calculate correctly second half is actually really strong versus first half, is it all driven by 7-nanometer or are you seeing that demand year-over-year and then just kind of tied to [indiscernible], should we expect a much higher level of Gen-5 adoption in 5-nanometer versus 7, can you kind of talk about the Gen-5 progress?
Rick Wallace: I think there is couple of ways to think about it. It’s early for 5, but EUV activity drives a lot of the business in the mouse shop. And so we are seeing the benefit from that in terms of our business in mask is doing quite well. Also wafer manufacturers are very supportive of bringing in new capabilities. So we are seeing that as a driver. And then you do see Gen-5 and you see actually some of the metrology tools too in support of the new nodes, so I think it’s really a combination of those factors that gives us the diversification of reach across to the customers and is really driving the general outperform.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think the other thing that’s happening is as you are seeing an increase in 7-nanometer tape-outs moving through the foundries and so a) that’s driving certain reticle capability, not just writers, but then inspectors from us, but we would expect to follow-on capacity additions to support that business. As we move into ‘19 you start to see some of that investment around 5-nanometer development. Certainly, Gen-5 plays a bigger role in that. I would expect that business to grow next year versus this year just driven by some of these dynamics.
Edwin Mok: Great. That was extremely helpful. And then just a question on the OpEx and maybe I guess operating leverage on the model, Bren, do you think you can sustain OpEx at this level, it seems like December you can grow quite a bit and it sounds like you guys upbeat at least in the first half of ‘19, do you think you can maintain OpEx at this level or just grow OpEx, can you talk about that?
Bren Higgins: Yes. I would think the OpEx is going to trend in line with the model that we published. So we are operating about 50 to 100 basis points above that model for these revenue levels given the commentary we provided around next year, it sort of fits within that. So I would see the OpEx scaling a little bit in line with the models we have published. We try to drive incremental margins, certainly greater than 40% target, 40% to 50% on our incremental margins. So there is a number of new programs we are investing in, new platforms supporting EUV, supporting extra metrology. So, in addition to a couple of things that we just recently announced and there is follow-on activity around those. So I would expect us to continue to invest. We are going to deliver to the model we have been public with and we are going to continue to try to drive leverage through. But given the level of business we are seeing, I feel pretty good about the sustainability of our investment profile.
Edwin Mok: Great. Thank you.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. And Rick, I appreciate the color you have given on some of the increasing capital intensity trends on the memory side. Maybe as a follow-up to John’s question earlier about DRAM and the 1X and 1Y, you talked about the cleanliness and some of the issues there. As the DRAM ministry moves to 1Y and you see a lot more of these multi-patterning steps and even some of the process change where they could come, I guess more logic like, is that also helping to increase the process control intensity given that they are more logic like and obviously those – that that’s been your key bread-and-butter for the years?
Rick Wallace: Well, certainly, we are seeing interest and some adoption of Gen-5 in the DRAM guys as they look at 1Y. So absolutely we are seeing that. And that wasn’t necessarily originally anticipated the degree with which we have seen that strength, but it just – it kind of goes to the point of the desire to get more capability in there and the fact that the coverage matters quite a bit. So we have just placed some interest that people have had at e-beam for those applications with Gen-5. So we feel very good about that. And we are definitely getting indications that there is more to come there. It’s not just that, it’s also registration, so if you think about DRAM and the challenges it has for registration we see more adoption there as well. So we feel very good about the trends that we are seeing in memory as well.
Bren Higgins: So Patrick we are encouraged – we are trying to be a little more conservative in terms of how we model it just given the historic behavior from these customers what we deliver, believe we can deliver any capability here around some of these problems as that’s an opportunity for us. Most of the context that provide around performance and intensity levels is based on little improvement there, so if we can drive improvement in process control intensity that’s an opportunity for us to deliver incremental upside sort of the base model about how we are running the business over the next few years.
Patrick Ho: Right. And Bren, maybe as my follow-up question in terms of services, you talked about 75% of your revenues are coming from I guess the service contract today, but unlike process tools which in many cases can eke themselves up and it just becomes a kind of recurring revenue stream of replacing parts. Can you give a little color of the type of value-added solution or some of the product enhancement that process control can offer and how that can grow?
Bren Higgins: Well, I mean certainly the contract profile that you got it pretty well, where there is a limited number of these tools, they are very important to keep them up and customers want to contract structure to ensure that the uptime and availability is there. And so the 75% certain level of contract as a percent of the total has been fairly consistent at that level. So, we feel very good about the sustainability of that over time as they stretch the installed base. We are continuing to look for opportunities to sell incremental enhancements to the installed base. As you know that there is a lot of trailing edge activity that’s happening to support automotive and IoT, they are running those older fabs and the installed base much harder. So, there is incremental demand for those customers to not only drive higher uptime for their tools, which is driving the business, but also to buy enhancements to the current installed base and those fabs are full, so it’s not like in some cases you can move in extra tools, you are going to add incremental capability to the existing school, whether it’s speed or increased sensitivity. So, we are pursuing and looking at those opportunities and given that the stratification of demand for semi, it creates an interesting opportunity for us going forward.
Rick Wallace: And maybe a very significant difference between process control, service business and process business, is the availability of alternative suppliers for consumables. So if you are in a process company, you have that threat of outside sources providing consumables, process control, we have a very strong position to enable and make this equipment continue to perform as is designed and that’s really a big part of the value proposition. So they are different businesses.
Patrick Ho: Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my questions. Your largest foundry customer in Taiwan talked about improving manufacturing efficiencies. From your experience with them, do their CapEx cut impacting all the equivalent types equally or do you think that will impact you guys less because process control is more front-end loaded. And clearly your guidance for September quarter is very good do you think it is more than offset by their spending on 7 nanometers in EUV?
Rick Wallace: Well, I think there is two sides of it. One, we like to believe we enable better capital efficiency by helping customers get more value out of the rest of their tools. On the other hand, of course, every customer is trying to manage all their costs and work across the products to extend and reuse. And as Bren said, one of the keys to our success is to continually bring out new products and new capabilities as a counter. What you have clearly got to show is continued improvement and cost of ownership performance, which means more capability. So, I think the answer is kind of both. I think you definitely see a push from all of our customers to enhance their sustainability of their investment and by doing that drive efficiency and we enabled that and we also try to support it by driving new capabilities.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great. My follow-up question is related to China, can you talk about your shipment strength in China this quarter, this June quarter. About a year ago, you talked about China as the region has the potential of SAM for process control for about $5 billion between 2017 and 2020, given your comment that Chinese manufacturers seems to have high process control intensity, do you think that estimate is higher, lower is just about the same?
Rick Wallace: I think it’s too early to say. I mean we have seen in the same time we have seen some softening in the forecast for the sort of wafer outs in China. So I don’t know that we could speculate on that. We are pleased with the production that the support in the business that we have got in China, but I would say if they meet their published goals, then we will exceed that target. However, I think there are some definite challenges that they have got in terms of scaling those factories over time in the next couple of years.
Sidney Ho: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. One more on China, so shipments there were 32% of total versus 18% kind of level, were there anyone off and I think somewhere during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect China to stay around the $600 million contribution level next year, so kind of flat. I just wanted to confirm I heard that right?
Rick Wallace: You did. I mean, that’s an order level. And so what actually – how much actually shifts and revenues may deviate a bit, although we have been – things have been pretty consistent in and around that level. So that’s a reasonable number to use as you think moving forward. And if you look last quarter there was significant vertical NAND project that we ship to this quarter, there is a significant DRAM project, it’s not all the business, but certainly a big part of it.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then on the services side, is there a backlog number we should keep in mind or I guess often a different way, if we assume that WFE is conceptually flat next year, can you still grow your services business at a double-digit base?
Rick Wallace: I mean, the way the service business generally works is you have booking shipments in the same quarter. There is some extended warranty backlog, but it’s pretty minor. So there isn’t a backlog number, but it’s continuous in terms of the contracts that we signed and then we get the POs that are consistent with those contracts. But the other thing that contributes to it, if you think about the installed base and how long it lasts, one of the things driving, if you will, IoT or automotive is found to be utilizing longer, customers wanting more capability, wanting both enhancements and also those tools to run longer. So, the decay rate of what we would have originally modeled of tools coming off contract is slower and that’s how you can drive growth even in a flat systems shipment business, which we don’t think ours will be flat by the way even if WFE is flat, we are going to grow this year. So, we think there is still lot of energy left in the sustainability of the growth in services.
Vivek Arya: Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of the Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur: Yes, thanks for the follow-up. Given how far behind China is in terms of mainstream technology adoption, given that they do have a track record of higher process control intensity, have you guys seen any Gen-5 pull-ins from China, which may help them to accelerate the yield learning? And then just a quick follow-up in terms of keeping the product pipeline healthy, can you just give us an update on the multi-column e-beam EUV reticle inspection platform, is that still on track for introduction next year?
Rick Wallace: Boy, those are our two very different questions, Harlan. So, in terms of the indigenous China projects, we have not seen demand yet for Gen-5 for those projects that we think that’s down the road for the guys that are doing memory, that’s something that certainly we could envision down the road once as you say. Right now, that’s not really their focus nor at this point is that their need we can satisfy with the number of the products that we already have. In terms of the multi-beam product, we continue to make investment, we continue to work through some of the technical hurdles and we have a lot of closed engagements with our customers on that and there is clearly a lot of customer interest, but I won’t go beyond that at this point.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions. Presenters, I turn the call over back to you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Lance and thank you all for joining us today and your ongoing interest in the ownership of KLA-Tencor. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Ed. And thank you all for joining us. I plan to briefly cover three items in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick review of KLA-Tencor's outstanding results in the March quarter, followed by highlights of our very strong market performance in 2017 as reported by Gartner, and concluding with our updated growth outlook for the industry and for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2018. Let's begin with the March quarter highlights. I'm very happy to report another record quarter for KLA-Tencor, with revenue topping $1 billion for the first time in March and finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $2.02. These results were driven by our ongoing focus on customer success and technology leadership and reflect the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace across each of our major product groups and in services. Also, on March 19 we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Orbotech, Limited. This acquisition is the next chapter in the progression of KLA-Tencor strategies for profitable growth and long-term value creation. With this combination, KLA-Tencor will be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions and services, extending our reach to address even more of the electronics value chain from semiconductor device manufacturing to packaging, printed circuit board and flat panel display manufacturing. We have kicked off the integration planning and regulatory review efforts, and these processes are moving forward as planned. We are very impressed with the Orbotech team and are excited about the opportunities that this combination will create as we execute our strategies to benefit customers, stockholders and employees. Coupled with the momentum we are experiencing in our core inspection and measurement business, and with the prospect of augmenting that growth with the new assets from Orbotech, we are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for KLA-Tencor. Turning now to highlights of the recently published Gartner market report for 2017. The data shows that in a very strong year for wafer fab equipment investment and with memory customers accounting for approximately 65% of overall WFE demand in 2017, KLA-Tencor grew or maintained a strong market position and drove SAM expansion in each of our major product markets, while addressing increasingly more complex inspection and measurement requirements in the marketplace. With WFE forecasted to remain at a high level in 2018, we expect overall process control intensity to grow in the year, driven by growing value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems and semiconductor industry expansion in China. As a leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to strengthen our position in China, both in terms of customer footprint and adoption. We are still on the early stages of a multiyear investment cycle in China which represents a tremendous opportunity for KLA-Tencor. The presence of subscale factories under tremendous pressure to yield while still in start-up mode and the overall complexity associated with developing a world-class semiconductor industry will drive significant growth for our business in the region. In addition, the high level of investment by memory customers has driven an unprecedented investment cycle in unpatterned wafer inspection and metrology to support capacity growth in wafer manufacturers and IC fabs, as well as to meet more stringent wafer cleanliness and wafer flatness specifications in vertical NAND. These products experienced record demand in 2017 with order momentum continuing in 2018 and with shipments and revenue expected to scale in this calendar year and into 2019. Now for some product highlights that underlie our strong market performance. First, we saw particular strength in mask inspection in 2017. Gartner estimates that the mask inspection market grew 64% in the year to $538 million, fueled in large part by customer investment in EUV lithography and by continued strength in multi-patterning optical lithography. KLA-Tencor's mask inspection technologies are critical to customer success in bringing EUV to market. We are collaborating with each of our major customers to accelerate EUV mask development, yield and requalification. Other process control challenges inherent to EUV include resist qualification and scanner control. These, along with the complex patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV source technology, present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive process control portfolio in the semiconductor industry. EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor. The overlay metrology market grew 29% in 2017 to $456 million. KLA-Tencor is a pioneer in overlay metrology, deploying unique capability across two different technology platforms. The growth of memory investment in 2017 was a major factor in the strength in overlay metrology and in other metrology markets for KLA-Tencor in the year, driven by the increased complexity in advanced memory design architecture, including multiple layers and film stacks and verticalization of structures. Finally, in optical pattern wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor's largest served market, the SAM grew 6% in the year to over $1.3 billion. And we experienced our strong market leadership driven by customer preference for our broadband plasma and laser scattering optical inspection portfolio over competing wafer inspection technologies including e-beam. These are just a few of the product successes that led to our sales growth and SAM expansion in 2017. This growth is a result of the continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address increasing inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive customer success in a period of strong growth for the semiconductor industry. Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2018. Coming off an exceptionally strong year in 2017, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today is solid, supporting a WFE industry growth outlook that is currently expected to be in the high-single digits to low-double digits in 2018. In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory once again comprising 70% or more of WFE investment in 2018, led by the ongoing ramp in 3D NAND, capacity expansion in DRAM and continued investment from China memory. In foundry, we are expecting to see orders for the first wave of investment in five nanometers to begin in the second half of the year, with logic investment in 2018 focused on 10 nanometer. And finally, we expect continued expansion of EUV lithography investment in foundry and DRAM in the year. Given our technology leadership, strong customer acceptance of new products, improving process control intensity and leading edge memory and our strength in China, KLA-Tencor is expecting to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2018. This does not include any contribution from the Orbotech acquisition which we expect to close by the end of the year. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented an outstanding period of financial performance for the company. Shipment, revenue, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter, with revenue and earnings per share finishing at record levels. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives. Revenue was $1.021 billion in the quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.95, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.02. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to highlights of the March demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.019 billion, finishing at the top end of the guided range for the quarter, with upside driven by higher-than-expected customer pull for our overlay metrology products. Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion. Based on our current build plans and expected customer delivery timing, we continue to expect second half shipments to grow in the mid-single digits compared to the first half of the calendar year. For the full year, we expect shipment growth in the high-single digits. Memory was 78% of shipments and stronger than our original forecast for the quarter. DRAM accounted for 47% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the June quarter with memory shipments forecasted to be approximately 68% of the total in Q2. Memory mix is expected to remain between 60% and 70% of shipments in the second half of 2018. Foundry was 13% of shipments in March, and foundry is forecasted to be about 24% of shipments in June. Logic was 9% of shipments in the March quarter, and our current outlook is for logic to be 8% of total systems shipments next quarter. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 45%; patterning was 29%, patterning includes shipments for reticle inspection; service was 22%; and non-semi was approximately 4%. I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.021 billion in March, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Service revenue was a contributor to the upside in the quarter as customer utilization at the installed base remains at a high level. We expect revenue to grow sequentially and be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.08 billion in the June quarter, and for revenue in the second half of calendar 2018 to be in accordance with our outlook for full year revenue growth of 10% or greater. Gross margin was 64%, in line with our guidance for the quarter. The factors driving our strong gross margin performance were consistent with recent margin trends in terms of product mix, efficient execution of new product introduction and variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations. Looking forward to June, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65% as a richer product mix is expected in the quarter. Our gross margin guidance of 63% to 64% in calendar 2018 remains unchanged, however, current trends support a bias towards the high end of this range. Total operating expenses were $261 million in March, down about $2 million compared with December, and operating margin was 38.5%. Operating expenses for the March quarter were approximately $5 million higher than guidance due to a number of factors, including higher material cost for next-generation programs. We continue to see many opportunities for future top line growth in our core business and plan to maintain our investment posture with new programs, including those supporting EUV and vertical memory applications. For the June quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $262 million to $264 million. In the second half of 2018, we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $265 million to $270 million per quarter, with variability around this operating expense level driven by the timing of non-head count engineering program development costs. Our outlook is for operating margin in 2018 to be in excess of 38.5%, consistent with our published business model in the $4.2 billion to $4.5 million annualized revenue range. The effective tax rate was 15% in the quarter, in line with our guidance and our long-term planning rate Finally, net income for the March quarter was a record $318 million and we had $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to highlights from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.89 billion, an increase of approximately $132 million compared with December. Cash from operations was $353 million in March and free cash flow was $338 million. In Q1, we paid an aggregate of $92 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $85 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. In February, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.75 per share. That's effective this quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had $1 billion authorized under our new share repurchase program, as well as authorization for an additional $1 billion contingent upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. We plan to resume share repurchases in the June quarter consistent with our previously articulated approach. We expect the amount of share repurchases in the June quarter will be limited given legal restrictions following the distribution of the proxy statement and prospectus in connection with the Orbotech shareholder vote on the merger. Our current plan is to accelerate our share repurchase activity following the completion of the shareholder vote subject to market conditions. Finally, I'll note that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, starting in the September quarter, to coincide with the start of our fiscal year 2019. We will be adopting ASC 606 using a modified retrospective approach in which we will report financial results prospectively under the new standard, but will not restate historical results. We will provide additional information on the impact of the new standard on KLA-Tencor's financial reporting in our next earnings call in July. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by the company in the March quarter and in the 2017 Gartner report reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' growth strategies, and the value of our industry-leading business model and capital allocation strategies. We are experiencing unprecedented growth in the electronics industry today, driven by new demand drivers such as artificial intelligence, big data, automotive and the Internet of Things layered on top of the traditional computing and mobility markets. This is a fundamental shift in demand for semiconductors. As the market leader in semiconductor process control and with the new opportunities presented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to benefit from this industry growth and to create long-term enduring value. Looking forward to 2018 and beyond, we are energized by what lies ahead. Fueled by record total backlog of just under $1.9 billion as of the end of the March quarter, we are positioned for revenue growth of 10% or more in the year against the backdrop of the overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow in the high-single digit to low-double digit range. With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is shipments in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.09 billion, revenue between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $2 to $2.24 per share, as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.02 to $2.26 per share. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call for questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have today's call. Feel free to re-queue for additional questions as time permits. All right, Jeff, we're ready for the first.
Operator: All right. Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much. Hi. Hi, guys. So the first question obviously is on memory. I don't ever remember you guys shipping 65%, 70%, which is basically in line with the market. I don't ever remember you guys having memory concentration that's sort of in line with the market. Typically it's quite a bit lower. So I guess my question is, is it like a one-time deal related to China? Is it a big uptick in memory process control intensity? Can you just talk about that? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Hey, Tim. I'll take it and then give it to Bren. Yes and yes. I mean, I think China definitely helps because of the greenfield fabs, which are always great for process control intensity, but also newer players needing to get the capability to ramp. The second part is that we have new capability which the market is recognizing the need for, and so we're seeing increased process control adoption as a result of that. And that's both in the developments in NAND, but also in DRAM as they continue to push design rules.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Hey, Tim. Welcome back. So I don't have much more to add. I mean, to Rick's point, I mean, China, we did ship pretty significantly into DRAM project in China. We're going to ship into a NAND project this quarter so we see a lot of momentum there. I think from a metrology perspective and inspection perspective, we're seeing some solid adoption in both segments, NAND a little bit stronger than DRAM from a process control intensity perspective. So we're really, I think, excited about our positioning there, and we've got some products in the pipeline that hopefully will help drive intensity further.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Bren, can you – I guess, just as a follow-up, can you talk about the timing on those products? I know sort of the industry's been waiting for a product that can really help ramp yields in 3D NAND. You guys have been developing that product suite for now sometime, can you talk about when that's going to really shift and when that's going to become meaningful in terms of revenue, and that could really drive the sort of organic memory process control intensity up for you? Thanks.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. And I mean on the inspection side, the inspection problem is proving – it's a difficult challenge for customers and proving to be a pretty challenging engineering problem. We've got some tools out in the field, we're working with customers in evaluation phase. We'll see if that translates into a high-volume production product or not. I think the jury is still out, but we're doing a lot of work on that front. And I think that's one area. I think on the other area is a product in metrology where we've shipped a couple of probe tools into the field for in-stack metrology and so we're hopeful we'll get some traction there. I don't think these products contribute to the financial results we've been discussing or the outlook over the next six to nine months. But certainly as we move into 2019, we'll see – hopefully we'll get some traction there and we'll see those will be a bigger percent of the total.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you so much.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our second question comes from the line of Mr. Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may go ahead.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarterly execution. We just got off the Intel call and they just pushed out their 10-nanometer ramp to the yield issues. We've also heard of yield challenges by some of your memory customers, especially on the DRAM side. You guys have always characterized your flagship Gen 5 wafer inspection platform as more of an opportunity as EUV starts to get more proliferation. But just given all of the current yield challenges in logic and memory, have you guys seen some pull-ins of the GEN 5 adoption into calendar 2018 by your customer base?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We have had good success with the GEN 5. I think we are still in the mode of proving out the capability before it ramps into production. We do have a couple of places where we're seeing multiple units ramping. But it is a relatively long cycle. We have seen the pull-in of product nodes. So in the case where we did think it'd be more tied to EUV, we've seen more work characterization of existing nodes kind of to the problems that you're talking about. I think people felt like maybe they'd resolved some of the yield challenges are definitely using some of their initial capability to debug. So we are seeing some opportunity for that. But it's still – it's kind of as we expected. It's a relatively long adoption cycle once people get in the evaluation. And most of the customers are encouraged but continuing to push that.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So Harlan, by the end of this year, we will have either shipped or booked for dollars somewhere near 18 to 20 systems into the field across all segments, and I think that's one of the things that we're encouraged by that we are solving issues in development across all segments with the customers around discovery use cases but also EUV use cases. So most of the roadmap for that product line right now is about how do you prepare for volume production for 5 nanometer and beyond. And most of the engineering effort on that tool is to speed up throughput and work through tunable sensitivity and some of the other opportunities to make it more production viable. So the traction is good. It's demonstrating value and it's demonstrating value across all segments which we're encouraged with.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then according to some of those recent market share statistics that you were talking about, Bren, your reticle inspection business grew by over 2x in 2017. Obviously, it's the highest profitability segment for you guys. Early EUV adoption, I think, was probably one of the strong drivers for the 2017 performance. But as we think about accelerated EUV adoption this year, do you guys think that the reticle inspection business can grow this year off of the strong results last year? First question. And then can you guys just give us an update on your next-generation EUV e-beam reticle inspection platform? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Let me take it. Maybe to view it from a portfolio perspective, we did see strength as you mentioned and we talked about in the prepared remarks due to a number of new tapeouts at advanced design rules and this, of course, being driven largely by people pushing designs and mask shock capability for EUV but not only that. Yes, we do see continued strength overall in support of EUV. And when we look at our overall process control intensity for EUV as compared to optical, if you look at the one scanner of optical Deep UV versus EUV, you need a similar percentage, maybe a little bit more percentage of process control intensity to support that. That includes the fractional use of reticle tools as well as wafer tools in order to support it. So while the overall industry in general may see capital intensity decline in areas other than litho, process control will track and maybe even outpace litho for process control intensity for EUV. So we're encouraged by that. In terms of e-beam, we're finding that there is a lot of appetite for the optical extensions that we have on the platform, and so we continue to support our customers with that. One of the nodes of the – the comments of the slipping out of nodes due to yield means they're also delaying advanced EUV insertion, which gives the optical a longer runway. So we feel very well-positioned to support that.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Hey, Harlan. This is Bren. The only thing I'll add to that is that we had talked about introducing that tool in the marketplace sometime in calendar 2019. Our views on that haven't changed. I would expect that it's more towards the end of 2019 than the first half. But our plans are moving forward and it's going to intersect the HVM at the right time. So nothing really new to add on that front since what we updated you with last quarter.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the great set of results. Rick, my first question is in regards to the foundry shipments. It's a two-part question, basically. First, when I look at the foundry shipments, they are pretty much at an all-time low. And I just want to ask how is the trajectory from here. It seems like even in the back half, it's not going up nearly to the level that you have seen historically. And second, as you talked about EUV, when I look at the EUV shipments that ASML is having in the foundry segment, it seems pretty strong recently but I don't see that reflected in the foundry shipments that you are having. So is there a difference in timing in terms of when the EUV ships and when you would actually start to benefit?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, I'll take it, but I'll also have Bren comment as well. In support of EUV, the question we're just addressing – we have seen reticle, so I think the reticle timing of that is maybe more consistent with the shipments of EUV tools and that is support of the same development work that's going on. We do expect to see an increase toward the end of the year in activity around the ordering for 5 nanometer node, and we talked about that in the prepared remarks. But I think that that is coming and that's something that we'll see later. And to your point, we had a great quarter but it wasn't really driven by our foundry business and we expect that to be late 2018 and carry over into 2019.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. I mean, to the point it's – we're performing, I think, at a pretty high level here with a lot of unique inflections that are driving our business absent the strong foundry of logic environment. And I think as we move through this year stays during memory centric, but beyond that we would expect foundry to coming a little bit stronger. To your point it's at the very low level, almost historical low level. But when you look at the comments we made earlier around China, you look at the EUV development activity, you look at the activity we see in the wafer space and then this improving process control relevance in and around the different memory segments, it's a good story for us this year and I think as we move into the future with stronger foundry environment then we'll see that kick in. And as you know, the process control intensity and foundry logic tends to be closer to 2x what it is in memory. So not every dollar of WFE is created equal when it comes to our business, and so certainly if you see a pickup in that segment so that's a significant positive for us.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. And then my second question is in regards to the mask inspection and broadly the strength that you saw last year. I wanted to understand how much of it is just driven by increasing mix towards ASICs. In cloud, we are seeing more and more companies moving to application-specific processes. So what I wanted to get a sense of is that as the foundry mix moves from low mix (31:55), which is a limited number of designs starting in the fab to a high mix in an environment where there are a lot more designs running in the fab, how does that affect your business? And secondly, as we think about the mask inspection business, the strong growth that you saw last year, was it a one-time phenomenon, or as the ASICs strength continues in the future, could this be a higher growth business for you?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, it certainly scales with the tapeouts, right? And you could even have a situation where you see reticle capacity put in place where you don't necessarily see it coincide with wafer starts because you have to do the tapeouts but maybe the volumes into the low-volume design. So clearly, we're seeing more activity there, certainly even at 7-nanometer. And so you're seeing more investment in and around reticles with a 7-nanometer width with the multi-patterning schemes that are being deployed. It does drive a need for reticle capacity around writers and inspectors, and if there's a nice ratio of one to two units to – or one inspector to every two to three writers in a mask shop. So that's certainly a driver for us, and we think that as we move through the end of this year and into next year, I think that there's momentum around that that continues.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. That's all I have.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, if you look at the Gartner data you said earlier, process control grew at roughly half the rate of WFE. And obviously, that make sense given how much the spend is driven by memory. Curious what the scenario you would see where process control would outgrow WFE. And do you think that that's something we could see over the next 6, 12, 18, 24 months? And if so, what would be the precise drivers there?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. C.J., great question. I think if we just held firm, in other words if the mix didn't move as much toward memory and if you held memory as a ratio to foundry logic was the same in a year where it was flat, then of course we believe process control intensity would grow. Even though process control intensity did go up in memory, as Bren mentioned and as you all know, it can't make up for the mix shift that we saw. So I'd say that would be the main way of process control intensity because a growing memory market on a relative basis but on a process control intensity that goes down if you do a weighted average.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I mean, we've looked at it, C.J. I mean, a rule of thumb is usually for about a 10-point swing in mix you end up with 70 or 80 basis point shift in intensity. So it tends to move around a little bit depending on who's buying and so on, but that's a reasonable way to think about it. So to Rick's point, certainly we start to see foundry logic as a percent of total increase, and that will be good for process control intensity. And we've seen it at closer to the 50% range and 50% to 60% – 50% foundry or so in that ballpark is when we've seen process control outperform. To Rick's point, I think as you move into an EUV environment, certainly if the process control may be scaling with litho, that certainly maybe adds a different element to the ability for process control to grow online.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: That's helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, are you guys disclosing bookings backlog anymore? No?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We do in our 10-K. If I give you the backlog and the shipment, then that sort of gets you to the bookings number. But I will tell you that we were slightly below a book-to-bill of 1 this quarter.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And then one quick follow-on. As you think about the transaction with Orbotech, what are the restrictions on your ability to buy back shares between now and close?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there's a small window that I have this quarter or prior to – from the opening of our quiet period to the filing of the prospectus and the S-4. So it's a very small window where we will begin our activity but it'll be limited. So then we have no restrictions – so we're restricted at that point and then we have no restriction after the shareholder vote has occurred. So based on current schedules and those could move around, based on comments from the SEC and so on if you get those, but that would imply that we would begin buying back in a more significant way sometime in the second half of next quarter, of the September quarter.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Very helpful. Thank you.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. You may go ahead.
Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Rick, maybe first off in terms of the capital intensity trends you're seeing in the memory market as a whole. Obviously 3D NAND has helped a lot of your metrology business, but DRAM has also picked up in terms of spending for both 2018 and may carry into 2019. I know your inspection business benefits from the more multi-patterning steps, but are there other areas or other applications as DRAM continues to shrink that also benefit, I guess, both process control intensity and for you specifically?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes. For DRAM, we do see a push for more capability for inspection, both the high-speed kind of inspection that we do in monitoring, which is laser scanning based but also in development, which is GEN 5 oriented and the leading edge. We also see overlay challenges in DRAM are very significant, and it drives our metrology business for overlay. And so yes, there is an increasing trend. 3D NAND has probably had more growth and on a relative basis than DRAM, but we do see increasing trends in DRAM as well.
Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question going back to China for a second. I think last quarter you talked about the Chinese foundry segment being a area, one, of growth, but also that's probably the area first where you're seeing a pickup. It seems like this call has kind of shifted a bit to the memory side of things. Is the Chinese foundry markets still tracking as you thought and it's just being supplemented now by the memory market?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I think that the Chinese foundry market has slowed a little bit and we're seeing some delays there whereas the Chinese memory market continues to move forward the investment and they're dealing with all the things you'd expect from bringing greenfield fabs up in terms of challenges with getting facilities ready and tools installed. But we do see strength in the memory. As Bren said, we'll see more of that. It has been a little bit softer on the foundry side, though.
Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thank you very much.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Just on the mix from an order perspective, and there's some lead time to these orders because of the site construction. But order profile in calendar 2018 is probably closer to 50/50. So the order profile in 2017 was heavier memory, and those are the tools that are shipping. So from a shipment perspective, it's more memory-centric. But the orders, which will start – will come through and will ship into next year have a more of an equal weight to them.
Patrick J Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you so much. I guess on your foundry business, how should we think about the breadth of your business as the industry approaches 7 nanometer-plus and then 5 nanometer? Should we expect something similar to 28 where you had multiple customers investing pretty aggressively, or a fairly consolidated customer mix there?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We haven't really seen dropout happen for many players as we're going to 7 nanometer, so I'd say the same people that were in, I think they're phased in terms of their investment. There aren't that many players doing the advanced design rules for foundry but they're all still in and we expect them at various phases to be investing. So no real change in breadth from the foundries on the advanced nodes.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. And then as my follow-up, I think last quarter you guys talked about domestic China orders tripling in 2017. Curious what your expectations are for 2018, if any? Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see a continuation of the momentum there just given where they are in terms of the early innings with some of these investments. I would say the numbers look relatively flat to us from an order perspective my lead time comment earlier notwithstanding. So we'll see how it plays through as they move through the quarter. Obviously, there's some second-half dependency to that profile but for right now it looks like it's fairly consistent versus what we saw last year.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. You may go ahead.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet: Yes. Thank you. And I apologize I also have a question about foundry. I guess your major foundry customers, my impression is they generate a meaningful portion of the revenues from the mobile market. And that market is pretty subdued across the board. And so the question is can we see a sustained recovery in your foundry business as smartphone demand remains weak? Because seeing foundry revenues even for June down a healthy double-digit percentage, it just doesn't seem like the node transitions are enough.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, we're pretty down in foundry. So I mean, I think our profile is consistent with that. And we don't anticipate a lot of strength in foundry until we get later into the end of the year and into 2019. So all our commentary and all our forecasting agrees with your thesis that there's a point here. We are seeing increased activities, however, around advanced node and investment and that's, of course, the precursor to more investment that's coming. So we're definitely seeing it and some of the reticle business that we're seeing now is in support of that. So given historical patterns, the same path is being followed where you have the initial investment around the development followed by a ramp. The size of those ramps may be smaller than in the past, and that's part of what we anticipate and model as we talk about our business going forward.
Romit Jitendra Shah - Nomura Instinet: Okay. Great. Thanks, Bren.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. You may go ahead.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and good job on the quarter. Rick, you were a keynote speaker at recent SEMICON China. I'm sure you got a chance to talk to some of the executives driving the China 2025 plan. How do you expect domestic Chinese spending to behave in the face of the recent trade tariffs and the tensions between U.S. and China? And then I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Right. I don't think anything's changed from the perspective of the Chinese in terms of what we've seen in terms of some of the discussions. This is a program to gain self-sufficiency in memory and in logic over time because China's such a big importer of semiconductors. So I don't think there's any change. I thought you were going to ask me what does it sound like? And we take their numbers and cut them in half and we still have a big growth forecast for China based on the investment level that we're seeing and the activity that's going on there. But I don't see any change as a result of any of the recent noise in the system around trade.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then as a follow-up on the Orbotech deal, I'm curious what kind of feedback have you received from your three big customers on this deal? And Bren, if you can just talk about the regulatory milestones required on this deal? Does it require China MOFCOM approval and some of the other approvals? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I'll take the first part and Bren could take the second. There's really been very little commentary from customers. This is such a different deal that even in the case where the larger customers are focused on some of them have interest in both areas, they're not in the same organization so there's not much overlap. I think the one thing that our customers have said consistently is they don't want us to lose focus on what we're doing for them and we're not. Structurally, we're going to organize in such a way that we will maintain every bit as much focus as we have today supporting our existing customers. But that has been the only commentary we've heard at all is please continue to support us but there was no assumption by them, that we wouldn't. They just – when they felt compelled to voice something, that was it.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: And then on the regulatory front, I mean, by the end of this week we will have had all of our filings submitted which is our plan and according to schedule. There's one that will take another week or so, and that's not for any reason other than that there's a holiday in that country that's delaying the submission given the clock that exists on the review period. So everything moving according to plan.
Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Jeff, our next question?
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham. You may go ahead.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess just a quick follow-up on the Orbotech deal as well. So with kind of this trade tension with China and U.S., do you see that potentially creates some challenges for you guys to get the regulatory approval from MOFCOM?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: We don't. That's not something that we have heard about. I think that again, if you look at the nature of any of the deals that have had issues associated with that, they look nothing like this. So we don't anticipate that.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying that. And then, Rick, on your -- answering one of the question, you mentioned that you see EUV and DUV to process control intensity similar – in a similar or even a higher level. Can you clarify that? Is that mostly coming in with higher reticle inspection in EUV? And just to be really clear, are you talking about EUV versus similar type of multi-patterning DUV process, you get a similar process control CapEx per CapEx spend? If you can provide some color on that. Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Well, we haven't worked out the entire model of that. But if you're just talking about what it takes in process control intensity to support a deep UV scanner versus what it takes to support an EUV scanner, obviously an EUV scanner is more expensive. But the tools necessary from a process control standpoint to support that are more advanced or are more intense. So the resulting intensity around a scanner choice actually goes up slightly in terms of total dollars, acknowledging that the cost of an EUV scanner is higher, the process control intensity actually scale a little bit faster than the scanner cost in order to support it. And that's simply the ecosystem around the scanner. So the reticle qualifying, the wafer is qualifying, the image, the measurements that are necessary to support that. It doesn't take into account all the other things where there'd be a reduction in layers. But just from that standpoint, so we view the EUV as being a catalyst for additional growth for KLA-Tencor as it comes online.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Actually that's very helpful. Thank you.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Mr. Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. I'm still trying to make sense of this foundry shipment into the back half of the year. If you look at Lam's shipments, and I know that Lam's obviously a different company but – and you sort of noodle through their guidance, it implies that foundry shipments are like up 2x the second half versus first half. And if you graphed their shipments versus your shipments, there's a pretty strong correlation between the trend for them and the trend for you. And it seems like maybe this time it's like breaking down a little bit, and maybe the answer is that you are seeing an offset from this change at a big logic customer, maybe that's sort of offsetting some of what would otherwise be a very, very strong foundry ramp so that that stuff ultimately comes back, but maybe it just gets pushed into next year. I'm just kind of trying to make sense of that. Thank you.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Tim. It's Bren. So our foundry shipments of the second half are higher than the first half. So I want to be clear about that and in a pretty meaningful way. I mean, I think it's getting dwarfed by the amount of the memory shipments. But when you talk about shipment profile in the range that we discussed, somewhere in the $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion range, the 60% to 70% of that will be memory, and that's how we're seeing it. But there is a pickup. But on an absolute basis, certainly foundry is weaker overall compared to the inflections in memory we're seeing.
Timothy Arcuri - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, Bren. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. You may ask your questions.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up. KLA has always kind of separated itself from the pack due to its premium margin structure or free cash flow generation. I'm just trying to do a sanity check here. So pro forma for Orbotech, I think the target operating margin is looking to be 36%. So are the free cash flow margins going to be somewhere in that kind of 32% to 34% range? Or how should we think about free cash flow margins pro forma for the combined company?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes. So when we look at pro forma operating margins in the timeframe of, let's say, post synergy realization, 2020 pro forma, you'll end up with about, yeah, 36% or so operating income. So if we think against that level of income, we would see free cash flow margins somewhere in the – consistent with where we are today, maybe slightly below because our operating margins are a little bit higher. But the relative capital intensity of the two businesses is similar. So I think we're in and around that 30% range against that level of operating income. And obviously, it'll vary depending on where we are in terms of working capital investments and so on. But one thing that's attractive about the business is the growth but also the lower capital intensity of it. And so as we bring it together, and as we start to drive through synergies and scale these businesses and get up to these mid- to high-30% operating margins, we should be able to drive free cash flow margin somewhere in the – right around 30% plus or minus.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, please continue.
Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in KLA-Tencor.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Magen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Magen. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on KLA-Tencor's investor relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Leading off with the December quarter highlights, KLA-Tencor reported another record quarter, delivering new quarterly highs in shipments, revenues, gross margin, non-GAAP earnings per share in the period. Full year results for calendar 2017 also set records in each of these metrics as well as in free cash flow generation. These outstanding results demonstrate the dedication that runs throughout our organization to serving our customers and delivering results to our stockholders as well as the long-term value generated and successful execution of the company's strategic objectives. I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the dynamics underlying our record performance and the momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today. I will begin with the orders for our optical inspection products, including both patterned and un-patterned wafer inspection, which grew 18% in calendar 2017, following 11% growth in 2016. Total optical inspection revenue grew to record levels for the second consecutive year in 2017. The same expansion we are experiencing in these core markets for KLA-Tencor are partially driven by strong customer acceptance of three of our major pattern inspection systems. Gen 5, our flagship broadband plasma inspection platform, is being deployed by customers across all segments and is solving their most critical defect in yield challenges. The ramp of Gen 5 is performing to our expectations and we are seeing an increasing number of layers implemented for production, for advanced logic and memory devices. In addition, the Gen 4 broadband plasma inspection platform and the Puma laser scanning platforms continue to provide the most cost effective wafer inspection performance to meet current yield and quality production requirements. Additionally, our un-patterned or bare wafer inspection and metrology products are also experiencing record demand today. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new process control capability to meet strong wafer demand, while IC customers are adding new bear wafer products to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in a greater number of layers for advanced technologies. Next, KLA-Tencor is playing an enabling role in bringing EUV lithography technology to market, by collaborating with every EUV customer to accelerate technology development and yield learning for critical wafer and mask inspection applications. The process control applications inherent to EUV mainly lie in mask manufacturing and requalification, resist qualification and scanner control. These along with the unique patterning and defectivity issues associated with the current EUV sourced technology present market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address with the most comprehensive suite of product technologies in the industry. We are already generating meaningful revenue from early adoption of EUV and this new technology promises to be a positive catalyst for future growth of the advanced process control market and as the market leader for KLA. And finally growth in China, investment in the Chinese semiconductor industry is currently driving an inflection in demand for the global wafer fab equipment market. And the China build out is expected to be a major factor underlying industry growth for years to come. As the leader in process control, KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong, both in terms of customer share and an adoption. Orders from native Chinese customers nearly tripled in 2017 and this strong momentum is expected to continue into 2018. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2017 results demonstrate the company's innovation and technology leadership. We are operating from a position of strength, as we embark on another year of expected growth and strong stockholder returns. Looking ahead to 2018, given our record backlog levels and the strong momentum we are experiencing in the marketplace today, revenue growth is expected to be in the high single digits for the year and is positioned to outperform overall WFE industry growth. As always, KLA-Tencor's strong relative performance will be fueled by our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customers' success and our continued focus on operations execution. The stage is set to build on the momentum and record performance delivered in calendar 2017 and deliver what we expect to be another exciting year of growth in 2018. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution in the December quarter and in calendar 2017. Shipments, revenues, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in at the upper end or above the range of guidance and achieved new records in both the December quarter and for the calendar year. Revenue in the quarter was 976 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.97 and would have been $1.83 at the guided tax rate of 18% for the quarter. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.86 in December, largely resulting from a charge taken in the quarter for the transition tax on historical cumulative earnings outside of the US and tax asset and liabilities revaluation related to the new tax law. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now, turning to highlights of the December quarter, demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were 1.041 billion in December, up 7% sequentially and finishing above the guided range for the quarter as customer pull for tool deliveries across the product portfolio drove upside to the quarter. Looking forward, we are modeling March quarter shipments to be in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion. Our expectation is for shipment levels for the first half of calendar '18 to be roughly flat compared to the second half of 2017 and with low to mid single digit have to have growth planned in the second half of the calendar year. For the full year, shipments are expected to grow in the high single digits compared with 2017. Memory was 71% of shipments and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory will continue to dominate the system shipment mix in the March quarter with memory shipments expected to be approximately 70% of the quarter total. Foundry was 20% of shipments in December, as expected and Foundry is forecasted to be about 15% of shipments in March. Logic was 9% of shipments in the December quarter and is currently forecasted to be 15% in March. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 47% of shipments; patterning was 30%. Patterning includes orders for reticle inspection. Service was 21% and non-semi was approximately 2%. I'll turn now to further details of the income statement. As I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 976 million in December. We expect revenue to be in the range of 970 million to 1.03 billion in the March quarter. In terms of half to half expectations for 2018, we are currently modeling revenue in the second half of the year to grow in the low to mid-single digits versus the first half of the calendar year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, a new record for the company and above the guided range of 63% to 64%, largely as a result of a stronger than modeled product mix. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% in the March quarter. In the earnings call last October, we provided gross margin expectations of 63% to 64% for calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for revenue growth, customer acceptance of key products, cost management and execution and the mix of system business in the year. Looking ahead, we believe our gross margins will likely bias towards the higher end of this guided range in 2018. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were 262 million in Q4, up as expected compared with the September quarter due to expenses related to advanced technology development programs for EUV lithography. Non-GAAP operating margin was flat compared to Q3 at 37.7%. We are currently sizing operating expense levels to be approximately 255 million in the March quarter. Beyond that, our outlook is for quarterly operating expenses to be in the $260 million range throughout calendar year 2018 based on our expectations for high single digit revenue growth for the year and consistent with our published business model. Given the strong gross margin profile I referenced, we should continue to deliver operating margins at the higher - or the upper end or above this model for the foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.5% in the quarter, resulting from the required true-up of our tax rate estimate for fiscal year '18, ending in June due to the reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1. Included in the GAAP results is an estimated charge of approximately 442 million associated with the new tax law passed by Congress and signed by the President in late December. The vast majority of the charge is related to the transition tax for the accumulative historical earnings the company earned outside of the US. In addition, we also incurred a charge related to revaluing our deferred tax assets based on the lower US tax rate. This tax charge will be adjusted over the next few quarters as additional financial information and regulatory guidance and interpretation becomes available. In terms of the expected impact of the new tax law on KLA-Tencor, our preliminary analysis indicate the changes in the tax law will be beneficial to the company and to our stockholders, as the annual ongoing US tax liability for the company will be meaningfully lower. Furthermore, the new territorial tax system will enable us additional flexibility to repatriate future foreign earnings and allow access to cash to productively invest in the business, pursue compelling strategic growth opportunities and return cash to stockholders without any additional US tax liability. Based on our initial modeling, we expect the overall worldwide tax planning rate of 20% provided last October, based on the expected mix of business in 2018 to decrease by approximately 500 basis points and allow access to all free cash flow generated, irrespective of geographical IP ownership or manufacturing location. As a result, going forward, the new recommended tax rate for modeling purposes is 15%. Finally, net income for the December quarter was 309 million and we ended the quarter with 157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.76 billion, a decrease of approximately 298 million compared with the September quarter, primarily due to repayment and maturity of 250 million in public bonds and a net reduction of 40 million in bank loans. Cash from operations was 129 million in the quarter and free cash flow was 116 million. For the full year in 2017, free cash flow was 1.14 billion. Consistent with our proactive track record of returning cash to stockholders, we believe that unallocated free cash flow is valued only when it is productively deployed. Going forward, the new tax environment will afford the company additional flexibility to continue to optimize this fundamental aspect of the company's strategy. We will have more to say on this topic in the coming weeks. In December, we paid an aggregate of 92.6 million regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased $40 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. The company has approximately 4.9 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in December reflect our market leadership and our industry leading business model. This coupled with ending total backlog of approximately 1.9 billion position the company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '18. Current forecasts are for the WFE market to grow mid-single digits in 2018. Against this industry setting, we are modeling the company revenue to grow in the high single digits in the year, stronger than the broader market and with operating performance expected at the high end of the range of these revenue levels in our target model. So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is, shipments in the range of 945 million to 1.025 billion; revenue between 970 million and 1.03 billion and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.85 to $2.09 per share with GAAP diluted EPS of $1.84 to $2.08 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you. Bren. And is always, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per firm and a brief follow-up so that we can accommodate as many questions as possible. Okay. Magen, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the overall strategy for capital deployment. Can you just talk about how are you thinking about [indiscernible]. And if I think about your prior commentary, you've always said that if it's a tax reform, you would think about giving back more to the shareholders. So if you can just comment on that, that would be really helpful.
Bren Higgins: Sure, Farhan. It's Bren. Thanks for the question. It's certainly an exciting time for the company and I think given our historical track record around how we think about deploying cash in the business, either investing in the business or how we look at M&A opportunities or certainly returns to shareholders, it's an opportunity that adds additional flexibility to what we can do going forward. As I said in the prepared remarks, we don't have any update today, although, we do expect to have more to say on the topic in the coming weeks. I would say philosophically, our position is no different. We have a great business, a strong business model. It's not capital intensive and so the free cash flow margin is pretty strong. And so, we have the ability to return, I think, a fair amount of cash to shareholders, if that is where our process takes us. We're not compelled at this point to do any significant de-levering. We've been doing that over the course of the year. We have the leverage in the right place for the company. And so going forward, I think we have to look at the alternatives and make those calls. Our feelings haven't changed. We're going to grow the dividend certainly over time, consistent with the growth rate in cash flow. And, or the earnings of the company and we're going to target a payout ratio that's somewhere in the through cycle 40% to 50%. So I think that part of the strategy is well understood. And as far as the cash reserves on the balance sheet, we'll have more to say about that coming in the next few weeks.
Farhan Ahmad: And then, in regards to my second question, can you just talk about the e-beam versus optical. There is a concern in the market that ASML is ramping their holistic lithography. That can be a threat to your business. Can you just, at a high level, talk about how do you see that as a competitor to the optical inspection technology?
Rick Wallace: Sure. We've seen, as you know Farhan, the Gen 5 has really been the tool we've been deploying for leading edge really across the board with our customers in terms of advanced memory, both in NAND, but also in DRAM, but also in advanced logic and we've seen good adoption of that. As we said in the prepared remarks, we continue to see development being - leveraging the capabilities of Gen 5 and that product has a lot of legs. As you know, that was recently introduced and there's quite a roadmap for that. So, customers definitely want the coverage capable, only really delivered by Gen 5 and they want to have continue to be able to leverage optical, just the price performance relative to e-beam. There is a place for e-beam, there's been a place for e-beam for many years and we suspect that will continue. But on a relative basis, we had a record year in optical wafer inspection in 2017 and we expect that to continue in 2018.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: We're hearing that in addition to using Gen 5 for print check and also for early defect learning for EUV based technologies that some of your customers may be actually looking to use Gen 5 for high volume production, even this year before EUR, just given some of the yield challenges associated with some of these next generation manufacturing technologies. Is it something that you guys are actually seeing and is this just with your foundry and logic customers or is this also across some of your memory customers?
Rick Wallace: Harlan, great question. As is typical, when we introduce a new tool, depending on the particular user and their ability to understand the value and to leverage in, some of the early users tend to deploy first in production. We are seeing it in production on some layers. There are typically the more critical layers where it provides a pronounced benefit from capabilities they had before. We have had recent customer experience where they're now able to detect inline defects that they before could only see end of line, as they were missed by prior optical tools and also not detectable by e-beam. So those tools are being deployed in line. It really is in both logic and memory structures, perhaps a little more surprising with some of the memory applications that we've seen. So we're encouraged by those signs and we fully expect that to continue.
Bren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. The only thing I'll add is, is that Gen 5, the reception to Gen 5 from a value perspective has been really strong with the customer base over the last 12 to 18 months or so. And as we look at 2018, part of the company's year-to-year performance is driven by a bigger contribution from that product line. So, you mentioned print checks. Certainly, there's a lot of value that's demonstrated there. Defect discovery is still the place where it competes and where we saw the growth there where it has made significant inroads against the e-beam opportunities for the reasons Rick talked about earlier. But then also in some of these really high end opportunities in early production and difficult layers, so really across all segments, we're pretty confident with what we're seeing there and excited to get a higher level adoption of this product as we move forward over the course of the year.
Harlan Sur: And then on EUV mask inspection, as EUV starts to ramp here, what's the traction been like with the Teron platform in conjunction with 5 for print check, first question. And then more importantly, for kind of next generation high volume EUV mask inspection, can you guys just give us an update on your multi-beam mask inspection platform. What's been the early feedback from your lead alpha customers here?
Rick Wallace: Sure. The Teron isn't really used for print check, it's used for the mask development. So - and that's, we're seeing great demand for that across a number of players, simply because of the increased activity in terms of EUV mask production. So that's really the workhorse right now for the industry in terms of, for the, [indiscernible]. We have had a lot of interest in multi-beam. I do think customers, as they contemplate high volume, they are going to work through, I think, a couple of scenarios. The most likely is, there will be some level of e-bean inspection and there'll be print check inspection and the print check, we're well suited to support that with the Gen 5 platform and there's a lot of interest as I said in the multi-beam and we've got a heavy customer engagements on that front. But as we said, when we first started discussing that tool, that's still a ways out, I think that we will intercept the market when it's needed in terms of volume. Right now, it's really people preparing for volume down the road.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.
C.J. Muse: I guess first question, when I think about your WFE guide and I compare it to Lam's, you're coming in a little bit lighter and it sounds like DRAM was one of the principal drivers of the uplift at least for them. So I guess a question off of that which is, are you contemplating upside from DRAM within your model here in calendar '18, particularly as you think about some of the more logic related structures that are being adopted, as we move to 18-nanometer, would love to hear your thoughts on that front.
Rick Wallace: Yes. C.J., I don't think we're that far off where Lam is, we're talking about, at the beginning of the year in a few percentage points. So there's a margin for error on this that probably puts this all in about the same place. I think fundamentally, the way they talk about segments from what I understand was, around memory, with DRAM strength, NAND flash strength in the year. We think we see a little bit more logic strength at least around our business. And, foundry looks like it'll be down some. So add it all up, you end up in this mid 5%, 7% type single digit growth rates. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in DRAM in terms of adoption from a process control intensity perspective. You have more logic in the devices, you also have the dynamics that are happening in China that are good for process control adoption intensity as well. So I think one of the good - really strong stories about the company right now, given the improvements we've seen in intensity is to have a year that is this strong around memory and have the company in a position to perform at least in line with the market and at least as the way we wanted, perhaps a little bit better. So we're really encouraged by what we're seeing across all segments and I think there's opportunities for us to solve unique problems, given the technology transitions that are in front of us.
C.J. Muse: And I guess as my follow up, as you think about second half rise in shipment and I guess I'm making the assumption, correct me if I'm wrong that logic foundry will be greater percentage there, which I would think would deliver upside to gross margin. So should we be contemplating an uplift to gross margins through the year for you guys.
Bren Higgins: So I think the way you're modeling it in terms of the segment mix half to half is right. I mean, it's still pretty strong memory through the course of the year, but foundry logic does pick up in to the second half. I think, one of the wildcards in the year is the order profile into the December quarter and in that time frame is pretty strong around foundry. So depending on when those orders actually materialize, that there's a pull in, does that create opportunity at the end of the year to ship those tools or not. Right now, we haven't slotted the way that we do with these four orders in Q4. So around gross margins, our gross margin profile across the different segments is not any different. The way that the company delivers value - we share value with customers, the ROI is understood, the pricing is very consistent and so sometimes mix of products changes a little bit, but I'm modeling gross margin consistent with the prepared remarks, the bias to the higher end of the range of 63% to 64% that I mentioned. And over the course of the year, movement within the quarters will be driven largely by some smaller product mix issues here and there, but I expect most quarters to be operating in and around the range I mentioned in the prepared remarks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok: Just a fall question on China. I think some of your peers is talking kind of increased spending from the domestic memory chip makers now and I think historically an investor base be that that will be very possible for KLA. I'm just curious where do we stand on that? Do you have any update in terms of the cadence of that spending? Are we seeing a strong pickup this year or it's really more like '19.
Bren Higgins: Yes. So it's been a good segment of business for us. China, as a region, as Rick mentioned in his comments, we saw a tripling of native China bookings in calendar '17 versus calendar '16. Those orders tend to come with longer lead times, given the nature of not just new fabs, but also new fabs and new locations. So there's always infrastructure and other requirements that are part of the equation to get something up and running. As we look at calendar '18, I don't see any change in momentum. I think the mix shifts a little bit, where it was more 50-50 memory foundry in calendar '17. Again, this is from an order perspective, calendar '18 seems a little bit more foundry heavy. But the contribution roughly in the same in the same range. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing there and as these projects come up to speed and they start to make progress, I think that's going to influence the timing of the next round or next phases of investment that happen over the coming years. But what's in front of us looks pretty good.
Edwin Mok: Just to be really clear, so you're basically not kind of low single digit growth does not factor in comp growth in China and it sounds like you expect a kind of similar level, but a mix shift there. Is that correct?
Bren Higgins: You know what, we'll ship more in '17 than we shipped in '16. My commentary was focused on the order mix. So yeah, there's more contribution from China in terms of shipment and revenue, native China in the calendar '18 numbers than there was in calendar '17.
Edwin Mok: And then my follow-up question is on the pattern wafer inspection market, it's really strong right now, but historically the business tend to be more, they go bigger cycle. Is there anything structurally changed for that market that give you confident that demand is sustainable?
Bren Higgins: A couple of things have. I think, it is true first of all that those businesses happen to be very strong when there is a reinvestment cycle, but there's a couple of - and to new technology and that can be driven by a couple of things, but one of the - volume of course drives and the other one is when there are new specs relative to, particularly based on design rules. The other thing we're seeing is the flatness market growing, an acquisition we did years ago is doing very well inside the bare wafer market to measure wafer flatness and that's being driven a lot by additional requirements, driven in part by 3D NAND. And so we're seeing new specs, driving new tool purchases in addition to the traditional drivers of volume and sensitivity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.
Romit Shah: I just had one question for you, Rick. It just seems like as demand for AI and server/ high performance computing hardware inflects the size of the silicon that powers that functionality is also growing at a fairly tremendous rate. Nvidia's got a V100 GPU that they say has north of 20 billion transistors. And so the byproduct of that is that you've got these very high performance CPEs and GPEs, but the yields are not great. And it would seem like the implication here is that demand for top tier process control equipment should be stronger benefit from this trend and I was hoping you could talk about that.
Rick Wallace: Sure. Yes, absolutely. One of the main drivers is the push for AI and also the high performance computing just in general as a category and we are seeing and it plays really on a couple of places for us. One, it drives additional designs, which drives mask, which drives our mask business. So we are seeing benefit. And then in the fab, the additional complexity of those very advanced chips drives everything about complexity, including defectivity requirements because a larger die and also the metrology requirements associated with it. So it is a positive inflection for us overall and it is going to be a multiple foundries as well, not just in one. So there are other players in that. So we expect that to be something that continues to drive the need for process control as we go forward.
Romit Shah: Is it fair to say that this trend, as it accelerates is good for your blended ASPs and then consequently your gross margins over time.
Rick Wallace: Well, certainly the percentage of tooling as Bren mentioned, we're not really customer dependent on gross margin as we are mix, but as the process gets more complex, the mix of customer use case tends to go toward the more advanced tools. So sure, we would see a benefit in terms of our overall profitability and business level based on advanced devices of any kind, pushing demand forward. So yes, absolutely it's a driver for us.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho: Rick, in terms of memory capital intensity, you've talked about in the past how 3-D NAND and a lot of the manufacturing challenges there has helped increase process control intensity. I know, we're at the early ramp of the new 64-layer devices that we're seeing in the marketplace, but as we go to 96 and 128, are the increases in layer going to continue to help in capital intensity or have we kind of just reached maybe a leveling at this time? I think you said you've gain one or two percentage process control intensity points with the 3-D transition. How do you look at it as we go to more layers?
Rick Wallace: Great question and the answer is there is more opportunity. And there's two ways for us to address that. One is continued and even more deployment of existing tools, which I don't think would drive intensity significantly higher, if that's all we do, but we do have new tools in the pipeline to address 3D NAND and when those come online and they're going to be in support of these advanced technologies, then we can actually drive increased adoption based on new use cases. There are more problems in 3D NAND metrology and defectivity than we can solve right now. And if we can bring the new tools out and get those in and those are something that we're targeting for in the next 12 to 24, having starting to make an impact on the market. So yeah, that will drive intensity up.
Patrick Ho: Great. And a question for Bren in terms of managing supply chain, obviously yourself and the rest of the equipment industry, you're seeing record demand today and you've been able to turn around tools at a pretty rapid rate, even as demand trends continue to rise. You're also managing your inventories and AR really well. What have you done over the last couple of quarters, especially as you've seen this rise in demand and your ability to continue to I guess deliver to the customers, given their kind of strict and tight timelines for tool deliveries.
Bren Higgins: Yeah. Well, it hasn't been easy. A lot of heavy lifting by the operational teams to execute in this environment. I mean, one of the things that we've done I think pretty effectively across all of our products is to do a lot more hedging of long lead time materials, whether we're buying supplier long lead time materials or we're buying our - the assembled parts and that shortens the lead time and gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to deliver. So that certainly is one of the things we're doing. I mean obviously, we're making stronger commitments further out in some cases to be able to make sure we've got the supplier ramping their capacity to be able to support us. So a lot of tactical things there to be able to deliver that. We're spending some time sometimes, sending our own guys out to work with our suppliers to improve their processes to deliver better yields of parts and so on to be able to meet our needs. So a lot of small things there. Like everybody else, we're putting a lot of pressure on the chain. Some of our suppliers are unique and supply only to us in this space. So that helps in some cases, but it's a challenge, but so far we're doing okay with it and I'm really pleased with the leverage and the operational execution in the factories across the world for us.
Operator: Your final question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup.
Atif Malik: Rick, I have a question on your foundry opportunity. TSMC on its earnings call talked about a flattish CapEx, with capital intensity longer term coming down from low to - 20% to 30% for them. Within that declining capital intensity, can you just talk about how do you see PDC opportunity for you? I assume EUV opportunity is obviously growing within that CapEx, but just talk about the PDC opportunity for you guys? And then I have a follow-up.
Rick Wallace: Sure. I think that the foundry capital intensity ranges depending on where we are in the cycle and the customer, but it's somewhere in the order of 15% to 17%. We see upside to that, if we can provide more capability as we discussed earlier in 3D NAND. There are problems that are unsolved in terms of foundry and especially as we get to EUV. So we think that'll head toward the high end of that range. And customers of course are going to try to optimize their investment and try to minimize their investment in capital and in process control. So we're constantly showing that we have created value for them and then we share that value in terms of the way we deploy in the market. So I think as we're modeling it forward, it continues to be in that 15% to 17% range.
Atif Malik: Great. And then Bren, are you expecting your logic plus foundry opportunity this year to be flattish over last year, like prior comments or has there been a change to that.
Bren Higgins: As I look at it and I look at the breadth of customers investing across foundry and as more of a shipment statement, I think the foundry shipments are probably down a little bit. So I think our expectations would be around foundry, as I said earlier, we're - foundry down a little bit, logic up, DRAM strong and NAND obviously strong as well. So that's how you get to the guidance we provided for WC.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Magen. Thank you all for joining us today and enjoy the rest of your day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to KLA-Tencor's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Theodore Lockwood: Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30, 2017. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com. A simulcast of this call will be available on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor presentation on our website. There, you'll also find the calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2017. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Ed. I'm pleased to report that KLA-Tencor delivered record shipments, revenue and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the September quarter, the results of continued successful execution of our long-term strategies and demonstrating once again the critical nature of process control in enabling growth and innovation in the semiconductor industry. Q3 results featured strong demand from memory customers and from the Japan and China regions. New orders in September were a record for the third calendar quarter, and new orders have now totaled approximately $3 billion on a year-to-date basis in calendar 2017. Coupled with our market leadership and supported by strong backlog, these results point to continued momentum of growth for KLA-Tencor and position the company to deliver new highs for revenue and earnings and strong stockholder returns in 2017 and 2018. This is a very exciting time for the company given our market and technology leadership. The road ahead features more opportunity for the industry, our company and for our stockholders than ever before. Before I turn the call over to Bren, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight how our strategies for customer success, innovation, productivity and talent are helping to drive KLA-Tencor's record-setting performance today and are building a solid foundation for continued growth in the future. The first and most enduring objective for KLA-Tencor is customer success enabled by the use of our process control solutions. To achieve this goal, we focus on partnering with our customers to help empower their growth. We drive engagement to enable us to develop differentiated solutions for our customers, most complex yield challenges in the current node and the anticipated yield challenges in future technologies. The rapid growth of our China business is an example of how successful execution of collaboration and customer success strategies are fueling growth. China's investment and their domestic semiconductor industry is driving an inflection for the overall WFE market, and KLA-Tencor's market position in China is strong both in terms of process control adoption and market share. Business levels in this region are expected to grow significantly in calendar year 2017, and this momentum should continue through 2018. The focus on innovation at KLA-Tencor is tightly integrated with our customer success efforts. We are investing in a very high level to drive innovation in process control and deliver a steady stream of advanced solutions and services that will enable our customers to succeed with their most critical technologies. Today, we are developing 5 major technology platforms, 2 of which are targeted specifically at memory, and we're modeling higher process control adoption and record revenue from memory customers in 2017. For example, growth from memory customers is a key factor in the record business levels we're experiencing in our bare wafer inspection and metrology products. Wafer manufacturers have been adding new capacity to ramp wafer demand, and IC customers are moving to higher-layer accounts and increasingly more complex architectures. In this environment, our new bare wafer products are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies. I'm also excited to report that our Gen 5 broadband plasma wafer inspection platform continues to gain momentum in the marketplace. We're seeing increasing utilization of installed tools with our advanced logic and foundry customers where the unique value of Gen 5's illumination wavelength range is being demonstrated on 7-nanometer discovery and EUV print check applications. Based on these results and customer's feedback, we expect Gen 5 to continue to support customers in development of 7-nanometer technology, and we see it playing an even larger role on the development and ramp of the 5-nanometer node. A third component of our strategic objectives is productivity and the commitment to operational excellence. Through continuous execution of these strategies, our growth and market leadership results in industry-leading margins and cash flow and provides the resources for future investment and ongoing strong returns to stockholders. And finally, our focus on talent. KLA-Tencor's talent initiatives are centered on attracting, developing and inspiring our global workforce. We recruit top talent worldwide from experienced candidates as well as high-caliber graduates from leading universities. Ultimately, success of our execution on talent strategies lie at the core of our long-term success. So to summarize. Clearly, this is an exciting time for KLA-Tencor with the company reporting another quarter of record results in Q3 and demonstrating the strength of our strategic objectives in an environment of very strong overall industry demand. Looking ahead to 2018, given our anticipated backlog entering the year and the momentum we are experiencing today, the stage is set for another outstanding record-setting year for KLA-Tencor. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the September quarter featured another record results for the company driven by memory demand and solid operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments were a record $977 million, revenue was at the top end of the range and GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance for the quarter. This result was driven by continued strong demand across our product portfolio with particular strength from memory, wafer and captive mask shop customers. Our manufacturing and service organizations continue to deliver strong operational leverage on our revenue growth with incremental gross margins in excess of 80% over the last 2 quarters. Revenue and earnings per share were also records in Q3. Revenue was $970 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.78. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.80. In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focus on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to highlights for the September quarter demand environment in terms of shipments. Foundry was 40% of shipments in September driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry shipments to be approximately 20% of the total in the December quarter. Memory was 46% of shipments with deliveries evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling shipments to memory customers to be about 67% of the total in the December quarter with NAND representing about 55% of the memory mix. Logic was 14% of shipments in September and is currently forecasted to be approximately flat in the December quarter. Regarding the approximate distribution of shipments by product group. Wafer inspection was 46% of shipments; patterning was 30%, patterning includes shipments from our reticle inspection business; non-semi, which includes our back-end component inspection business, was approximately 3%; and service was 21% of shipments. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion. At this point, we expect shipments for the first half of calendar year 2018 to grow in the low single digits compared with the second half of 2017 and be roughly equally balanced half-over-half over the course of the year. This outlook is strengthened since our last earnings call in July. Turning now to the income statement. Revenue was $970 million in September, finishing at the top of the range of guidance, and we expect revenue to be in the range of $930 million to $990 million in the December quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.7%, above the range of expectations for the quarter. The stronger-than-expected gross margins in the quarter were due to a number of favorable factors in the systems business, including the favorable product mix and better-than-modeled parts expense and labor utilization in the service business. Looking forward to the December quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63% to 64% as we expect a similar product and service mix quarter-to-quarter with commensurate cost dynamics in our manufacturing service operations. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $252 million in September, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%. This operating margin result is in line with our updated target model for annual revenue levels in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range that we outlined earlier in the year. We are modeling operating expense levels to be approximately $260 million in the December quarter due to the expensing of significant prototype materials and other expenses related to technology development programs targeting reticle process control for EUV high-volume manufacturing applications. Given company revenue expectations for CY '18, we are currently sizing operating expense levels next year to be approximately $250 million per quarter, consistent with our public operating model.  Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17% in Q3 and below the guided rate of 20% for the quarter, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and certain other discrete items impacting the tax rate. For the December quarter, we expect the tax rate of 18% due to similar factors. For calendar '18, we are adjusting our long-term planning tax rate down to 20% largely due to the anticipated revenue mix in the year. We intend to update our tax rate guidance periodically based on the revenue expectations. Finally, non-GAAP net income for the September quarter was $284 million, and we ended the quarter with 158 million diluted shares outstanding. Turning now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, an increase of $40 million compared with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $374 million in September, and free cash flow was $358 million. We paid $156 million towards our outstanding term loan in the quarter and expect to retire our outstanding $250 million 2.375% 3-year senior notes upon maturity in November. Finally, during Q3, we paid an aggregate of $100 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units. In conclusion, today's results reflect our continued market leadership, the critical nature of process control in all customer segments and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by expected strong total backlog as of the end of the calendar year, position the company for continued growth in the strong and stable overall WFE industry environment. Given consensus expectations for WFE growth in the mid- to high single digits next year, our expectations for another year of strong memory investment, improving process control intensity in memory, contributions from new products and continued high single-digit annual growth in services, we are modeling total revenue in the $4 billion range in 2018. Against this revenue backdrop, operating performance is expected to be in line with the $3.9 billion to $4.2 billion annual revenue range outlined in our public business model. With that, to conclude, our guidance for the December quarter is shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion, revenue between $930 million and $990 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.58 to $1.82 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.59 to $1.83 per share. The December quarter EPS guidance range assumes an 18% tax rate in the quarter. This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Theodore Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'll open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]. All right. Christine, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: My first question is on the outlook for 2018. Can you just talk about what segments have strengthened since your last outlook? And in terms of foundry versus memory, where do you see growth and where do you see kind of flattish?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Farhan. So I think since last -- it's Bren. So since the last call, certainly our expectations for next year has strengthened over the last 3 months, and we're seeing that in our outward forecast, which I provided some details to you in this call. I think when we look at the data, I think with the investments that are happening in 3D NAND, I think we still continue to expect that to be very strong. DRAM also looks like it's probably stronger now than what we thought a few months ago, and I think foundry/logic is flattish. I think logic will be slightly higher. But overall, I think the foundry/logic segment will be largely flattish and probably more second half weighted as we see it flow through our shipment profile over the course of the year.
Farhan Ahmad: And then one question on the print check. Have you guys sized what could be the potential opportunity for print check? And what is the customer interest that you are seeing right now?
Richard Wallace: Farhan, you mean specifically for EUV?
Farhan Ahmad: Yes, specifically for EUV in terms of print check technology, how large that market could be.
Richard Wallace: Yes. Okay. Well, let's start with development and then think about HVM. For development, there's a lot of work. In fact, a fair amount of capacity of the Gen 5 systems are being used for print check and development. So I'd say that I don't think it consumes a tool right now, but it consumes part of the use case of a tool for us. When we get into HVM, it gets a little different. It depends on how big we think the adoption of EUV is and when. But we would expect that, that market grows because of just essentially the available technology for inspecting reticles. And so that will drive the print check market higher because there won't be an actinic tool for in-fab reticle for the first wave of tools. So I think you'd see it grow in size from them. We haven't sized it exactly, but I think for every company that adopts EUV in production, as the EUV scales, the applications for print check will grow commensurate. So maybe it gets to a couple tools per customer that are driving that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Just kind of follows up to the last question and based on some of your prepared commentary, it looks like you guys have seen some momentum on your reticle inspection platforms. And we've heard that at 7-nanometer EUV mask inspection, it's Teron platform plus Gen 5 print check. For 5-nanometer and below, though, it's kind of interesting because I think at the recent SPIE technical symposium, I think the KLA team actually talked about a multi-beam e-beam platform for EUV reticle inspection targeted at 5 nanometers and below. Can you guys just give us some more insights on this new multi-beam tool that you're developing? What are the benefits versus current generation? When is it going to be available? I know 5 nanometers is still a few years away, but I would imagine maybe some time in 2019? Any color there would be great.
Richard Wallace: Sure, Harlan. So the strategy for reticle inspection, as you mentioned, Teron right now is serving the need. And I think for customers, as they implement 7, whatever degree, 7 is going to be implemented, Teron with the combination with the Gen 5 for print check is the most economical and efficient solution for our customers. But you're right to point out that a 5-nanometer, our view was we will need more sensitivity on the reticle. Rather than design an inspection tool -- an e-beam inspection tool and modify a wafer tool and make it for reticle, we decided a couple years ago, several years ago, to target specifically the reticle market with a platform optimized for reticle inspection and being developed by a fair number of players from our platform that develop reticle tools for us. So we think we have a lot of expertise. We feel very good about that progress of that, and we are targeting introduction of that tool in the 2019 time frame to intercept 5-nanometer.
Bren Higgins: Hey, Harlan, it's Bren. One other point I'll make, and I said this is in prepared remarks, but one of the uplift that we're seeing, the onetime uplift we're seeing to our operating expenses here in the December quarter, is driven by some prototype investment that we're expensing for this program. So Rick's characterization of timing seems to make sense and program's progressing according to plan.
Harlan Sur: Great. And then your commentary on China suggests that you guys are seeing some of the activity on some of the China domestic memory R&D pilot programs. I think they're trying to show up in your pipeline. Are you going to be shipping some of these tools here this quarter? Or is this more kind of the first half of next year? And secondly, on the domestic China business, you guys have always said that process control intensity in general is about 100 basis points higher versus the mainstream guys. Is that kind of how it's playing out?
Bren Higgins: So Harlan, on your first part of your question, so for the new memory projects and there's about 3 significant ones that we're tracking, we booked some orders back in the June quarter for a DRAM project that we will start to ship at the end of this quarter, right at the tail end of this quarter for installation into next quarter. The -- we also booked in this quarter significant orders for a 3D NAND project, and so we'll see those orders probably ship out towards the June quarter time frame. So to answer your question, we will see that business start to come to the P&L next year.  This year was more memory weighted as I described and probably a little over double in terms of the bookings from -- in China versus last year. And as we look at 2018, the order profile looks like it's flat to up from there. So a significant amount of activity there. Obviously, based on success with these Phase 1 investments, we play a pretty significant role early on as they're ramping the fabs. And so process control intensity is higher. Share tends to be better also because of the -- just the experience we can bring to help these customers navigate their yield and ramp these fabs quickly. And obviously, in memory, being able to progress the technology road map matters a lot to the economics of these projects.
Richard Wallace: But just to add to that, I think -- remember the greenfield, in particular, these are not at-scale fabs. So we're at the front end where the intensity is higher as Bren was saying. I think the other advantage we will have in the memory market in China is some of the platforms that we've been developing for memory will come to maturity in time to support those, so we'll see process control intensity higher. But the investors in China and the fab managers are very focused on efficiency in all their investments, so we don't see them necessarily higher. It's more that the fabs are subscale and at the beginning of the ramp.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore.
Christopher Muse: First question on gross margins. Can you walk through what's driving the uplift in the December quarter? Is that simply just the greater revenues? And as you think to 2018, you outlined gross margin in line with your target model, 62%, 63%. Though if I look back in the last 4, 5, 6 quarters, you definitely hover around 63%, if not higher. So curious what we should be thinking about mix-wise that might drive that to the mid-point of your target model or whether you're just being conservative a bit.
Bren Higgins: Yes, on the last part first, C.J., I think that as we look at next year and look at the expected mix of business, we're likely going to see sustaining tailwinds that we've experienced in gross margin and we'll see that continue into next year. So as I'm modeling next year, I'm modeling it between 63% to may be as high as 64% over the course of the year. So pretty -- I think it continues, and what's driving it is a lot of the same factors. I mean, clearly, the product positioning and the differentiation and value we're adding to customers is playing out in the product pricing. I think the introduction of new products over the last 12 months or so -- the engineering execution has been great, so we've been able to climb up the cost curve pretty quickly on warranty and installation and some of those kind of things. We've been able to get a fair amount of leverage out of our service business as we've added tools into Korea and Taiwan. We can leverage the resources pretty well. So all in all, I think there's a number of factors, and I think that they're fairly sustaining as we progress into next year.
Christopher Muse: Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, if you think about the greenfield activity that's flowing through today, typically, that would be the ideal time for you guys in terms of process control intensity. So curious to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing both from a logic foundry perspective as well as from a memory perspective.
Bren Higgins: Well, I think Rick talked about from a memory perspective and what we're seeing in China. I think for the established customers, I mean, to that point, I mean, there is a participation -- a higher level of participation as they outfit a new fab on the front end. And then over time, the customer will probably scale back as they ramp that fab, as we generally see across a fab ramp. China is unique. Rick talked about that. And on foundry/logic, I don't think that there's anything different. I think it sort of follows the same model. There's a fair amount of development activity that happens upfront, and we participate above what the normal ramp level or the normal intensity levels are. And then over time as customers move from defect discovery to line monitoring, they tend to try to optimize a little bit more for fab productivity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company.
Yeuk-Fai Mok: So first, I guess, just kind of look a little longer term. I think you guys provided some color for 2018, including kind of outlook for second half of '18. Just curious, that's by a few quarters away. It seems like you have better visibility now than before. What gives you that better confidence? What's improving in visibility for you guys?
Bren Higgins: Well, so the statements were about the shipment profile. And as we look at this point and we look at the shipment profile into the second half of the year, it looks like based on the backlog we're bringing into the year and our expectations for orders in the first half gives us pretty good views into shipments into the second half. So we feel, at least at this point, it looks reasonably balanced across the year. And we're in this range of about $1 billion of shipments plus or minus $50 million as we look at our plan over the next several quarters. So it's still a ways out, and things can change. But based on how customers are slotting and how we're planning our manufacturing operations, that's how it looks.
Yeuk-Fai Mok: Okay. That's fair. Second question I have is on the service side of the businesses. If I look at some of your peers and some of other equipment manufacturer, they're actually seeing pretty strong growth in service, double-digit kind of growth rate, which is higher than historical. Do you see that being possible for your service business? Or you think that kind of a mid-single digit is a reasonable growth rate for your service business?
Bren Higgins: Well, service looks like in calendar '17 will grow about 10%. Now its historical growth rate has been about 8%, if you go back to, let's say, 2000 or so and play that through. Now it grows every year, as it should, as the installed base is growing. So we are seeing an acceleration in service, and we were open with this in our last discussion of just our modeling for the business over the long run that we think service can maintain its historical growth rate. So we think service runs probably 7% to 9% over time. And part of what's driving it obviously is the growth of the installed base, but also the mature and legacy fabs and how they're running those fabs now to meet IoT and automotive demand and so on. So we're adding new capacity to some of those tools. They're running the tools harder, so they're running them longer, and so the contract and billable streams are nice. And one thing about our service business is it's about 70% to 75% service contract. So it's a very predictable stream that we can build our cost structure around and move forward with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Can you remind us how you view process control intensity in memory going forward over the next couple of years? And I know you guys are working on a couple of initiatives in memory from a product development perspective. How big could the opportunity be with those initiatives over the next, say, 12 to 24 months?
Bren Higgins: Yes, so on process control intensity for in and around memory, I think at planar NAND versus 3D NAND and DRAM, DRAM was always around 9%. Planar NAND was probably 8% or so. And if we look at across total memory today, we're in that 9% to 10% range. Clearly, as we've been talking about for several months, we think there are some opportunities not only for more inspection in terms of various defectivity in 3D NAND, but also opportunities in and around metrology as metrology's much more intensive for 3D structures than planar structures. One thing that's also been driving our business is the increasing specs around flatness and wafer flatness for 3D NAND. And so we've seen our wafer customers investing more new capability to be able to produce wafers for the IC customers to be able to meet that spec challenge. That doesn't show up necessarily in some of our pure IC numbers from memory, but it's certainly a derivative effect that's positive. So we think we make some progress on these 2 offerings that we think that, that can probably drive to an opportunity that can be $200 million to $300 million across both platforms. I don't think you'll see that in '18. There's an adoption time line that's associated with that. But over time, it could be -- if we can solve the problem, I think there's an opportunity that's in that magnitude.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, you guys have talked about your business with some of the wafer manufacturers and even some of the mask shops. I guess you made some comments in your prepared remarks. I guess these are 2 customer groups that perhaps some of your peers don't necessarily have access to. So I guess I was curious, how big is -- how big are these 2 customer groups as a percentage of sales today? And what's kind of the outlook into 2018 when you think about their spending patterns?
Richard Wallace: Well, we don't break it out, but it is significant. And it is often the case that when there are new specs is when -- and new products is when we see new adoption of technologies. So it isn't something we break out, but it is significant, especially for certain of our products. Bare wafer inspection we mentioned and also flatness we mentioned as being critical. And then of course, in the mask shops, it's the reticle tools both for overlay -- registration, but also for defect inspection. But pretty significant, but usually, the investment cycle on those is a little bit more in waves and less of an annual basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone.
Jagadish Iyer: Rick, I have two questions. First, on -- you had a nice uptick in the patterning segment in the September quarter. What is the real driver for it, please?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Jagadish, this is Bren. So that was reticle inspection. And so we had a couple of tools that we booked in the quarter focused for -- on EUV development activities from captive mask shops.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to understand, now as EUV starts to make initial insertion next year, how should we think about the overall kind of the process control market given all the puts and takes about how multi-patterning could be changing at least in '18 and 2019? Any high-level thoughts here?
Richard Wallace: Sure. I think there are a couple of things to think about. The net of it all is we're not, at this point, capable of really seeing a big change in process control intensity, but it does move to different parts of our business. For example, right now we know there's even more pressure on wafer manufacturers for flatness for EUV. So there's an example where we'll get more. And what seems like perhaps unrelated, we also think that the Gen 5 application and adoption will be higher to support EUV print check but also initial production. There are fewer layers. So some of the films areas, we'll reduce -- the number of steps, we'll reduce, but there are new defect types. So right now when we model, we don't see a lot of difference in terms of overall capacity, and we have a number of flows that are what we believe the process flow would look like depending on the success of EUV. Where it will start to matter more and it's already impacting some is in reticle inspection, both with the Teron and then when we talk about later as we get to new capability 2019 for the gen -- or for the 5-nanometer and beyond, we'll see increase adoption as we go forward there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.
J. Ho: Maybe as a follow-up to the last question on EUV, given the lack of actinic inspection tools at least at the outset, is there the potential, as it goes to high-volume manufacturing, that you could see increasing intensity for optical inspection at least at the outset to offset the lack actinic inspection?
Richard Wallace: Patrick, no. I don't think so. I think that the high-volume, if it's done in the current generation of EUV will be served by the Teron platform. I think when we get to the high NA production for EUV, which will come at the sub-5 probably in maybe 2022, 2023 time frame, that's when there'll be a need for the EUV reticle tool, but also potentially actinic tools at that time frame. But we don't see a need for them before that. We think we're fully covering the market in the next few years with the toolsets that we have.
J. Ho: Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question in terms of China. You talked about some of the memory fabs that you guys are tracking and where you're seeing the activity already start in terms of process control buy. How do you look at, I guess, some of the logic and foundry fabs that are also starting to develop in China and some of the opportunity that even though it is going to be a little more mainstream and legacy nodes, what are some of the opportunities there for you given that even the 28-nanometer node does have high levels of process control intensity?
Richard Wallace: Well, we've already seen some of that, right, with established players. And they do invest and you have to, again, look at scale because those fabs tend to be bigger than the giga fabs elsewhere in the world for those nodes. So process control intensity, by that definition, is higher. We do see increased interest in those nodes. And those new facilities, of course, when they're greenfield and they're coming up, they don't have the option of reusing any other equipment, so we do see opportunity there. So we think that there will be continued opportunity. And initially, we didn't see, I'd say a year ago, so we weren't envisioning the memory that we're seeing now in China, but we actually were anticipating logic. So it's something we've been prepared for and even have, in some cases, restarted old lines to support them with products that are more appropriate for those design rules.
Bren Higgins: If I look at the mix -- yes, just one other comment. If I look at the mix for calendar '18, it looks like it's slightly more foundry weighted than memory. Calendar '17 was more memory weighted; '16 was foundry. So I would expect more foundry investment in '18 from that region, and that's the native China business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad: Just a question on the dividend. If I look at your dividend payout right now, it's somewhere around 30% to 32% for this year, next year earnings. And your long-term model, you've talked about 40% to 50% range. So how should we think about the dividend going forward? Are you planning to stick to the 40% to 50% range?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Farhan, it's a good question. I mean, clearly, we raised the dividend back in June, and we raised it almost 10%. Our model -- and the business has strengthened and the performance has been very strong. So clearly, we've outpaced that target. I mean, that's -- when we talk about that target being in that sort of 40% to 50% range, that's a 3-cycle target over time. We think about it that way because you're going to have periods you maybe under it when business is strong, but business [indiscernible] obviously want to build it to be able to not only just maintain it, but also raise it in weaker times. So over time, we target the growth rate of the total dividend payout versus the growth rate in earnings. And so if you look at our model right now where we see the top line growing 6% to 8%, we think we can grow the bottom line greater than 10% on that, that we'd grow the dividend payout in that greater than 10% range. So there's a couple different ways you can look at it. I mean, clearly, as the business continue to grow and we've raised it now with 6 or 7 years in a row. So this is a very consistent process on an annual basis, and we'll run through that process again as we complete our strategic planning process for the year.
Richard Wallace: And also, Farhan, as you can imagine, if there were a change in tax policy and we had access to more of that cash, we would revisit the payout ratio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur: Just kind of following up in terms of capital return. So it looks like you guys are going to get to your target gross debt level of $2.5 billion some time very soon. I think you guys are already at your target leverage ratio. So in a pretty short period of time, you're going to have a lot of strong excess free cash flow. You obviously have had a strategy of, number one, investing in the business; and then secondarily, a strong focus on capital return. So how do you guys think about uses for this excess free cash flow, i.e., something like turning on a stock repurchase program?
Bren Higgins: Well, so we started buying back some modest levels of stock a couple quarters ago. And you're right on all accounts, right? As we get through next quarter, we retire this note next month. We will be consistent with the commitments that we made back when we restructured the capital structure of the company back in 2014. So given the strength of the business, we're below our leverage levels. And so there is -- it's not necessarily a compelling reason for us to continue to delever. And we would redirect, I believe, in the shorter term towards share repurchase. Now there is the U.S. and offshore cash dynamic in terms of cash flow. And given the strength of some of our product lines, I think that our U.S. cash flow into next year is probably at the lower end of the 60% to 70% target range that we've referenced in the past.  But you're right, there will be some cash flow that will become available, and we'll run through our process. And first and foremost, we invest in our business, and we're doing that. And then secondly, as part of our -- capital structure is part of the company strategy. And so as we look at growth opportunities juxtaposed against shareholder return alternatives, it's part of our DNA and will be something that we will do. So I'll announce something when we have something.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you.
Theodore Lockwood: All right. Thank you, Christine. Thank you, all, for joining us today. This concludes our conference call. Have a wonderful rest of the day.

Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Ed. We're very pleased to report that June marked yet another exceptional quarter for KLA-Tencor, with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each finishing at or above the range of guidance. New orders exceeded the $1 billion mark for the second time in the past three quarters. Shipments were a record $971 million, and we ended June with backlog of $1.8 billion, which was also an all-time high level for the company. These numbers were once again driven by KLA-Tencor's ongoing market leadership, and strong execution of our strategic objectives, and are also reflective of the broad strength of today's overall WFE industry environment. One factor that may not be evident in the reported numbers, but which is key to our positive outlook for continued strength in the overall demand environment, is the growing momentum in orders we've experienced in the first half of calendar 2017. In fact, since January, we have adjusted K-T's internal order forecast for CY 2017 to the upside by almost 20%, reflecting strengthening customer demand, driven by new products across each of our end markets, and leading to another excellent year of growth the company in 2017, while setting the stage for continued momentum into 2018. Judging by the positive announcements recently of overall industry growth projections provided by our peers and other market participants, the strength KLA has experienced today is also broad based, which bodes well for the industry as we move ahead in the year. Turning now to a discussion of some of the areas of near-term focus for the company, as we execute our growth strategies. As the market leader in process control, K-T plays an enabling role in driving our customers' growth strategies and long-term success. We do this by investing at a high level to drive innovation and process control and supply our customers with the advanced inspection metrology products and services that they require to advance their device technology roadmaps, and also resulting in expansion of the serve market opportunity for KLA-Tencor in the most critical applications and process control. Along with the ongoing focus on investment and innovation, we're also continuously executing our strategies for operational excellence, and converting our growth and market leadership into industry-leading margins and cash flow, providing the fuel for future investment and resources for the ongoing strong cash returns to stockholders. Drilling down a bit on the factors that are driving KLA-Tencor's performance, I will focus on three key drivers of our growth. First, expansion of the serve market opportunity in memory, driven by new products. Today, we are developing five new technology platforms, two of which are targeted specifically at memory. And we're expecting higher process control adoption and record revenue, from memory customers in CY 2017. Growth from memory customers is already contributing to the record business levels we're experiencing in our bare wafer inspection and metrology markets, and we expect revenue from memory customers to continue to grow with the market. Second, growth in China, which, as seen by many, is the next major new market inflection for WFE. We believe China could represent a generational opportunity in terms of investment and growth for our industry. Business levels in China for KLA-Tencor are expected to more than double in CY 2017. China represents a tremendous growth opportunity for KLA-Tencor and for process control as our customers in this region are adopting process control at a high level to speed yield learning in their development efforts, and to accelerate market entry. And finally, services. Growth in the service business is historically driven by the expansion of our installed base of systems in the field. And this represents an annuity growth model to complement our systems business. Services growth is also driven by expanding investment in the trailing edge. This is resulting in legacy node fabs running at full utilization, and putting pressure on the equipment base to service, refurbish, remanufacture and upgrade process control systems as our customers continue to derive value from these assets. Quarterly service revenue topped $200 million for the first time in the June quarter. And we're modeling an annual revenue growth rate of 7% to 9% in services for the foreseeable future. To sum up today's results before I turn the call over to Bren, June was another record-setting quarter for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating that company is executing well in a strong industry environment. Given our backlog, and with the momentum we're experiencing the marketplace, 2017 is shaping up to be an outstanding year for us. We're delivering a steady cadence of leading products, expanding our served market, and delivering strong profitability and cash flows. We're growing our revenue with memory customers and we expect to see very strong growth in China, as customers view process control as a competitive advantage in their market growth strategy, and they look to KLA-Tencor as the market leader and partner. I'll now turn the call over to Bren for his comments. Bren?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the June quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments were a record $971 million, finishing above the range of guidance, and revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management in our engineering, manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was $939 million in the June quarter; GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62 in the quarter; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.64. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now, turning to highlights of the June quarter demand environment. Although we have discontinued guiding quarterly orders, beginning this quarter, we will begin to offer greater detail on our shipment results and guidance to provide more information and color on the current business environment to give investors insight into industry trends and KLA-Tencor's performance. For historical shipments mix data, please refer to the supplemental information posted with today's press release on our website. So as a reminder, the following details are related to shipments: total shipments in the June quarter were a record $971 million, up 7% on a sequential basis and finishing above the guidance range. Foundry was 64% of shipments in June, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development, and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry shipments to be approximately 42% of the total in the September quarter. Memory was 32% of shipments, with delivery evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling shipments to memory customers to be about 43% of the total in the September quarter, with NAND representing about half of the memory mix. Logic was 4% of shipments in June and is currently forecasted to be approximately 15% of the September quarter total. In terms of the approximate distribution of shipments by product group, wafer inspection was 50% of shipments; patterning was 25%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business. Non-semi, which includes our back inspection business, was approximately 4%; and service was 21% of shipments. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments to be in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels of $900 million to $1 billion, and we expect this trend to continue into calendar year 2018. This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January, consistent with the upside in orders we've experienced year-to-date. In fact, compared to the outlook we provided back at our earnings call in April, the CY 2017 order forecast is over $225 million higher than three months ago, and shipments for the second half of calendar year 2017 are expected to be up mid-single digits compared with the first half, inclusive of the stronger-than-guided performance in the June quarter. Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $939 million in June, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $910 million to $970 million in the September quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63%, in line with expectations for the quarter. The strong gross margin performance in June is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. Looking forward to the September quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% to 63.5%, flat at the midpoint compared with June, as we expect a similar mix of product revenue with slightly higher manufacturing costs, offset by an improved service mix quarter-to-quarter. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $238 million in June, and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.6%. This operating margin result is in line with the updated target model for annual revenue levels in the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion range as we outlined earlier in this quarter. We are modeling operating expense levels to be approximately $250 million in the September quarter due to increasing R&D head count and prototype material expense for current programs as well as approximately $2 million to $3 million of incremental operating expense associated with the acquisition of Zeta Instruments, a privately-held company that designs and manufactures optical profilers and defect inspection systems for the advanced wafer packaging, LED and data storage industries. We completed this small transaction in early June. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. We are modeling the September quarterly tax rate at 20% due to a non-recurring tax benefit expected in the quarter. However, you should continue to model a long-term tax rate of 22% going forward. Finally, non-GAAP net income for the June quarter was $259 million, and we ended the quarter with 158 million diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to the highlights and the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, an increase of $313 million compared with the March quarter. Cash from operations was a record $463 million in June, and free cash flow was $452 million. As mentioned earlier, we completed the acquisition of Zeta Instruments in the June quarter. Total purchase consideration was approximately $37 million, including cash paid of almost $32 million at closing. And finally, during the quarter, we paid an aggregate of $85 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in June reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customer's growth strategies at the leading edge and in legacy design rules and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.8 billion as of the end of the June quarter, position the company for another year of growth in a strong and stable overall WFE industry environment. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of our portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading edge, and our focus on operational execution across our business. With that, our guidance for the September quarter is: shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion; revenue between $910 million and $970 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.48 to $1.72 per share; as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.74 per share. This September quarter EPS guidance range assumes a 20% tax rate in the quarter. This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to the questions. We do once again request that you limit yourself to one question with one follow-up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to re-enter the call as time permits. All right, Christine, we are ready for the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding EUV and what trends you are seeing in the business there. ASML recently talked about potentially using single lithography edge, which I would assume would require a lot of inspection as well because there is no pattern inspection. So maybe the need for the wafer inspection is at a higher level? So maybe can you just talk about EUV trends that you're seeing in the business?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, Farhan, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. We do see a lot of work around EUV, still from our customers working in the pilot phase and the technology development phase. But a lot of work, whether it's in reticle qual, which is still something that – there's a lot of challenges getting defect-free reticles. And then in terms of lithography qualifications when they're testing out the litho cell. But as you know, we're ways off from production, so it's pretty hard to anticipate exactly what the production use cases are going to be. But we're certainly seeing an increased amount of interest at our customers and kind of continuing our belief that we'll see HBM by 2019 and 2020.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse: Got it. Rick, you mentioned that you guys are working on five new platforms and two of them in specific to memory. How should we be thinking about the ramp of these products? And are any of these products something that will affect the revenues in 2018?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: 2018, probably by the mid, later part of calendar year, we'll see some impact. I think we've talked before about I think about the overall increase in memory intensity. And I think if we look out, we're modeling about a 200 basis point increase in the intensity as we ramp these new products over the next couple of years. We'll already have a record for memory in calendar 2017, and we continue to see strength as we go forward.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, Farhan, it's Bren. I think the only thing I would add to that is we're still waiting for these products and that contribution. But we have from a 3D NAND perspective, from planar NAND, we have seen intensity improve. If you think about the peripheral products around their wafer inspection and in metrology, where wafer flatness is really, really critical to advance layer developments, 3D NAND, film measurements, CE measurement, laser scanning, opportunities around defect inspection. Some of the bigger challenges are still out there that these platforms hopefully will address. But we're encouraged by what we're seeing so far, and as Rick said, it's a big part of our calendar 2017 view.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse: Thank you. That's all I had.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and great job on the quarterly execution. As it relates to the financial model, if I look at your free cash flow generation for the quarter, it was -- was it 400 – what was it? Was it $452 million in free cash flow for the quarter? I am sorry if I missed that number.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, that's correct. It was pretty high. I mean, as you know, free cash flow can be pretty lumpy. But the linearity of shipments enabled our record collection quarter, so that was a big part of it this quarter. So we're real pleased with it and...
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's a 48% free cash flow margin. So maybe can you help us level set, Bren. So, in an environment where you're sort of operating sort of 36% to 38% operating margins, how do we think about the free cash flow margins underlying that?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, it's a great question and I think as our business has been so stable at these levels, we're not having to make significant investments in working capital. Obviously, we invested a lot in ramping inventory to prepare to be able to ship it, $900 million to $1 billion where we are today. And, so now you're seeing modest increases in inventory to support that activity. So then as a result of that, given our capital position and so on, we see a fair amount of the operating margin dropping through. So the way I think of – I mean, when I look at calendar 2017, I probably see free cash flow probably in excess of $1.1 billion, and we're talking about revenue levels of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion if you take our guidance and expectation around the December quarter. So you're in that 30th percentile ranges I think if I do the math quickly. So I think that's probably how we ought to think about it. I think if you see an inflection, obviously we'll have to invest into that. But the resiliency of the model is pretty strong. The margin profile of the business is good. And I think that a lot of the trends that I've outlined around gross margin is, I think, is fairly sustainable going forward. So, we feel pretty good about the model going forward, and the cash flow generation that comes from it.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then on China domestic memory, there are a number of programs that are going to start to put up either development lines or reproduction capabilities in 2018. You guys typically have a bit longer lead time. So I'm wondering, if you're just trying to see orders or at least tools showing up in your second half pipeline to support some of these early China-based memory programs? And as you've highlighted previously, China's spending intensity for process control, in general, tends to be a bit higher. And I'm just wondering, on these new memory programs, are you seeing that sort of higher spending intensity level?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Harlan. As we mentioned in the call, the orders, the new bookings for the quarter were very strong, driven in part by activity in China, as you say, in anticipation of having deliveries late calendar or maybe early in 2018. So yeah, we are seeing that. And agree with your suggestion, part of what we see overall in the strength of China going forward is broad participation across the board and these projects are absolutely real and they're backed with funding and we're pretty excited about the opportunity there.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Harlan, I think the only thing I'll add to that is, is that the first part of – well, all of 2016 and part of 2017 was very foundry-centric. We thought most of the memory bookings we would start to see in calendar 2018. And I think one of the things that we've been encouraged by, is the strength of what we've seen from an order perspective, both in the June quarter but also what's in the funnel over the next couple of quarters. So those are tools that are slotted to ship early in 2018. So from a shipment and revenue perspective, they're into next year. But as Rick said, those projects are clearly real and are moving quickly and we're preparing to ship into that in the first part of next year.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good to see the traction. Thank you.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, as you think about China and their emergence as a key spender here on equipment. Historically, you guys typically see roughly half your revenues early on around R&D and then half as you start to ramp. Curious if that's how you see spending patterns there or might it be different?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, I think that – it's not as much R&D, first to start with that. A lot of these are established processes. So I think we're seeing it maybe more pilot and then when you're talking about the ramp-up, they're not quite the same profile as you would have in maybe a more established company. Most of these are ramping trailing edge or not leading technologies. So a little bit smoother I think from that regard, but definitely front-end loading, the metrology capability just to be able to ramp the equipment. So for sure we're going to be one of the earlier ones to see it.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: And then, I guess, as they ramp, would you expect that ramp to be similar to what you see with non-domestic Chinese customers?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Probably a little stronger, simply because the scale of these fabs tends to be smaller. And I think from the standpoint of – on a relative basis, I think that you would see the concentration being higher. I mean, when our participation really slows is when you're talking some mega fabs that have got many, many years of experience. These fabs are newer and they're greenfield, so the ones we're dealing with right now. So I wouldn't expect it to fall-off the way it might have in a more traditional varied (24:34) giga fab.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: That's great. That's helpful. As a follow-up, as you think about calendar 2018, it looks like you're working from a backlog of seven months today. And other front-end guys, I presume including yourself have fairly good visibility into Q1. How are you thinking about the trajectory for revenues into 2018?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, C.J., I mean, it's a little early. But you're right. I mean, given the backlog position we have and what we expect in terms of the order outlook over the next six months, we'll see where WFE is. I think we've got a view that a lot of the dynamics that are driving the industry today continue into next year. Obviously, NAND flash will probably be a higher level of investment next year. China's probably bigger. DRAM is probably flat to a little bit lower. Foundry is probably on the margin a little weaker. So, I think as we look at all of that, we see sort of this continuation of these trends. And so we're sizing the company and modeling similar levels of output. So I don't think it's – right now, I'm not seeing anything that leads me to believe that it's not flattish or a little bit better than that.
C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Very helpful. Thanks, Bren.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International: Okay. Yeah. Thanks very much. I also wanted to ask about WFE spending. Last fall, it seemed like the industry wasn't contemplating anything more than $35 billion WFE through – really through next year. And today, we are on track to see more than $40 billion in spending in 2017. So basically you've seen, over the course of nine months, an incremental $5 billion-plus in WFE relative to what people were thinking back then. And I know that you, along with your peers, are positively biased for next year. But I guess my question is how do you get comfortable that the increase that we've seen so far over the last few quarters hasn't been borrowed from the future?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, that's a great question. I think a good way to think about it is where it's coming from. One of the biggest changes in the profile is relative to what's happening in China overall. And that investment is not really against leading edge. And so that's less about coming from the future and more about – it may affect some other people's trailing edge once it comes up and be a revenue battle for some of our customers. But it's kind of new capital. And we'd all heard about China's spending for many years. It just hadn't materialized. And now we're seeing a lot of those projects, so that's part one. The other part for us is the broad participation across the 7-nanometer and 10-nanometer of logic in the foundry space. And so that's a little bit different too, and just a bigger commitment to that node than we saw in the last cycle. But, of course, there's a cyclicality associated with these businesses. So I think there'll be ebbs and flows. For example, NAND probably softens in 2018 because of all the capacity that's coming on or at least stays flat.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International: And your backlog, I thought C.J. mentioned it was like seven months. Is that – I mean, is that pretty locked in? What portion of that is actually cancelable?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, I mean, normally our business runs – it's a little bit harder now, because the order strength over the last couple of quarters has been pretty significant. I mean, we've had two out of three quarters over a $1 billion. So we'll start to ship down on that. I mean, we generally run between five and six months. I guess, any of the backlog – I mean, what customers do, they don't usually cancel. What they do is they push, right? That's usually the indication. You'll see them start to push orders out. And then at some point then they'll start to convert those to newer versions of the products they had as they get ready to receive those tools. But if you look at what's loaded in the factory, I would characterize the environment as customers generally pulling to get the tools quickly. And so far, we feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing. And as we – we spend a lot of time looking at indicators and all the different things that are out there. And...
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International: Sure.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: ...we feel pretty good about the underlying fundamentals of what we're seeing today. And a lot of what's going on in China is, I'm not sure it's really contributing to the global sort of supply-demand dynamics, at least at this time. And so that's future investment for the long run. And so, I don't think that, that necessarily worries us from an overheating perspective at least early on.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International: Okay. And if I could just sneak in one more, you talked – Rick talked about NAND and foundry logic. How does DRAM fit into the 2018 equation?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, as we were saying, I mean, DRAM has bounced back this year from 2016 when – the leader didn't invest a lot in 2016, so we've seen some investment. I think, you know, look – it looks like it's in undersupply. So I don't think DRAM is going to be up as we move into next year. Maybe it's flat, maybe it's down a little bit. I don't see it changing a lot, but hard to see how it's up a lot from where it's at right now, at least, just generally how we see it.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. I had a follow-up on China as well. Unless I heard you incorrectly, Rick, I think you talked about your Chinese business in calendar 2017 doubling year-over-year. I was wondering if that included some of the multinationals spending or was that a pure local number. And if you can talk a little bit about the preliminary outlook into 2018 for your China business, that'll be helpful.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. The doubling we're referring to is native Chinese investment. We also have the multinational, but we're talking about what's going on there. And in terms of 2018, if you think about some of the ordering we're seeing as for the first phase, what these customers will tell you is, there's a subsequent phase planned. So we think that China continues to be strong as we go forward into 2018. But whether or not – internally, we discount the numbers that we've heard in CapEx from China over the next five years, and it's still pretty strong. If you even discount them in half, based on what some of these players are saying they're going to do.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. And then as a follow-up, I had a question on your bare wafer inspection business. I appreciate it's not necessarily a big part of your business today, but if and when some of your customers decide to expand capacity, I think it could be a pretty nice business for you guys, given the gross margin profile. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing today from those customers and what their outlook is in the second and potentially the 2018? Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Sure. Yeah, no, it's actually – it is an important business for us. It's a strong business. And not only that, what we're seeing is, demand both from wafer manufacturers, but also from customers – IC customers who are qualifying tools for ramps. It is an important part of the business. It is part of the uptick, and we're seeing in orders and it will come in revenue, as we go through. So it has been strong, and that's both for defect and also for flatness. So it's an important part of our story going forward.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Rick, the last time you saw this kind of really surge in sustained business was when the 28-nanometer node rolled out. Maybe a two-part question there. Do you believe, based on your customer conversations, that the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer node will be as large as 28-nanometer? And secondly, can you – given the strength that you've seen in the last few quarters, what is the capital intensity change or increase from 28-nanometer to the 10-nanometer/7-nanometer?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Great question. I think that first part of that answer is there certainly is a lot of broad investment for the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. What's interesting about it, though, if you unpack a lot of our orders, the strength in our orders is really not as much from 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, as it is what we're seeing in memory, and some of the other segments that we're in. So it is strong but we haven't actually seen the same kind of surge we saw in 28-nanometer as we're seeing and 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. That said, it's pretty broad right now. And we think they're at least three, maybe four players that are going to be involved in that that we'll see going forward. We are hearing from customers they think the size is going to be similar. But it's still early for 7-nanometer. And right now, what we're seeing is pretty intense investment around the 10-nanometer node.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And maybe as my second question, in terms of the services business, where we've also seen the revenue ramp over the last few quarters, given the process control isn't like a process tool like edge, that basically eats itself up, what type of offerings or what type of solutions are you offering customers in the services end that will help grow that business to that 7% to 9% growth rate you talked about?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Patrick, it's Bren. It is a different business than our process tool peers. And so what you typically have is – so 75% of that revenue stream is contract, right? So we have customers that buy service contracts with different levels of coverage across either certain tools or broadly across a fab. And so most of that revenue is repeatable, and it allows us to test and right-size those fabs to maintain good utilization, but also to get pretty good predictably about part failure and so on. But what we end up selling is, we replace parts, right? And so, then there's parts and as those parts fail over time, and you have lasers that have lives, useful lives and so on, so that's really the biggest part of the business. But it isn't traditional break and fix and that – it's billable. It's really contract. So it really works for us and works for customers, because we can keep the tools up and keep them optimized and run preventative maintenances, and those kinds of checks on them over time to keep them running, and it works out on both ends.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: One of the other things is the decay rate. You think about service contracts on tools and how long you service them, part of what's happened is people are keeping them in production longer. So if you think about fully utilized, older generation fabs that for many of our customers are just printing money, because they're fully depreciated. The tool life is longer than we expected, which means the decay rate on the back end is slower, which is part of the contributor to the growth, because you have stuff coming in and you don't have us much stuff coming out, and that's really the benefits we're seeing from IoT.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, first question, I want to try and get an update in terms of your view about Gen 5. We talked about it before. And I think right now you talked about mostly it still being used on rebuild. How do you kind of think about that go into production? Will we still have to wait until 5-nanometer or is EUV (36:35) the big kicker for that? If you can give some color around that.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, the good news is, we're kind of doing what we wanted to do with Gen 5 in terms of we are having broad shipments across a number of customers. And we're – basically on a one a month shipment rate. And so we continue to do that. I think the time when we would ramp that up is when we'd see it going into larger scale production. So there are some customers that are talking about production for it, but it's a limited number of layers. And when that happens, then we'll see multiple tools. But right now, we're seeding the market. We're penetrating the market. It's a tricky supply chain situation, so we're keeping it at one a month right now, as we go forward and we'll ramp up. It's hard to say. Preliminary results are good. There is a lot of use cases for customers. But we stick to what we said before, where we think it really is a tool that ramps into production out a couple of years, high volume really when EUV is kicking in, so you'd say, 2019, 2020.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Actually, that's helpful color. And then, on the server side, I have a question actually. So, one of your peers or some of the company in the supply chain, right, they would charge customer or they'll write a contract with a customer where they do almost a yield base or performance-based contract with the customer. For example, I think Sima (38:01) used to do that. So I'm just curious, is that something that you guys entertain? Or is within the 75% of your services in same contract, are you guys starting to look at doing that in your service contract? Or is it still mostly fixed type of contract?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So, we have a lot of key metrics that we agree to with customers, largely around availability of the tools and response time in service. And so we've historically done that. And, of course, as these tools become more mission-critical for our customers, that's part of the arrangement that we have. So when it comes to extending the life and working very hard to make sure we don't disrupt production, we already do that. That is part of the benefit that customers have from going contract. There are things we're doing to enhance the business, we talked about in the last question. And some of them have to do with older fabs, where we continue to offer enhancements to the tools. A lot of tools have been in market for a long time, have upgrades available for customers, and we'll continue to offer those as we go forward. So I'd say we already have that as part of the offering.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick. First, historically, September quarter has been a weak one for you guys, but you have a very strong guidance. So the question is, are there any greenfields that are driving that? And as a part of the question is that, can you provide some color on how many greenfields you have for this year, and are there any thoughts on for next year? And then I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yes, Jagadish, it is a little atypical to see the strength in September compared to the last few years. So we're encouraged by that. I don't have the actual number in front of me. I think we'll be shipping a fair amount – the second half has a fair amount of memory mix of shipments. There is obviously some additional 10-nanometer investment on the foundry that's shipping as well. So most of the China stuff, which is greenfield, is not shipping for a little while. So, I guess, that's how I'd characterize the shipment profile next quarter. But as I said in the prepared remarks, strong and stable. And we see a second half shipment profile that's up a little bit versus the first half, so evenly weighted across the year. It's probably more memory centric in the second half of the year versus what we saw in the first half.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, one other interesting attribute of our business environment – we looked at this recently – the concentration from the top customers is actually down. We actually have broader customers. When we look at the top 10, the percent they make up of the business has decreased in this calendar year. It was slightly down last year and we anticipate that broadening. So the good news is, I think we have more customers in more locations and more offerings for them.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Okay. Excellent. And just as a follow-up, you talked about, Rick, in your prepared remarks about new products and particularly for the memory segment. Hypothetically, if we assume that WFE is up, say, 5% for next year, would it be fair to say that you could outperform WFE, as these new products start to bear fruit? Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Actually, I'll let Bren take that one.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. I mean one thing about next year is, it looks like next year's WFE mix is a little more memory-centric. And as you know, the process control intensity in memory, while it is getting better, isn't near foundry. So $1 billion of WFE depending on the segment is not created equal for us. But we've seen some improvement on the memory said, which we're encouraged by. I think these new products, given the timing of when they'll ship and go to market, and we'll actually start to see revenue given the valuation process and so on, I think in the second half of the year, we might see some revenue, but I think it will be a pretty small amount. But as I look at our plans for next year, I look at the funnel, I don't see any reason why KLA shouldn't grow in line with – at least in line with the market, as we move into 2018.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Congrats on a solid execution.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open.
Atif Malik - Citigroup: Thanks for taking my question. And, Rick, good job in kind of refocusing KLA on memory in China after the merger breakup. My question is on 3D NAND yields. Can you help us understand where the 3D NAND yields are on Gen 1 NAND, that 48-layer, just kind of blended across – for guide, and where the yields are on the second generation, 64-layer NAND? And is there a reason to believe that there's something structural about migration from 48-layer to 64-layer to 96-layer which will keep the yields kind of low for a sustainable period of time?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, as you know, one of the biggest challenges is one of the ones we're trying to address, which is the ability to catch defects in the process. So as a result, when customers have process problems, they have to go through some pretty rigorous engineering analysis to unpack those problems. So you see two things. One, you see actual wafer yield as sometimes probably – it is averaging lower than what you would see on 2D. And it's probably depends on customers, somewhat, how that is, but it is lower. But it's still pretty good. And you see that because they're having success selling them commercially. But the other thing is, you see line yield bus, (43:55) which is a little different, which is when you have a number of wafers that are actually bad, and have to be scrapped, and for many customers, that's very disruptive to their business. So I'd say that, yes, structurally, it's very hard to build these – especially as you're going up in layers, the devices, for two reasons. One, the process technology is very tricky. And the second one, you don't have a lot of visibility into it. And it's kind of like the old days of semiconductor manufacturing, when we didn't have as much in line, and people had to use disruptive means or short loops to try to figure out what was wrong with their process. So there is opportunity. I think we've repeatedly said that, if we could help with solutions that help customers gain a few points of yield, that's easily justifiable on their end. But I would say, yields are in the range of probably, if you'd see them over 90% in 2D, you'd see similar yields at, say, 10 points lower, say 80% or so for – and maybe they are even higher than 90% in 2D, so you'd see a degradation as you go to the 3D.
Atif Malik - Citigroup: Very helpful. As a follow-up, the bifurcation in leading edge foundry versus lagging edge is expanding. UMC cut its CapEx and decided to actually focus on the lagging edge. So when you're talking to the Chinese domestic foundry customers, are they asking for 28-nanometer equipment or they're asking for the latest 10-nanometer, 40-nanometer equipment?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: It varies. I mean, they definitely have ambitions to advance nodes down the road. So you do see some interest in the advanced and you'll see customers doing, in that case, in the foundries, some R&D, or at least some of them doing some. But by and large, it's the older tool sets because they do have capital costs to manage and they've got to try to hit the cost per wafer targets that everybody else has. But you do see some interest in the advanced. And they also want to have a path and a road map. The good news relative to our equipment is have upgrades available on things like our Gen 4 wafer inspection, as an example, where we can continue to add value to a tool set that they buy.
Atif Malik - Citigroup: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you.

Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Ed, and thank you, all, for joining us today for our March 2017 Earnings Call. I plan to briefly cover three things with you in my prepared remarks today before handing off to Bren. First, a quick look at KLA-Tencor's outstanding performance in March followed by a look at highlights of the very strong market share performance delivered by the company in 2016, and then concluding with an updated outlook for industry growth for KLA-Tencor in 2017. Let's begin with the March quarter. KLA-Tencor delivered excellent results in March, thanks to another outstanding performance by our employees in executing the company's growth strategies in what is a very exciting and dynamic period for the company and for the semiconductor industry as a whole. March shipments, revenue, and diluted GAAP and non GAAP earnings per share all came in above the mid-point of our range of guidance with shipments finishing at a record $909 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced strength across our inspection and metrology portfolio with growth in market leadership metrics for the March quarter continuing the momentum we achieved in calendar year 2016 and highlighting by the quarter record for our unpatterned wafer inspection products. Working in close collaboration with leading global semiconductor device manufacturers, KLA-Tencor's strategies are focused on ensuring our customers' success. This effort is helping to address the most complex manufacturing challenges for inspection and measurement in the marketplace today in both development and capacity monitoring applications. These challenges include patterning and process window issues associated with EUV and multi-patterning lithography and as the industry moves to smaller dimensions and three-dimensional structures to address cost, power, and device performance improvements. Our successful execution of these strategies continues to bear fruit in terms of market leadership and relative outperformance of KLA-Tencor. In fact, the recent market share numbers from Gartner show the overall process control segment grew 11% in 2016 or roughly in line with WFE industry growth in the year. In that period, total revenue for KLA-Tencor grew 14% and systems revenue grew 18%. The 2016 share data also shows KLA-Tencor increased our market leadership in process control by about 300 basis points in the year, reflecting our focus on market and technology innovation in the most critical applications in inspection and metrology, as well as the breadth of our product and services portfolio. We saw a particular strength in 2016 from optical wafer inspection. Recent successful new product introductions in this flagship market for KLA-Tencor including the launch of the new Gen 5 broadband plasma platform, plus strong customer acceptance of the Gen 4 platform for a leading-edge capacity monitoring and successful new offerings in laser scanning patterned wafer inspection as well as unpatterned wafer inspection, together contributed to expansion of the total available market for process control and growth in KLA-Tencor's share of the process control market in 2016. The story for metrology in 2016 was highlighted by the growth in optical CD metrology, which is the preferred technology for an increasing number of CD metrology applications. Optical CD is playing an enabling role in the proliferation of advanced 3D device architectures and leading-edge memory and logic, measuring not only line widths but also profile features on the chip. The robust market share and relative growth delivered by KLA-Tencor in 2016 are the results of continued successful execution of product and service strategies that address the most complex inspection and measurement challenges in today's marketplace. And through that, KLA-Tencor is helping to drive growth in innovation in a period of solid sustained performance for the semiconductor industry. Turning to the overall industry environment for calendar 2017, as March results have indicated across the board, the investment landscape in each of the major customer end markets today are solid and broadly based, supporting a growth outlook for the overall WFE industry that's expected to be in the mid-single-digits or higher in 2017. Given the momentum in demand demonstrated in the March quarter results and with upside to the original industry growth estimates for the year coming from a broadening of the competitive landscape in 10- and 7-nanometer foundry, we now see WFE growth favoring the upper end of the initial range of our estimates for 2017 and our preliminary view of the 2018 industry landscape points to a continuation of these investment trends. Given a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage and ranks KLA-Tencor in the top tier of leading semiconductor companies and coupled with leadership position in each of the most critical process control markets, the March quarter results show that the stage is set to build on the momentum of calendar 2016 and deliver what we plan to be a year of double-digit revenue growth in 2017 for KLA-Tencor. Now turning to guidance for the June quarter, shipments are expected to be in a range of $890 million to $970 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be in a range of $885 million to $945 million with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share. And I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the March quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments, revenue, and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the midpoint of the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio as well as solid execution in cost management and our manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was $914 million in the March quarter, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61 in the quarter and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.62. In our press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to highlights of the March quarter demand environment. Although we are no longer guiding quarterly orders, for the time being, we will continue to share our perspective on the current end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends in KLA-Tencor's performance. Upon completion of an upgrade of our internal analysis systems, our plan is to begin providing end market mix detail for shipment results and guidance beginning in September quarter. At that time, all end market customer mix, business segment, and regional breakdowns will be provided on a shipment basis and we will discontinue all formal order commentary including disclosure of the quarterly results. But for now, for the March quarter, new orders were $990 million. Foundry was 54% of new system orders in March, driven by an anticipated broadening of the customer base for investment in 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. We are currently modeling foundry orders to be approximately 50% of the total in the June quarter. Memory was 42% of new orders, with investment evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We are currently modeling memory orders to be about 40% of the total in the June quarter, with NAND representing about 60% of the memory mix. Logic was 4% of new system orders and is currently forecasted to be approximately 10% of the June quarter total. In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of calendar 2017; wafer inspection was 56% of new orders; patterning was 21%, patterning includes orders from our reticle inspection business; non-semi was approximately 3%; and service was 20% of total orders. Total shipments were a record $909 million in the quarter, finishing above the $890 million midpoint of guidance for March. Looking forward, we are modeling June quarter shipments to be a new record at the midpoint of guidance and be in a range of $890 million to $970 million. Current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels in excess of $900 million and we expect this trend to extend at least through the second half of the calendar year. This outlook has strengthened since the earnings call back in January. Current expectations are for second half of 2017 shipments to be up mid-single-digits versus the first half of the calendar year. Turning now to the income statement, revenue was $914 million in March, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $885 million to $945 million in the June quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.5%, in line with expectations for the quarter. The strong gross margin performance in March is consistent with recent margin trends in terms of mix of product business and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. Compared to the December quarter, the benefit of the incremental sequential revenue was offset by a less favorable product mix in the period. Looking forward to the June quarter, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 62.5% and 63.5%, up about 50 basis points at the midpoint versus the March quarter, due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter. As we highlighted last quarter, going forward, we expect to deliver gross margin results a couple hundred basis points above our 2015 published business model targets due to a number of factors, including customer reception of new product offerings, more efficient new product introduction execution, and improved variable cost management in service and manufacturing operations. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $224 million in March, up about $3 million compared with December and non-GAAP operating margin was 38%. We are modeling operating expense levels of between $234 million and $238 million in the June quarter due to higher compensation expenses and prototype materials expenses for current programs. For calendar 2017, we are modeling operating expenses to be around $950 million due to incremental investments in product road maps supporting 3D NAND and EUV inspection and metrology opportunities as well as higher variable compensation expense. Given our gross margin expectations, we expect to continue to deliver operating margins solidly above our published model for the foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter, just below our previously guided long-term planning rate of 22%, reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products developed or manufactured offshore and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. You should assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes. Finally, net income – non-GAAP net income for the March quarter was $256 million and we ended the quarter with 158 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll now turn briefly to highlights on the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $111 million compared with the December quarter. Cash from operations was $225 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $215 million. In March, we paid an aggregate of $86 million of regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and made a supplemental payment of $25 million towards our outstanding term loan. We expect to continue executing our delevering commitments over the remainder of the calendar year, consistent with our leverage targets. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor's results in March reflect our market leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customer's growth strategies at the leading-edge and in legacy design rules, and our industry-leading business model. This, fueled by record total backlog of $1.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, position the company for another year of greater-than-market growth and an overall WFE industry environment that is currently forecasted to grow mid-single-digits or higher in calendar year 2017. This performance demonstrates the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of the portfolio of solutions addressing the most critical yield requirements of leading-edge, and our operational core competencies. With that, to summarize, our guidance for the June quarter is: shipments in the range of $890 million to $970 million; revenue between $885 million and $945 million; and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.44 per share to $1.64 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.46 per share to $1.66 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. Ed?
Ed Lockwood - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, I'd like to open up the call up to Q&A. And we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow-ups and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to follow up in today's call as time permits. All right, Christine, we're ready for your first question.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Bren, I just wanted to ask you about maybe as you think about updating your model. Everyone else is coming out with these financial models that are tied to WFE. And it looks pretty obvious that this year, WFE, you guys aren't quite as high, but if you look at the other guys, they're thinking like high, high 30s, maybe $39 billion. So it seems like $40 billion is now sort of like the new norm almost. So I'm wondering, can you give us a sense of what EPS would be in a new model at a $40 billion WFE? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, Tim, we haven't published a new model so it's a little bit difficult for me to answer that in terms of different WFE levels. I mean, I think the way you have to work through that is, as I've said around the revenue performance from an operating margin perspective, I think we're operating a couple hundred basis points better than what we have published before. But the easiest way to model that is if you're talking about in nearer term, and I think it's important assumption, are we talking now or a year from now and so on? But if you're just thinking in nearer term a $40 billion environment, you'd have to think about process control intensity on that. And I think in calendar 2016, process control intensity was below 13 percentile, so somewhere between 13% and 14%. The mix of business would be a factor in that. Market share was Gartner just reported 51%. We've got internal objectives to gain share at least a point of share a year over the next few years so that's certainly a factor there. And then our service business, which is currently – would be somewhere around $800 million into calendar 2017. So if you put all that together with the operating margin, I suggest that I think you can probably work your way to an EPS result.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Awesome. Thanks. And then I guess, Rick, a question for you. So there's a lot of concerns that have actually gotten a lot of questions recently about some perception that there's a lot of reuse between 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer. I guess it sort of ignores all the investment that still has to be made at 10-nanometer. But can you talk about that? I guess it comes down to how much backfill there is on 10-nanometer. But can you talk about that from like a high level? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Absolutely, Tim. I think the biggest issue associated with 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer is the number of design starts that there are that are ultimately going to land at 7-nanometer. And 7-nanometer is a much more significant node than what we saw with 20-nanometer going to 16-nanometer, so therefore we don't see reuse as being as significant, mainly because there's going to be such an expansion in the overall capacity. So we think that will drive our intensity and it'll be more like what we saw with the 28-nanometer node. When you combine 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, it'll look more like that. So we feel pretty good about how that is playing out. Not only that, you have multiple players in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer race, so you've got broad industry support, a number of foundries all competing for that as there are increased starts.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking my question. My question is regarding the OpEx increase in second half of the year. Can you just talk about, what exactly are you investing? And you touched a little bit upon EUV opportunities, and I just want to understand, like, is there something new that you're doing in that area or just accelerating some of the programs that you had there?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Farhan. Thanks. It's a good question. So there is some acceleration, I would call it incremental investment. We think there are opportunities for us on the inspection side. Well, frankly, metrology side as well for driving more process control into 3D NAND. And so there are a number of efforts in the company that are focused on that. There is also work that we're doing to enable EUV development activities. And so there's work there. Finally, the industry has strengthened, certainly the company performance has strengthened. So there's some variable comp dynamics that are part of that. And so when you add it all up, it looks like it's about $20 million higher for the year than what I was suggesting back in January. But our outlook has strengthened as well. So I think if you look back January versus today, we're probably in excess of $200 million of incremental revenue to where we see things today. And so if you follow our traditional drop-through model of operating margin, it's an incremental $20 million or so on costs. So it fits our model and we see it as an opportunity to invest in some of these big opportunities, we think, that will help drive process control intensity into 2018 and 2019.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. And then, Rick, you talked about 2018 outlook looking positive at this stage. Can you maybe touch on some of the product drivers that give you confidence of some growth in 2018?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Sure. I think that as you look out into 2018, what you see is that the investment timeframe that'll include work on the 5-nanometer, so as you get to later in the year, and then continued expansion in addition to additional capacity being brought on by the guys who aren't in the lead in the 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, so that's really from the foundry standpoint. Memory, you have continued investment going on kind of across the board. And our process control intensity is strengthening in memory so we see continued drive from that. And, of course, we've all talked about the investment that's going on in China. So right now it looks pretty good and our customers are certainly excited about their prospects as we go forward.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. That's all I had.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question, I imagine you have a pretty good view today in terms of the capital intensity as we migrate down to 7-nanometer and would love to hear your thoughts on what that intensity looks like from process control vis-à-vis 10-nanometer or 14-nanometer, whichever is easier as a compare for you?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, so, C.J., it's Bren. I mean, as we look to calendar or we look at 7-nanometer, I mean, 7-nanometer has a full shrink. You're shrinking in the front-end. You also have your shrinking in back-end in transistor wiring. So we think that that coupled with the multi-patterning schemes, the process integration structures that customers are doing with these new materials in the back-end will create a number of process window challenges, we think, will be good for our business. As we move into 7-nanometer, we have a number of new products that'll come out that customers will be able to try to address some of these technology challenges but also drive cost of ownership. So I think process control intensity per wafer goes up somewhere in that 20-ish percent range or so. Obviously, the number of wafer starts ultimately over time and design starts will be a factor in that because lots of designs change how customers invest. But how we're looking at it now is I think that to Rick's earlier comments, I mean, reuse will be limited. And I think the new product introductions plus the technology road map will be a good driver for our business.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Very helpful. And I guess as my follow-up, if you make the assumption that your revenues and market grows in calendar 2018, will the OpEx uptick we just saw be temporary or will that continue? Will you continue to invest given the heightened revenues? And this is just investments, not including the increase in variable comp.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, the variable comp will adjust, right? So that's one factor that will play out as we move into 2018. I think the easiest way for you to think about modeling the company is back to the model that we had put out, we're targeting an operating margin level based on certain revenue targets. And we're exceeding the published model because of the strengths in gross margin, which we believe are sustainable. And so that's what's driving the outperformance. So as revenue grows, we will invest. And I think that as I outlined earlier, I think there's a lot of opportunities out there and so we'll invest in those. But we're committed to the operating model and that's how you got to think about it.
C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid results and on the outlook. Last call, you guys talked about the potential for shipments to be slightly down second half versus first half. Now you're expecting second half to be up by mid-single-digit percentage points. So maybe you can just help us understand what's driving the better second half view. Is it foundry, logic, 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer? Or is it memory? Is it legacy China? Is it a combination of all of the above?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren, and thank you for the comment. It really is more of an all-of-the-above statement. Certainly, logic, foundry into the second half of the year has strengthened it terms of the shipment profile. And we certainly saw that versus where we were in January. So now it looks like it's up a little bit and it's been really filling out in the December quarter. So we feel pretty good about that. I think in China we continue to be surprised by the customer pull that we see from those customers, so that's a factor in it as well. But I think all segments right now are investing and are putting a lot of pressure on us in terms of quick delivery. So I think the good thing about the upside we're seeing is it's quick orders and quick deliveries which will enable us to drive some revenue performance in the second half. But that's basically what's driving it. And I think finally the only other thing is that the order profile, so you look at the backlog that we're bringing into the year, the order result March, what we expect to be a book-to-bill greater than 1 in June. So we've got a fair amount of sort of backlog or runway in terms of what we see coming and how to scale and plan the factory through the second half of the year.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Just add to that, Harlan, I think one of the things that changed in the last three months is we were anticipating but not convinced that there was going to be this broad support for the 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer across multiple customers. And we see a lot more evidence of that now, so that really has strengthened the foundry side of the equation, to Bren's point, driving all those things. So it was a good quarter from that regard.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great insights. Thank you for that. Recently on the memory side, we were talking to the CTOs of one of your large 3D NAND memory customers. And when we asked him about his equipment spending intensity going from 2D to 3D, he's saying that most of his buys are three areas: number one, deposition; number two, etch; number three, metrology. And this was for 32-layered 3D. They're transitioning to 64-layered now and still saying that metrology tool buys are a very high priority. So I know that you guys have been wanting to collect more data on this but it seems that on the metrology side, whether it's overlay, film thickness measurements, CD, whatever, that your metrology intensity for 3D is increasing pretty dramatically over 2D. So, first of all, are you seeing this sort of higher metrology intensity on 3D versus your prior assumptions? And is there any way to quantify that?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Harlan, yes. So, I mean, the metrology side has been pretty healthy. The concern we had was actually on the other side and the defectivity side being lower intensity. And we're seeing that strengthen. And that's relatively early just due to the offerings that we have. But I think that was the area where we think there is more upside because of all of the work that people have to do to do disruptive tests. And as the complexity increases, there's more opportunity. So we do think the intensity goes up. And I think that if you look at planar, overall process control intensity for planar versus 3D, they're actually pretty comparable now and likely more upside to that as we go forward.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on gross margins. You're guiding Q2 gross margins to 62.5% to 63.5%, which continues to be a pretty strong level above levels we had seen two, three years ago. Is this kind of the new normal for the company and we should expect this to be a sustainable gross margin number or going forward should we expect kind of a reversion to the 59% to 60% range?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. It's a good question and really, we're seeing benefit in a lot of places. I mean, we're seeing improving margin profiles in service, we're seeing improving margin profile across products. New product introduction execution has been very strong in terms of how you manage from transitioning from one product to another. And at these revenue levels, I think the scaling of our factory and the leverage that exists in that has all been good. So I don't envision a drop-off like you described. I mean, certainly, at these revenue levels, I think as I guided, I thought calendar 2017 was 62 plus or minus 50 basis points. I think we're probably at the higher end of that guidance range now as we look into next year. And I don't see anything on the horizon that suggests that this profile will change going forward. So we feel pretty good about it. And as I said earlier, I think what's driving how we're looking at our operating model and performance of various revenue levels is not so much about what we're spending, but how much more gross margin we think we're going to generate from our revenue.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then I had a follow-up on the wafer side of things. I think it's been about a decade since the Shin-Etsus and the SUMCOs and the Filtronics have expanded capacity in a meaningful way. And we hear more and more about very tight wafer supply these days. Just curious have you had preliminary talks with your customers about potentially expanding capacity or are they still very disciplined and still 12 to 18 months out before they make a meaningful change in their capacity plans? Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, we have ongoing conversations with them as they are – we're critical suppliers to them. And there has been levels of investment for technology capability on a routine basis. But we have seen expansion recently and 2017 looks like it's going to be a very good year overall relative to capacity in support of increased capacity demands. So that business is part of the strength that we're seeing.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: So the only thing I'll add to that is that in our unpatterned inspection business, we had a record year in FY 2016 and we just had a record quarter in that business in the March quarter from an order perspective. Now some of that is 3D NAND because 3D NAND is driving unpatterned inspection. They basically use these tools to monitor the deposition equipment to ensure cleanliness and so on, but also the wafer activity is a part of that. And I think that's starting and we expect to see that growing a little bit over time here and it'll be a nice tailwind as we progress through this year.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thank you and congratulations. I think there's been this perception or there was at least, as memory spending grew as a percentage of WFE, KLAs revenue growth would underperform. That's kind of the trend that we saw in 2014 and 2015. But more recently, the revenue performance has been substantially better in spite of pretty healthy memory spending. I can't say I appreciate what's the difference this cycle. And if you could talk maybe a little bit about if DRAM continues to grow as a percentage of WFE, how does KLA do in that environment?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, there's really two things. One, what we saw in the period you referred to where it was underperforming – where we underperformed, I think the other thing that happened in addition to the mix shifting quite fast toward memory. You also had a lot of reuse happening, so it was kind of a combination of factors that played against us. What we have now is expansion of capacity continuing in foundry. Foundry continues to be reasonably strong. Less reuse, more players in our memory process control intensity going up over time, and then some other factors like the last conversation we just had like the OEMs and the wafer manufacturers investing. So really a broad customer base. On top of all that, we have China, where the process control intensity tends to be higher overall because these are smaller projects. So we have a lot of factors working in our favor that are supportive of our revenue growth performance.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So is it fair, Rick, to say that you're sort of agnostic to the mix of WFE?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Not agnostic. We have a much higher percentage of adoption in foundry than we do in memory. But unless there is a major shift in terms of the relative performance, we believe we'll continue to perform in line or better than the industry as we go forward.
Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So recently one of (34:57) your customer and I think we've heard from other people as well that there's talk about shrinking from 20-nanometer to 22-nanometer rather than moving down to 14-nanometer and then 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, right? And how would that benefit or affect your business? Do you expect that shrink to drive increased process improvement?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I'm sorry from 28-nanometer to 22-nanometer, is that what you said?
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Yeah.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Sure. I mean, any time there is any kind of shrink going on, there tends to be increased demand for, especially in the wafer side, wafer inspection side for finding smaller defects. So that will drive it. But you're talking about a relatively small part of our overall market. So you wouldn't see as big a change as you would in a node shift down to 7-nanometer, for example, if that makes sense. But sure, any of those trends are good, and especially when the fabs – from our standpoint, if it's the smaller fab doing it, the relative process control intensity is higher just because of where they are on the yield curve and on the volume curve, if that makes sense.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Actually that's helpful color there. And then on your guidance outlook, I think you've talked about a logic order picking up this quarter. Is this kind of renewal resumption of spending by the logic guys or was it just a kind of one-quarter timing of things?
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. I think when you look across the year, our view on logic spending in 2017 versus 2016 is relatively flat, so I think it's a quarterly dynamic more than anything. So, yeah, I think it's just – we got orders that are going to get placed and numbers a little bit higher next quarter.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Hi, Rick and Bren. Congrats on the results and the guidance. I just had a follow-up question on WFE spend from China. In China, we are continuing to see satellite pictures of some of these big domestic China fabs making pretty good progress constructing their shelves. How impactful do you think domestic China WFE will be this year for pilot line equipment? Thanks.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, when you look at our order profile, I mean, it was so what we saw in 2016 and what we expect to see in 2017 for the most part is foundry-centric. And so it was roughly 15% of foundry orders in 2016 and maybe 25% of foundry orders in 2017. I think what's interesting is while the memory investment from a shipment perspective is more of an 2018 and beyond dynamic, we are starting to see memory orders show up in the funnel. And so as we look, I'm not sure exactly when we'll see those orders booked, whether we'll see them booked in June or whether we will see them booked in September. But they are for shipments in early 2018. And so your question about progress on the facilities is a good one, and so far as we monitor that and we begin to staff up in anticipation of supporting these ramps, these are factories we watch pretty closely. But right now, there's a lot of activity there and we're chasing trying to hire people and ramp up to be able to support those customers in a pretty diverse fab footprint overall across the country.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bren. And then a follow-up question on the market share gains that KLA saw last year. Do you get the sense that customers were waiting for KLA's new products last year and the strong gains you saw last year should continue into this year as well? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: I certainly think we create more momentum with new products in general than in the industry cycle. So a new product cycle is very good for us. And I think that in this case, there are two things. One, there is a large-scale adoption of, in this case, our Gen 4. But not just that. We brought out the Gen 5, but also in metrology we had products that were meeting a need. So I'd say that our market share position continues to be very strong. We are investing very heavily in new capability to bring it on. But the other thing we've done in response to the demand in China, we've actually restarted some of our product lines that are well-suited for that market because we believe market share in China is critical going forward. The other thing that's going on there and you may be well familiar is one of the big challenges a lot of our customers have there is talent and engineering talent. So one of the other ways we can help is with the worldwide apps, presence and the ability to support them as they ramp, not only do they benefit but we benefit from strong share as well.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a solid execution. Two questions, Rick. First, on the 10-nanometer and the 7-nanometer, I'm just wondering, how should we think of growth between the wafer inspection and metrology? We have new materials being added and new dimensions with the FinFETs and things like that. So I just wanted to get your perspective on the growth between wafer inspection and metrology. Then I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Sure. Yeah. I think the way I think about it is the wafer inspection is really driving more capability in terms of – if you think about smaller defects and the actual scaling has happened to go into 7-nanometer, so not only do they need more capable tools but they have to run them at higher resolutions, which drives the utilization in a way that they need more capacity. Metrology, there are more layers, especially with multi-patterning. So what you end up with is more capacity device in addition to increased technology. So on a percentage base, both are growing slightly different drivers between the two though.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Okay. Fair enough. I just wanted – the second question as a follow-up is I wanted to understand your momentum on your Gen 5 tool. And how should we think about the ramp in calendar 2017 versus calendar 2016? And is there a possibility of seeding Gen 5 into memory at some point? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah. Gen 5 is pretty much doing what we thought it would do. And like any new product introduction, not necessarily exactly in the places because it's kind of had different adoption in different locations. But we've broadened our penetration. And Gen 5 is now at both memory and at foundry and logic facilities. And we're seeing we've got multiple orders now in both foundry but also what we're seeing in memory. So we feel pretty good about our penetration. We're on the plan that we laid out when we introduced the product in terms of our 2016 objectives. And Bren can talk to the details of that. And then we hope to be entering – through 2017 entering 2018 with a lot of momentum.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Yeah, I think as Rick said, it's going pretty much according to plan. We revenued four tools in 2016, our plan is to revenue 8 to 10 tools in 2017. To Rick's point, they're seeded all over in multiple customers so across all the settlements. The other dynamic is driving Gen 5 besides the discovery opportunities where we compete more directly with (42:33) capabilities is that you're also seeing it deployed in EUV development situations too because it's used as a tool for radical verification when they print wafers and use the wafer results to calibrate pattern fidelity on the wafer or the reticle. So there's an additional use case there that we're encouraged by and we're in line with our plans. And I think by the end of calendar year 2017, we should have somewhere between, I don't know, 15 and 18 tools or so in the field fully installed. So we'll see how many we actually end up with revenue beyond the plan, I told you, but there's – they're out there and getting deployed, demonstrating value.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Summit Redstone Partners LLC: Congrats on a solid execution.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job. Rick, in your prepared remarks, you talked about gaining share and seeing strength in unpatterned wafer inspection last year. What drove that strength in terms of end markets? Was it just the volume of wafers being kind of cranked out in 3D NAND, or which end markets drove that strength? And then I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, unpatterned really does benefit from 3D NAND. So we definitely see demand coming from 3D NAND. And we also see it just in general multi-patterning there are more layers and customers have long realized that monitor wafers can be a very efficient way to clean and maintain and come up from downtime on tools to re-verify their process. So that's really it. Plus we saw, as Bren said, we think the momentum continues based on some of the work we're seeing in the wafer manufacturers which are part of what was driving our March results. So we think that continues to be strong for us.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then on China, the investor community is still kind of skeptical on the Chinese projects, obviously there's 10-plus or these (44:36) and then 5 or 6 more active ones. But overall, when you look at these projects, do you think China has the expertise or the engineering talent to build and run these fabs or are we going to be seeing (44:52) build these fabs and just kind of learn through the experience and then kind of stumble or move towards low-end products (44:58)? I just want to get your sense of how ready China is to build fabs and then run them?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: It's a great question. Let's start with there's certainly a significant commitment, and I've been in this industry a long time and I would say I've heard this before out of China but we're seeing a lot more evidence now of actual commitment. There's also leadership has been put in place from other areas so you have experienced leaders now running a lot of these companies that have demonstrated their ability to run successful organizations in other parts of the world. So I think you have that. The biggest gap probably ends up being the engineering workforce to be able to execute. And I think in that case, what we're seeing is a lot of these ambitious projects are also coming with requests for support from equipment companies. And so we're definitely feeling that and are participating. We are relatively cautious too. And if you take our plans, we don't bake in everything that we hear that's said in China in terms of how we run the business. But we're also positioned to be able to support it, should it ramp. And I think the most significant part of that expansion to WFE is not in 2017 or 2018. It's actually toward the end of 2018-2019. And so I think it's still early. Right now we feel very good about the prospects for 2017, and the early 2018 numbers look very doable from our standpoint.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Very helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You answered this a little bit when you talked about the Gen 5 product and some of the applications that you're getting adoption for that product. But given the continued success of the Gen 4, is that slowing any of the, I guess, the product momentum for Gen 5 and that adoption given that Gen 4 is still, I guess, a workhorse tool for even these next-generation nodes?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Not really. I mean, I think that goes to two things. One is our customers have always sought the lowest cost solution for solving the inspection problems. So if we had not expanded the Gen 4, then maybe that would be the case. But the Gen 5 in its development isn't yet at a point where it could have offloaded those inspections. Whenever we introduce a whole new technology platform, we almost are forced to reduce the functionality of it on introduction, which is the case here. So it has capability but it doesn't have the same breadth of capability that a Gen 4 would have. That will happen over time, and as that does, the Gen 5 will take more and more of the layers as we go forward.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And as a follow-up question, given your strong exposure to the foundry segment, today we're seeing the second-tier foundries building out their 28-nanometer capabilities. How much of, I guess, your expertise in that node given that you've helped the other leading players ramp up on that years ago, how much are you helping out those second-tier players and how is that helping provide potential incremental business or even services opportunities with these second-tier foundries that are trying to get ramped up?
Richard P. Wallace - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Well, we definitely have a close partnership with many players across the board on, say, 28-nanometer, and I do think we support them as best we can. We don't really make money on services from that. What we do is we support them with tool sales. Our market share tends to be pretty good, and we're committed to doing what – helping them with best practices in terms of ramping their facilities. These are very capable people, but they do often appreciate the support. The other thing I'd mention is in some cases we've actually restarted some of the older products to be able to support them with exactly the capabilities that they need. So we're not selling the latest generation, in general, into those facilities. We'll sell a mix. Some new and some of the maybe Gen 3 kind of product line.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great.
Bren D. Higgins - KLA-Tencor Corp.: Market share, just only thing I'll add is market share tends to be stronger with those customers? And so what comes with that is, to Rick's point, the need for some additional support as we work through it. So we have applications engineers in fabs all around the world and they get deployed in these opportunities. And we think we benefit pretty well from the market position we have on the tools and these folks help the customers get value out of the tools.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Mariana, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood. You may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Mariana. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2016. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com. A final cast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release at KLA-Tencor's IR website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In those filings you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks; any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I am pleased to announce the KLA-Tencor's business continues to perform at a very high level. And we delivered another outstanding result in the December quarter, exceeding our guidance for shipments revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the period. In addition, new orders topped $1 billion for the first time in Q2, reflecting KLA-Tencor's market leadership and the critical process control plays and enabling our customers' success at the leading edge, and in legacy notes. For the full year in calendar 2016 KLA-Tencor grew revenue 14% compared to mid-to high-single digit growth for the wafer fabrication industry. Our example rate performance both in the December quarter and for the full year in 2016, as a result of KLA-Tencor's market leadership and coupled with our record backlog of over $1.6 billion sets the stage for another year of strong top line and earnings growth for the Company in calendar 2017. As our record order and backlog numbers demonstrate, KLA-Tencor is experiencing unprecedented levels of demand in our end markets, particularly in foundry and memory. Memory was notable strong in the December quarter driven by both DRAM and 3D NAND investments in Korea where we are experiencing higher adoption of bear wafer inspection along within thin turn and critical dimension measurement solutions, as a result of more firms paying deposited in vertical memory. KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership is fueled by the successful execution of a product strategy that is focused on differentiation and intersecting market needs with the portfolio of complimentary solutions. This ongoing investment innovation and technology leadership help to drive these strong results in 2016, and as a critical component for our long-term growth strategies. For example KLA-Tencor's two latest broadband plasma optical inspection platforms Gen 4 and Gen 5, together address the most challenging defect detection issues for development and capacity monitoring application of current and next generation devices in the marketplace today. We are now on our fourth major product upgrade for the Gen 4 optical inspection platform with multiple tools placed in every advanced production fab in the marketplace And one of the key highlights of the year in 2016 was the successful launch of Gen 5, our new flagship broadband plasma inspection platform. Gen 5 is being deployed by customers to address early yield learning and engineering analysis applications for advanced optical lithography design rules and for EUV development. Calendar 2016 was a record year for the broadband plasma product family, and we see momentum continuing through 2017. In addition to the supplying wafer inspections capability for EUV layers, KLA-Tencor is also playing a critical role in radical inspection for EUV. Our customers are relying on assets interested partner to enable success of the important technology transition to EUV, a move that will allow for lateral scaling and more economical device roadmaps at the leading edge. The new challenges and inherent to EUVs specific process control applications such as mask inspection, radical requalification and scanner control just to name the few present new market opportunities that we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to address. Given our market and leadership in technology, EUV promises to be a positive catalyst for growth that the advanced process control market and for KLA-Tencor. So to summarize KLA-Tencor's December quarter and calendar 2016 results demonstrates are strategies are working and the Company is operating from the position of strength as we've entered into another year of expected strong growth and earnings generation, given the business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, ranking KLA-Tencor's among the top tier of leading semiconductor companies, and with our strong leadership position in each of the most critical process control markets. The stage is set to build on the momentum of calendar 2016 and deliver what we plan to be another exciting year in 2017. We believe KLA-Tencor's is well positioned to successfully execute our strategies and meet or exceed our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7% in 2017 and what is expected to be another year of solid growth for the wafer fab equipment market. Now turning to the guidance for the March quarter, Q3 shipments are expected to be in the range of $850 million to $930 million. Revenue for the quarter expected to be in the range of $860 million to $920 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.42 per share to $1.62 per share. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter represented another outstanding period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Shipments, revenue and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each finished above the range of guidance in the quarter. This result was driven by strong demand across our product portfolio with particular strength in our flagship wafer and mass inspection product lines as well as solid execution and cost management in our manufacturing and service operations. Revenue was 877 million in the December quarter, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.52, and would have been a $1.57 per share at the 21% guided tax rate, GAAP earnings per share was also $1.52. In our press release, you will find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. With the exception of when I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. Now turning to the highlights of the December quarter demand environment, although we're no longer guiding quarterly orders we'll continue to share our perspective on the quarterly -- current quarterly end market demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends and KLA-Tencor's performance. We eventually plan to provide end market mix detail for shipments results and guidance and expect to have that information available once we complete an upgrade of our internal analysis systems sometime in the Company few quarters. At that time our end market customer mix, business segment and regional breakdowns will be provided on the shipment basis. In the interim, we'll continue to provide additional detail on order mix by end market. New orders in the December quarter were approximately $1.1 billion. Memory was 61% in the orders and in line with our forecast for the quarter. Demand was roughly evenly split between DRAM and NAND. We're currently modeling memory orders to be 34% of the total in the March quarter. Foundry was 37% in new system orders in December also as expected, and Foundry is forecasted to grow to 63% of orders in March. We're currently modeling solid growth in Foundry orders in the first half of calendar '17 fueled by 10-nanometer production and 7-nanometer development from multiple foundry customers, and by continued investment in legacy technology nodes. Logic was 2% in new system orders and is currently forecasted to be at a comparable level in the March quarter. In terms of the approximate distribution of orders by product group for the fourth quarter, wafer inspection was 45% to new system orders, patterning was 35%. Patterning includes orders from our radical inspection business. Service was 18%, and non-semi was approximately 2%. New orders in the first half of calendar year 2017 are expected to be roughly flat compared with the second half of calendar '16. Total shipments were 887 million in the quarter and just above the guided range for the quarter of 800 million to 880 million. Looking forward we're modeling March quarter shipments to be approximately flat at the mid-point compared with December and be in the range 850 million to 930 million. Our current build plans are supporting quarterly shipment levels at around 900 million for the next few quarters. Turning now to income statement, as I mentioned in my highlights, revenue was 877 million in December, finishing above the range of guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $860 million to $920 million in the March quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.8% and a new quarterly record for the Company. The better than model gross margin performance in December is largely a function of strong product mix on the incremental revenue delivered in the quarter and operating leverage in our manufacturing and service operations. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63% in the March quarter, down slightly versus the December quarter due principally to the mix of products we plan to revenue in the quarter. Going forward we expect to deliver gross margin results of couple of hundred basis points above our published business model target due to a number of factors including product positioning, new product introduction execution and cost management. We are currently forecasting gross margin in calendar '17 to be approximately 62% plus or minus 50 basis points. Total non-GAAP operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared with September and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%. We are modeling operating expense levels of between $220 million and $225 million in the March quarter and in the range of $900 million and $920 million for the full year in calendar '17. Given our gross margin expectations, we continue to deliver operating margins at the upper end or above our published model for foreseeable future. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.5% in the quarter, above our previously guided long-term planning rate of 21% reflecting the higher mix of revenue from products manufacturing in the U.S. and other discrete items impacting the tax rate. We are planning to this product mix trend to continue through calendar '17, which will put some pressure on the tax rate. We assume a 22% tax rate going forward for modeling purposes. Finally, net income for the December quarter was 238 million and in the end of the quarter was 157 million fully dilutes shares outstanding. I'll turn now the highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investment end of the quarter 2.6 billion, an increase of approximately 100 million compared with the September quarter. Cash from operations was 222 million in the quarter. And free cash flow with 214 million. In December, we paid in aggregate of 85 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units, and made a supplemental payment of 40 million towards our outstanding term loans. To date, the total amount of payments of principally on our term loan has amounted to approximately $254 million since it was added in the December quarter 2014. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor result in December reflect our market leadership the critical nature of process control and our customers gross strategies at the leading edge and in legacy designed rules and our industry leading business model. This coupled with almost 1.1 billion in new orders in the December quarter positioned the Company for strong relative growth versus the wafer fab equipment market in calendar year '17. Current forecast for the wafer fab equipment market to grow mid-single digit in 2017. Against this industry backdrop, we are modeling the Company's revenue to grow slightly better than the broader market. This performance demonstrates the Company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of portfolio solutions addressing the most critical yield requirement to leading edge and our operational core confidences. Given our record backlog and expectations for new orders, KLA-Tencor is well positioned for another year of solid growth in 2017. With that to reiterate our guidance for the March quarter is shipments in the range of 850 million to 930 million, revenue between $860 million and $920 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.42 to $1.62 per share with GAAP EPS of $1.40 to $1.60 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call up for questions, and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today's call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to participate in today's call as time. All right, Mariana, we are ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Rick, I wanted to get a sense of obviously memory orders were really, really strong at quarter. You guys have talked about that being the case. Is that more cyclical? Or is there something secular going on? And I guess I'm particularly asking about 3D NAND because seems like you guys maybe preparing a new solution that's going to help to improve yields there. So, I'm sort of wondering maybe what your outlook generally is for how your exposures are going to grow in memory? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Tim. Yes, we have some success recently with 3D NAND. I think both in terms of existing products, which we're finding more application as our customers. First, the technology is being more broadly deployed by our customer base. And the second is some of the yield challenges they are facing. We think leader in the calendar year will actually have more offerings to support 3D NAND. So, we think, if we execute properly by the end of '17, we should have a larger adoption of inspection to 3D NAND. So, we think that there is upside to our current levels of concentration now.
Timothy Arcuri: And I guess, Bren, question for you. Everybody else likes to put up their financial models and link their revenue to wafer fab equipment. I know it's a little harder for you because it depends on the mix. But if WFE is going to be 37 billion, yesterday, we haven't talked about that. Can you talk a little bit -- can you try to math for us WFE or your revenue relative to WFE? It seems like if you don’t take any share at all, it seems like you could do 3.7 billion pretty easily at 37 billion environment. So, I'm just wondering if you can math revenue your model to WFE? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim it's a good question. I mean as we look at calendar 2017, we think WFE is probably up somewhere in the mid-single digits. When we do our math, we end-up somewhere around 36 billion. And so against that backdrop, as I said in the prepared remarks, we think that we should do better than the broader market, so somewhere in the high single digit growth rate versus calendar 2016. So we feel pretty good about that. I also said in the prepared remarks that over the next few quarters, we expect it will be shipping consistently in an around 900 million. I think as we get further out into the second half of the year through December, I think I've got pretty visibility to my bill plans through September. And as we get to the December, we will see how the second half order book ultimately feels out, but I think we are going to position for a good year and I think depending on how the second half plays out particularly around December. The numbers that you are mentioning aren’t inconceivable to see, if that were to play out that way. But I think as the down, as I said we based on a mid single digit type growth rate, we think will do -- we should do better than the broader industry for the second consecutive year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad: My first question is on EUV. Rick, you've mentioned that you're seeing a good activity for Gen 5 being deployed both for OPC and EUV development. Can you talk about what progress you're seeing there? And how far along do you think you're in the qualification process? And is that something that can materialize in 2018 in meaningful way?
Rick Wallace: EUV, we've had some momentum based on the fact that there's more activity going on in development and in multiple places, multiple sides for our customers, and also the fact that Gen 5 is now out and being deployed especially in the area of qualifying the images that are been printed by EUV lithography. I also mentioned that in mask, we have some success with the 6XX platform that we've serving the EUV mask qualification market, and we think that as the activity continues to pick up on EUV that that part of our business should grow over the next couple of years. With the expectations of high volume manufacturing of EUV by 2019 or 2020, we'll continue to see ramping of those capabilities, and we'll move from characterization to be more part of the production flow as we get out into those out years. And we should see adoption of things like Gen 5 especially in the back end of the line supporting the ramps, middle end and back end of the line supporting ramps as EUV comes into production.
Farhan Ahmad: And then one question on the 3D NAND that you've mentioned for back half of the year, could you give us some sense of how big is the growth opportunity for you in 3D NAND, maybe just in terms of like what portion of the market do you address currently? And what sort of opportunity the new products can bring?
Rick Wallace: Well, Farhan, I think you know we've talked about essentially memory being at about half the adoption rate of foundry in terms of process control adoption; however, it tends to grow faster in many respects for two reasons. One, it looks like there's more capability certainly that we can bring to solve some existing problems that people are not using process control to solve right now, and that I think we can grow that adoption. So, we think that the adoption and or the process control intensity grows in 3D NAND depending on how much ongoing investment there is that sets that market size. But we think it can contribute to our overall outperformance of the industry. 3D NAND recently process control intensity has kind of mapped to what 2D plainer was, as some of the complexity of the process is being understood by our customers. So for us there's not really big difference in process control intensity for plainer versus 3D NAND, as 3D NAND is actually picking up for us as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: On the profitability profile, assuming you guys slightly outgrow the WSE market this year that would imply roughly kind of 3.5 billion in revenues. You guys drove 38% operating margins in December, 38% operating margins imply within your guidance in March. You've given us your sort of views on gross margins for the year and your level of OpEx, which would sort of in play operating margins in that sort of 36% to 37%. Last earnings call, you know of talked me down to a level of 35 percent-ish. But should we expect kind of 36% 37% operating margins on the parameters that you just gave us today? Is that kind of the way where do you think about it?
Bren Higgins: Harlan, it's Bren. Yes, in the prepared remarks I wanted -- as we head into in a year to give a little bit more perspective on how we are sizing the business. We've been doing obviously a lot of work on our strategic planning, so we've have got a deeper view and understanding of the mix of business going forward around certain products. And of course the backlog at the level that give us pretty good visibility to move to the year. So I wanted to go ahead and provide some of that information. I think the numbers that you are coming up with seem to make sense based on the numbers I provided. I think in terms of how we are sizing the business I don’t see how that changes very much going forward, significant swings would cause go up and down but in terms of where we are today versus what we expect I don’t think that will change all that much. Gross margin is always a little bit with the business like ours and the mix of products we have depending on the mix of products can have some influence on gross margin both directions. But the ways you are thinking about it I think make sense and given the funnel and where we are loaded today I feel pretty comfortable with the guidance I provided.
Harlan Sur: You guys had a record year fiscal year '16 from China. It seems like there is more China domestic foundry spending coming online this year. And my question is, is China still a tailwind for KLA this calendar year? And even though these are more legacy type nodes like 20-nanometers, are these guys still tending to buy up to stock and purchasing your latest Gen 4 tools which we obviously know have richer ASPs?
Bren Higgins: They are investing for not only the nodes they are starting on, but they are also trying to invest to be able to migrate those nodes as they go forward and they expect to continue to migrate their designed ropes down. So the interest the other buying, they are not buying Gen 5, but they are buying we are seeing Gen 4 purchases. And also I think for the metrology challenge is that they feel like they are going to face, we're having pretty good penetration there. So, we feel good about China as it goes forward, it feels pretty sustainable based on the conversations we are having with customers and the successfully had to-date there.
Rick Wallace: The second half of '16 was a little bit slow on China so that wasn’t digesting but as we look at calendar '17 from an order perspective I think China indigenous China our native China business will be up pretty significantly from what we experienced in '16. To reach point across a number nodes and very foundry logic centric, don’t expect to see much memory investment in '17 I think that’s more of 18 of them. But we think China is one of these factors why we think that at least for as we look at foundry business into '17 that we have got enough profile from not just the diversity of other customers investing to leading edge but what's happening here.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok of Needham & Co. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: So, first question I have is on your mass inspection product. You talk about how the customer around EUV was seeing handful to 66 products. I am curious is there a way for us to think about that, like let's not about how many chose their shipping this year. Is there anything you think about how much capacity customer will need that to take these EUV tools?
Rick Wallace: Well, historically, there has been a ratio of about EUV. We use to model about 10 scanners for a radical tool. But sometimes I could be frontend loaded when there is, we are doing development work. Part of what's interesting about the scanner is that, lot of scanners during the field the day weren’t really driving much capacity any. Because I don’t think they were really pushing designs very much on the EUV capabilities. We're seeing more advance designs now on EUV, and so I do think that if we go back to that ratio that's not a bad model. Even though, we are not at wavelength with this radical tool, it does seem to be a tracking relatively consistent with that.
Edwin Mok: Okay, actually that's helpful color there. And then another question I have is, one of your peers yesterday talk a lot for the bigger follow-up in the WFE in the second half of this year. And the associate would just be more frontend loaded spending in NAND. I am just curious, are you guys are seeing the same trend in the industry? Do you expect some top trend for your shipment for this year?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I think the second half looks maybe marginally weaker from a shipment perspective in the first half, we're talking about a very low single digit percentage today, and so that could change pretty quickly. So, I don’t see it as a pronounce shift and then when I look through the revenue, I think revenue is sort of half-to-half in terms of how we are modeling today with the WFE assumptions I talked about earlier somewhat flattish. So, I don’t think it's a significant downtick and I have a lot of it also depends on what happens in the second half of the year around some of these other the timing of some of these other investments and I think 7-nanometer development could be wild card for us so it could strengthen into the second half and we just don’t have a lot of visibility into some of that incremental business yet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chin of UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Chin: I actually have a question on image sensor customers. We see some higher present sales than in the past. Just wondering, if you're see anything with customers that can give us some sort of outlook on sales image sensor customers?
Rick Wallace: Image sensors that what's you are asking?
Steven Chin: Yes.
Rick Wallace: We have had good participation from -- in general, I think about the IoT, automotive markets, image sensors kind of in that category of IoT stuff, that's actually have been pretty good for us often what we see there is. If you think Gen 4, it's more or like in the inspection product line and might be Gen 3 products, supporting that. And but it's relatively episodic, so you get somebody that's investing for a particular capacity demand. So, we can't count on it every year, but it's actually have been pretty good business, when it comes along. And I think we work closely with those customers to support them when they're bringing out new technologies. So that's been a steady part of our business over the last couple of years.
Steven Chin: Thank you. And I have one follow-up. Not this only being seen as higher customer demand for 200-mm equipment. Can you talk maybe the mix that 200-mm equipment makes up for your sales? And maybe comment on this type of services revenue that you give 200-mm customer?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I think that one of the surprises, I'd say for the last several years, is the fact that 200-mm two things have happened. One, those fabs are being extended longer, and so what we are seeing as part of the supporting those customers is our service business grows. And we would have expected in a general transition to be down almost zero in terms of percent 200-mm. And I'd say probably its 5% to 10% of our business and systems now can be approaching 200. There're also some older fabs on 300, so you kind of look at it more as the lagging technology. But yes, there's some business on the 200-mm that continues to get developed. They're not very big purchasers of capital, but they're often KLA-Tencor tools there, and it's a part of our business. There is upgrading capability and supporting them as they go forward.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Rick, a big picture question the last time you -- when we went through the industry ramp of 28-nanometers, you saw a large buying spree particularly from the leading edge, but one that also continued for several years. As we begin this transition to 10-nanometers and 7-nanometers, what is your perception of that node and could it be as large as the 28-nanometers which would give you guys, not only a near-term boost, but one that that's a little more sustainable?
Rick Wallance: It's certainly feels that way. I mean when we talk to customers, there're now multiple customers that are playing at 7-nanometers, and really no significant buys for seven right now, I mean there're 10-nanometer buys that are going to be applied to seven later. So, I think we're early days on seven, but it does feel like there'll be a wave of multiple players trying to pursue that node. So, it's very hard for us to size it in general, but our customers seem very enthusiastic, because it's a node that gives both performance and also economic value to our customers, and there're multiple designs been started on seven. So, we feel pretty good about the extendibility of that node and the support for our business as we go forward.
Patrick Ho: And maybe, Bren, for you in terms of OpEx going forward, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about some of the new opportunities and some investments particularly as EUV gets more traction with customers out in the field. How do we look at overall R&D spending as it relates to EUV versus what you presented in your long term model?
Bren Higgins: Well, we're absolutely investing more I mean if you look at the numbers that I provided in the prepared remarks, we do think given the revenue level we have we think the opportunities that are out there, there is an opportunity for us to invest in some of these capabilities, not just in EUV, but Rick talked about 3D NAND earlier and so there's some opportunities there. In terms of EUV, there's some work going on, but as we've said and I'm sure Rick could more to this. But as we said over the last couple of years or so, that any substantial investments to support EUV at least around the radical side of things, that we would be looking for customer participation disputed the business model dynamics there. But in terms of being able to drive higher level of sensitivity through our product portfolio, to be able to address what should be good opportunities for when you're scaling in again in the new EUV environment, we're continuing to invest as we always have to deliver that capability.
Operator: And your next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: Rick, if I look at the size of the GPU, the graphic processor, they're about two to five X bigger than eight to ten like an application processor. Are you guys seeing a demand for your tools increase as there is intrinsically lower use on bigger die sizes to the penetration of high performance computing and the gaming?
Rick Wallace: Great question I think in the early days have some of those designs playing out 10-nanometers. Certainly, the adoption level of process control at 10-nanometers and support of those new GPU is higher as that has been in prior nodes. The question will be what happens when those ramp in terms of does the intensity come back to more historic numbers, and I think that will depend a lot on the customers' actual experience in terms of how they perform and what kind of yield they get. But your point, in terms of course there is more value and more challenge associated with getting the larger die to yield. So, we wouldn’t be surprised if there was -- there was support. Certainly, there are more applications being applied to try to make sure that those designs work, if that is more work going on with the customers. So, we think there is a good opportunity, but it's still relatively early to know how the story plays out in terms of total adoption. In our planning, just say you understand, in our business that Bren has led out, we are not assuming the adoption goes up, we are assuming that would be upside to our plan.
Atif Malik: And then as a follow up you mentioned that you can help to improve the device yields in the 3D NAND. Can you tell us it’s a basic term of what are the issues on 3D NAND leave for customer?
Rick Wallace: Well, I think the most basic way to think about it is. If you think about the way these structures are built then you are going vertical versus always horizontally shrinking, now you are not shrinking as much, but you are going deeper. There is a lot of ways that those materials will break down under the stress of manufacturing, so you'll get defects that would parkway down or all the way down the stack. And for customers, it's very hard to see those. It's very hard to understand how to improve the process. So, part of it what happens is they have to go through destructive, that is electrical test or other means of de-processing the wafers to identify the problem. If we can visualize that for them in the fab which is different kind of inspection challenge it allows them to have fast or correct action to get the yields ramped up. So, it's not so much a size of the defect problem it's depth of defect problem and that’s where we have had modified some of our technology to support that because as long as we have been in the industry it's about finding smaller defects not necessarily these very high aspect ratio defects.
Operator: Your final question comes from Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Bill Grinstead: Good afternoon guys this is Bill Grinstead in for Mehdi. Just quick question on reuse, equipment reuse as one of your customers, customers migrates probably 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer. What kind of impact you guys think that could have? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Well, from 16 to 10, virtually no reuse. I mean that was more dynamic we saw from 20 to 16. So, you had new tools sets, you have more complicated patterning challenges. And since that you have a change in lithography and you have a change in the back in the line too. So those are all new tools. Customers always try to optimize their capital and so to the extent they can always reuse tools or any time they can it would try. So we think going forward from 10 to 7 there could potentially be some with we try to model that into how we think about it and so that's model in the and how we'd outline the financial performance for the next few quarters. But I think if that, I think we feel pretty comfortable that what we experienced at 20 to 16 to 14 will, was a bit unique, and we won't see that going forward. Even from 10 to 7, you've got smaller or you get taller FinFETs, you've got in your new materials in the backend. You've got complicated multi-pattern in techniques, very significant process window challenges. So, we think there is a lot of additive opportunities there and as we introduce new products customers will quickly try to take up that capability and try to improve their costs to. So, I think that the new product cadence helps to insulate from some of that as well, and I think the challenge is going to or they are going to be pretty tough.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Thank you, Mariana. And on behalf of everyone here, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on the call today. An audio reply of today's call will be available on our website shortly following the call, and we look forward to speaking to you all soon. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Christine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2016. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented in non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. In those filings you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks; any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Good afternoon, everyone. Two weeks ago we held a conference call reintroducing the KLA-Tencor story to our stockholders featuring a message that highlighted how our strategies for growth based on market leadership, customer focus, and operational execution provided the foundation for the outstanding results we achievement in fiscal year 2016 and set the stage for an exciting future for the company as we move forward. Today I'm very pleased to announce that we got off to a very solid start in FY17 as KLA-Tencor finished above the midpoint of guidance for shipments and revenue for the first quarter and exceeded the range for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. September quarter orders came in slightly better than our internal forecast highlighted by strong foundry mentioned [ph]. These results were fueled by strong customer acceptance of new products and a business model that consistently delivers superior operating leverage, providing the resources to rank KLA-Tencor among the Top Tier of all technology company in terms of returning cash to shareholders. Our recently announced 4% increase in the quarterly dividend level from $0.52 to $0.54 per share is further evidence of our confidence in the strength of our business and our ongoing commitment to enhance stakeholder value. Our performance in Q1 also affirm KLA-Tencor's ongoing focus on providing value to our customers in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. As in the past, a key contributor to the strong demand we're experiencing today is the success of new products across our product portfolio. Our market leadership is sustained by ongoing successful execution of a product strategy that's focused on intersecting market needs with a portfolio of complimentary solutions to address the broad range of yield challenges our customers are facing at the leading edge. And the pace of new production introduction continued at a rapid clip. Over the last 12 months we have launched two new products in broadband plasma wafer inspection, as well as new products and laser scanning wafer inspection, being review unpattern wafer inspection and mass inspection. In our flagship broadband plasma optical inspection portfolio, the new Gen 5 platform is currently addressing early yield learning challenges and engineering analysis applications, critical to both, EUV and advanced optical lithography design role development. We have also recently introduced upgraded capability for our Gen 4 product line to meet the high volume in-line monitoring needs of customers who are ramping 10 nanometer capacity. The expanded Gen 4 platform is currently experiencing very strong customer acceptance in the marketplace and is exceeding our own expectations, both in terms of market reception and operational execution. We're also very encouraged by the strength we're seeing today in mass inspection. Our leading edge mass inspection portfolio is not only being incorporated into our customers optical mass inspection technique but is also the preferred technology to support early adoption of EUV as customers work to qualify mask for this very important technology inflexion. So to summarize our Q1 results demonstrate our strategies are working and the company is operating from a position of strength. As we look ahead to the December quarter and beyond, the stage is set to build on the success and deliver what we expect to be an exciting year for the company in 2017. Given our leading market position, our focus on customer collaborations and with our continued operating discipline, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to successful execute our strategies and achieve growth in calendar 2017 consistent with our long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7%. This is against the backdrop of WFE growth forecast to be in the low to mid-single digits for the year. Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter; Q2 shipments are expected to be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Revenue for the quarter expected to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the mid-point of our guidance to a range of $805 million to $865 million, with non-GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.28 per share to $1.48 per share. I will now turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick and good afternoon. The September quarter represented another solid period of financial performance and operational execution for KLA-Tencor. Revenue was near the top end of the range and earnings per share finished the quarter above the range driven by strengthening gross margins that continue to reflect strong differentiation of our products in the marketplace. Revenue for Q1 was $751 million and fully diluted non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.16. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.13 in the quarter. In our press release, you will find GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of $0.03 difference. With the exception of when I exclusively refer the GAAP results, my commentary will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. In regards to highlights of the Q1 demand environment, we are no longer reporting quarterly booking results or quantifying order guidance in terms of dollar amounts but we will continue to share our perspective on the current quarterly demand picture to give investors insight into industry trends. End market mix estimates for the December quarter based on current forecast. Foundry was 69% of new semiconductor system orders in September; foundry bookings featured strong demands across our product portfolio to support leading edge development projects although foundry expected decline to 30% of total system orders in Q2 due to project timing. We are currently expecting foundry orders to grow in the first half of calendar '17 compared with the second half of this calendar year. Memory was 15% of new system orders in Q1 with demand evenly split between DRAM and NAND. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% of the total in December largely due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project build out in Korea. Logic was 16% of new system orders in the September quarter and is expected to be approximately 10% of the Q2 order mix. In terms of distribution of orders by product group for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2017, wafer inspection was approximately 37% of new system orders, patterning was approximately 33% of orders; the patterning order profile includes mass inspection system bookings, service was 28% and non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q1 were $786 million and then the upper half for the guided range of $735 million to $815 million. Looking forward, we are modelling December quarter shipments to grow sequentially 7% at the mid-point and be in the range of $800 million to $880 million. Turning now to the income statement; revenue was $751 million finishing at the top end of the range of guidance for the quarter. We expect revenue to grow approximately 11% sequentially at the midpoint to a range of $805 million to $865 million in the December quarter, and our current forecast shows revenue levels in the first half of calendar '17 growing in the mid to high single digits compared with the second half of calendar '16 consistent with our long-term annual growth target of 5% to 7% and driven by our strong backlog and expected order profile for the next few quarters. Gross margin was 63.1% in Q1 in nearly flack compared with the record goes to margin results we posted in the June quarter in spite the sequential quarterly decline in revenue, the strong gross margin performance in Q1 reflects the benefit of a more favorable product mix than was originally modeled for the quarter. Lower part expenses in our service business and lower inventory reserve expenses associated with new product transitions, we expect gross margins to be in a range of 62% to 63% in the December quarter, down slightly versus the September quarter principally due to a less favorable of product mix in the revenue plan, offset by an increase in revenue.  Total operating expenses were $220 million, down $6 million compared with the June quarter and operating margin with 33.8% a quarter. We expect quarterly operating expense levels to remain at the $220 million dollar level, plus or minus a few million the next several quarters and to continue to deliver strong operating leverage and what we expect to be a growth year for the company in 2017. Our effected tax rate was 20% in the quarter, just below our long-term planning rate of 21%. The lower tax rate in the quarter largely reflects the benefit of early adoption of a new accounting standard for stock based compensation. You should continue to use 21% for modeling purposes.  Finally, net income for the September quarter with $182 million and we ended the quarter with $157 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turnout of the highlights from the balance sheet in our cash for statement. Cash and investment end of the quarter $2.5 billion, roughly flat with the June quarter. Cash from operations was $170 million in a quarter. And free cash flow with $160 million. In September, we paid in aggregate of $89 million and regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units, and made a supplemental payment of $40 million towards our outstanding term loans.  To date, the total amount of payments of principally on our term loan has amounted to approximately $214 million since have added in the December quarter 2014. In conclusion, KLA-Tencor result in September signals a strong start for the company in FY 17 in coupled with expectations for the December quarter, position a company for strong relative growth versus the way for fab equipment marketing counter 16. This performance demonstrate the company's market leadership, the strong customer acceptance of a portfolio solution addressing the most critical yield requirement of the leading edge, and our operational core competencies.  Given our strong backlog in the expected growth trajectory new orders, including a book to bill forecast of greater than one in the December quarter, and the first half of 2017 order profile that is stronger than the second half of 2016 KLA-Tencor into position for year of solid growth in 2017. With that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is shipments in the range of 800 million to 880 million. Revenue between $805 million and $865 million. And non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.28 to $1.48 per share with GAAP EPS of $1.26 to $1.46 per share. This concludes our remarks in the quarter I will now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you Bren. At this point we would like to open up the call to Q&A, and we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to reach your follow up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call, as time permits. Christine, we are ready for our first question. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you so much, I had two -- nice job guys; I guess the first question is really wreck on 7 nanometer. You know the last really economical new in foundry we had was 28 nanometer but recently a host of companies, most recently TSMC are now talking about 7 nanometer being very big, maybe even as big as 28 was. So am curious on getting your perspective on way for demand at that note and how much of this maybe has been bought already in the orders you've got for 10 in the third calendar quarter and how much that is still on the comp? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Thank Tim, I was in Asia last week revisiting and getting reacquainted with our customer base and there is a lot of excitement I think about the potential for 7 nanometer to your point. Most of the investment that we've seen so far, in terms of production investment has been for 10 nanometer, we have seen investment for the development in 7 and even some looking forward to 5 so I think most of what happened was today that we've seen is 10 and we do expect to see continued strength as we go forward in for 7 nanometer. Bren, anything to add to that?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think Tim, you know we've had foundries very strong and we even know a drop off this quarter, we think we see a bounce back into the first half of calendar 2017. There's always a dynamic about how the capacity openly get sell by the people following the leaders and so customers will try to optimize their capacity, as much as they can, so to the extent they try to use some of that equipment they may try, but and then given the challenges in a node and what we're hearing about size of it, we feel pretty confident about that foundry trajectory into the calendar year. 
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. And just a second thing, I-- wanted to talk a little about memory because it looks like there's some uptake in the-- adoption of inspection in memory here in the next round of orders, you have cited a some big orders coming out of Korea during the fourth quarter. Can you talk about what's going in memory? Is there an uptake in inspection in intensity, in memory and particularly why it is happening and can it sustain going forward, thanks. 
Rick Wallace: Yes, it is not just inspection I think process control in general, we are-- seeing some strength and I think it kind of goes across the portfolio. I would attribute the increase in inspection to memory which we have seen some, is more a function of Gen 5 where we've had some placements there that maybe in the past might of been served by alternate technologies like EVM, so we've seen some strength, I'll be modest at this point. The metrology is also growing and a lot of that has to do with some of the challenges in terms of things like registration, and so the overlay business and some of the film's businesses. So we're feeling pretty good about it, it's not at the intensity levels of course of foundry, but it is significantly up from where it had been in prior nodes and then we see strength to going forward there. 
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you guys, appreciate it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I had question on Gen 5 just in terms of how -- where you're seeing that option of Gen 5 verses Gen 4, and how we should think about the ramp of Gen 5 next year, and also even at the Analyst Day at Semicon [ph], you had first talked about Gen 5, you talked about potential to gain some of the layers from EVM applications and is that something that you already starting to see? 
Rick Wallace: Farhan, thanks for the question, yes we do pretty good about Gen 5 I think that what we were hoping for is to get it out mainly as a discovery tool. So way back in Semicon [ph] and 2015 we talked about the discovery market and our goal overtime was to get to 50% of that market served by optical. I think by the run rate we have now the end of calendar 2016 we're dressing about a third of that markets, so I think we've got about a third of that market, and our target remains that by the end of 2017 to be 50% of that market. Part of the market grew a little bit, because EVM was just not capable of satisfying some of it, so there is a gap in terms of functionality in terms of whole wafer but the displacement I think is going on we're seeing Gen 5 adopted more broadly. Gen 5 really does not go into production and replaced Gen4 until future notes when the critical defects size gets smaller, and you can really think about that more in terms of the adoption of EUV lithography. So, for now it's doing what we hoped it would do, customers like what they see it's a new products so of course there's improvements that we need to keep making, but we think we're on track for the plan that we laid out little over a year and three months ago. 
Bren Higgins: What I really want to add to that; is that we're pretty much in line with what we thought would be we have 4 or 5 units revenue in this calendar year, and then that number would probably double or so will take 8 to 10 units into calendar 2017. So to Rick's point given our objectives in the in the 2017 we think that is how the adoption plays out. most of what we're seeing in terms of 10 nanometer production is really being driven by the Gen 4 product line, receptions just been really strong for that in its capability, so we're really encouraged by that, the extend ability we think and have this move into seven and the two will be mixed and matched and impaired to meet discovery high end production, and then ultimately high volume production type use cases. 
Farhan Ahmad: Got it. And my second question on the foundries of -- There's been a big growth in foundry investments in China this year, I wanted to understand like from your perspective how much of the foundry demand this year that is coming out of China -- China foundries. And as you think about the 28 nanometer down put those foundries, how do you think that will play bigger advantage as you typically have like a very strong of process control intensity a 28 nanometer some of the first wave of foundry investment that we saw.
Rick Wallace: So on the foundry business overall, I mean we had a record year in China in FY16, so the year that ended in June in bookings so that those tools of these new revenue in through the course of this year. So I would say of our total foundry business in the year maybe 30%, 35% or so of the total is probably foundry.
Bren Higgins: Yes, and then in terms I was there last week and meeting with customers and I think that 28 nanometer demand, this is that there's a lot of investment going on as you know, there's a lot of new employees. I think they are counting on us to help educate, train, and support them as they wrap these new fabs and they got very aggressive ramp. So I think we look forward to good business and be able support our customers as they go through there, and I think that we see the intensity being somewhere, in fact in some ways because in many cases you're starting greenfield for some these facilities, the intensity ends up being front and loaded for some of them, so it's even higher as well as we go forward. So we're looking forward to great things that in our China operations. 
Rick Wallace: Yes to clarify I meant 30% to 35% of the foundry business with China. 
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you, that's all.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Harlan Sur [ph] from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and the great margin profiles. given the view of WFP [ph] growth next year and obviously your business going in line or better than that, we should see the team you know roughly around $3.3 billion in revenues in calendar 2017 combination of industry growth, momentum and Jen 4, Gen 5 in your other new products. If you continue to drive the better performance in the margin funds, feels like operating margins in that kind of 36% to 38% range would seem achievable, I'm not asking you guys to endorse the $3.3 billion revenue number, but if you were to beat those levels, does 36% to 30% operating margin sound reasonable.
Bren Higgins: Harlan, its Bren. So I mean just following the map to the point that we think that we're going to grow sort of in line with the market in the next year, and the market forecast that that we laid out, you end up with that revenue level I think that's fair. I think we're seeing some tail winds in gross margin right now that we've seen or -- for several quarters but I think as we start to transition into some of the newer products, some of the benefits we've seen around warranty and support costs, and an efficient cycle times and things like that. I think some of that goes away now. I do think and as I said in the in the call a couple weeks ago, I do believe that versus the model we published that were operating probably a solid 100 basis points above what we had put out there. so and I think that sustainable, so I think some of what we're seeing today be hard for me to come to replicate that type of gross margin profound in next year, so might be a little bit a degradation there, so given at that revenue level the range that you mention probably feels a little bit hot, but I would say you're probably in that 35% range plus or minus 100 basis points or so. Now there is a lot of factors in that mix and so on but that's how I would characterize it.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the insights there and we've tended to focus on the Gen 5 and the 29-30 and 29-35 upgrade cycles, in some of our most recent reports but obviously you guys are driving new product cycles across their wafer inspection, review document inspection and of course your new radical inspection platform. I'm sure you guys track this but can you give us a view of the mix of your new platform as the percent of your current bookings and maybe some comparison of that some of your prior cycles?
Bren Higgins: The comparison will be tough, I mean I don't really have that data; I mean what we are booking a lot of these new platforms that things to come out in this last year, right. so in even in the more trailing edge businesses like in China, they are buying and the latest Gen of tools, with the ability to try to use that capability as they ramp through this early development of new technology there. So I would say the majority -- pretty solid amount of the business is new products but I don't have the actual percentage.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Steven Chin from UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Chin: Hey guy's thanks for taking my question. Related to the foundry opportunity in China there is an announcement of a ramp of 8-inch and 12-inch capacity earlier this week. I just want to get a sense of -- and sort of price desk on -- looking back last few years I see that the customers sort of mix between four big customers and you may be give us a sense of China foundry customers getting into that category?
Rick Wallace: I guess I'm not sure exactly the question sorry, Stephen, but what…
Steven Chin: I'm just trying to -- like I guess simply how big do you think the China foundry opportunity could be?
Rick Wallace: I see. Well, Bren talked about the percent of our business that we had -- if we look back just to give you an idea of FY16 that finished, China was the second biggest market for us and that was partly because there was some underspending going on but China is pretty significant for KT and I think as we go forward we have the combination of this investment even though it's in -- maybe N minus two technology [ph], we also have a very significant amount of penetration and market share and also this is higher adoption because its foundry. So they are buying some of our newer tools and we see a lot of interest in ramping these facilities quickly, they are spending a lot of money, they are trying to grab markets share, in some cases service the domestic demand; so we feel pretty good about our position there and the fact that there is an area that we're going to invest more heavily going forward as overall to support that China investment cycle. This one is real.
Bren Higgins: But the only thing that I would add is while I think that there are certainly some new development activities happening there as they are ramping these fabs from greenfield state, that ultimately -- its serving a global market and so I think you'll see some movement around in terms of who gets market share but there will be inflexion in the short-term, probably some of it doesn't necessarily contribute to supply but overtime it eventually will. So I think the overall foundry dynamics in the long run will stay pretty consistent but there is certainly a commitment there and there is a focus to Rick's point, not only on the ramping of new technology but also our market position there is very strong.
Steven Chin: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: Great, thanks for taking my question. So I guess first question on the patterning part of your business; I think on the last call you guys talk about increased focus there on patterning -- just call one to see you've implied more commentary around that; is there more focus on metrology and also in terms of financial impact should we expect more R&D spending on that side which ultimately will increase your OpEx?
Rick Wallace: I'll take the first part and then let Bren talk about the second part. We're definitely seeing demand associated with multi-patterning and also EUV. And I'd say the EUV work is in the radical space where we do have tools that are dedicated now to EUV in terms of our 6XX and some of our newest 6XX capability; people are buying for EUV so that's early days of course for that. In terms of overall challenge with customers whether deregistration overly, film thickness or optical CD; all those things are potential areas for drug. We're doing well, we think there is more upside to them and we feel good about our competitive position. Now whether or not we see significant increases in the next 12 months but I think overtime there is potential to keep that business growing. And from an investment standpoint Bren could you talk a little bit about how we thought about that?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I mean we've got a pretty active portfolio management process here in the company and I think given the strategic reorganization that we did a year ago we have the ability to move capital around much more freely than we did in the past so we will continue to execute our process, we've been investing in those businesses, we'll continue to do so. I gave some guidance in the prepared remarks around what I expect OpEx levels to be overall; there is a bit of an increase there and we are trying to drive the focus of that to be mostly R&D with an overall target of trying to 60% or the R&D expenses or the overall OpEx as R&D.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great, that's helpful. And then, I guess just circle back to China or maybe just increase level or investment we see on a trading act [ph]; I think you talked a lot about selling new product and even these customer buying new products but to the extent that they buy older generation products because that's what they need for 28 or higher note. Do you -- should we expect some pricing pressure on that and just because there are more legacy tools?
Rick Wallace: I don't think that's really what we're seeing. I mean right now we do have some ability to flex the different tool capability people need but a lot of these facilities don't think they are going to stay at 28, so there is a desire to have newer capability and of course it doesn't hurt them to have it when they are doing their 28 work but they are hoping that they are going to go obviously lower than that. So I think we're in pretty good shape regardless of where they buy in the portfolio. It's not quite the same; I'll give you a very different example, if you think of some of the investment going on in Internet of Things where people -- maybe an automotive or they are in sensor technology, then we're talking about older tool sets and maybe even some of our KT pro-stuff which is reconfigured or refurbished tools, that's not what we're seeing in our markets in China for the most part, maybe there will be an element of that later but that not what it looks like right now.
Edwin Mok: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.
Jagadish Iyer: Thanks for taking my question, Rick. Two questions; first, what's the termination of the deal with LAN? How much of your effort is focused on putting on the EUV mass inspection, and can you give us some clarity in terms of the line of sight of revenues from this product line as ASML [ph] prepares to ship a dozen tools next year? And then I have a follow-up.
Rick Wallace: So the way we're serving the EUV market is with the 6XXX series that's been out for several years and we have some additional capability to do that. So that's already part of the portfolio and had nothing to do with any discussions we had with our other companies, that's out there and no we're seeing their demand -- some demand for that. I can't really say that at what point that's going to ramp because for a long time it was a part-time application for some customers but we are seeing some dedicated purchase of those tools for that capability and it really will depend on how many starts they have in terms of different types of devices, how many mask they have. But whatever they have with the adequately time we are prepared to serve it; we don't -- it's not really about additional development beyond the capability that we have and some software upgrades and algo upgrades in that platform, we're not talking about a new platform which we talked about several years ago, that's not what we are doing; we're not doing an actinic [ph] inspector, we're developing additional capability on our existing products to serve it.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay, fair enough.
Bren Higgins: Then the only other thing on that is that we would add is that they will do flap-down inspection to qualify radicals, certainly for recall capabilities and incoming quality checks where they will basically print the waiver and do Gen 5 inspections on the waiver to qualify radicals as another checkpoint in terms of making sure radicals are good.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay, fair enough. Then on a big picture question, I just wanted to understand given that there are so many smaller players in the process control segment; what are your thoughts on consolidation post-termination of the deal with Lam?
Rick Wallace: It's not really an area we're focused on, I mean its possible others might do that but we feel pretty good about the products that we have, the range that we have and our ability to satisfy the markets with our organic efforts in terms of process control. So it's not really something we're looking at.
Jagadish Iyer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Rick, first in terms of some of your comments about memory and inspection, given the transitions that are going on, particularly in the 3D NAND front, the capital intensity from metrology [ph] has obviously increased and it makes sense for your overlay data film and even OCD metrology business. What's been some of the key drivers that have gotten at least some Gen 5 evaluations in that marketplace where traditionally they haven't used as much inspection?
Rick Wallace: I think just the fact that there -- as customers are looking at the newer technology notes. First of all, there are more customers trying to get into production; second of all, as those that are in-production are looking to new capability; just the ability to have a better sense of debugging the process in terms of -- from the discovery phase, not really from in-production, so it's really that. And in terms of their ability to see things they've never seen before because if they had EVM Solution, they could find small defects but they couldn't get away for signature, and now they can do both, they can find small defects and get way for level signature.
Patrick Ho: Great. And Bren on the supply chain side of things, you guys have performed really well over the last year in terms of seeing the increases and booking and shipments and trying to surround very quickly; can you just give a little bit of color what some of the tactics and I guess efforts you've made that have had the quick turnaround you've had on the -- in terms of the shipment from bookings?
Bren Higgins: Yes, the NPI process at KLA which is new product introduction where engineering is headed off to manufacturing; on a lot of the new platform transitions that we've had has been really exceptional so tools are being handed over to operations, we have good design stability, our marketing and sales teams are managing the transitions well with customers; so we are not getting stuck necessarily with a lot of the extra inventories, we move customers from one platform to the next. Because of the design stability you don't have retrofit programs and other things; we are out there trying to fix tools as you're shipping them out. So it's been a huge factor I think -- not only in the conversation but also been a factor in the margin profile; A) because of the inventory issues but also the fact that the service cost around the warranty cost to support the tools and get them installed quickly has been fairly efficient, and so that's been a factor as well. So very impressed with the teams been able to do this and do this in a period of time where there was a lot of work around integration planning distraction and so on, so really impressed at work.
Rick Wallace: I think the one other thing is, as we've taken more risk in terms of inventory risk so one of things we've done is provided more flexibility in the master schedule to be able to react to market demands, especially most of our customers now have a very short visibility into their cycle so we're trying to be prepared so that we don't get caught out not having capacity when it's needed.
Patrick Ho: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thanks for taking my question, good job on the quarter. Rick, can you talk about the yields that you guys are seeing on 3D NAND over the last New Year or so? Is that going to be on 3D NAND and the bunch of folders; I'm just curious where you think the yields are broadly speaking on 3D NAND? Will you cover [ph] on 3D NAND different from other devices and logic and [indiscernible]?
Rick Wallace: Yes, obviously given the relative small number of players, I'm going to be careful about this. I would say that the leaders feel good about where they are and I won't comment to that. There are other players getting in the market and I would say that we are seeing success but it is -- if you think about a yield curve, I think that there is a long flat part of that curve down around zero, and I think it took a while for people to debug the process. And frankly, one of the things -- one of the areas for opportunity for us going forward is there is not a really good defect discovery mode for 3D NAND because there is really no tool capable of helping debug; and even although we've made some attempts, when you do find the defects, they are very hard to verify because you have to essentially reprocess or flip them to go find it. So I'd say it's been slow in terms of getting started; now it's getting better. I think that there is -- some people are getting their process but as they look at expanding to the next technical challenges we anticipate yield is going to be a big part of the challenge and I think there is a lot of interest in partnering with us to come up with solutions to address that because obviously there is demand there but they are certainly getting very challenged by making the processes actually work.
Atif Malik: Okay. And then on the foundry side, we've heard from Lam Research yesterday that they did expectation for next year foundry investments are going to clap to down and then they talked about maybe little bit of digestion [ph] and tend not to be driven. And you're expecting to actually get drove in the first half of '17, is your optimism based on the success of your new products or are you assuming the investments at foundries will kind of sustain at the level we are putting this year?
Bren Higgins: I think -- so Atif, this is Bren. I don't think our general view on the year is much different. I think there could be some growth in foundries as we build it bottoms up but we think it will see continued momentum around and my comments were order, so you'll start to see those tools ship in the second half of the year that will also will see stronger foundry shipments in revenue in the second half related to 7 nanometer activity. But I don't know what -- how they make up their forecast but at the end of the day, I -- as I said, I feel like we're not that far apart and generally in terms of how we look at it and how we look at the year overall.
Atif Malik: So Bren, just to be clear do you expect orders in first half of calendar '17 to be higher than the second half of '16?
Bren Higgins: Yes, I do, both for overall and within foundry.
Atif Malik: Got it, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Craig Alice [ph] from B.Riley. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking the question. I'll start with one that's pretty high level; it's very nice to hear the confident tone on what can happen in the first half of calendar '17. So the question is, relative to a year ago or little bit more when you were last providing quarterly updates, has the visibility on the business improved? And if it has, to what extent is that improvement due to industry dynamics versus company specific, potentially product cycle dynamics that apply for KLA?
Bren Higgins: I don't think it's really changed all that much, I mean to Rick's point earlier, I think we've tried to be as flexible as we can; we've taken some risks, I think we're managing through transitions and any time we have product transitions to bring a new product with new capabilities of the market, there is a level of customer demand that goes with that. So I guess in one way on anytime you have a transition, you do see some increase in visibility but we are still reacting to -- our customers are facing short lead times with their customers and trying to expect us to follow suit with that and we're doing all we can to try to be as flexible as we can to meet their needs. One other thing now that is, there is a little different is, the strength out of China is pretty different and there are Greenfield's that are happening, there is big investment plan. So if you think about that part of our business, there is a much more committed and maybe that could change but they are more committed than it was hard to see in the past.
Unidentified Analyst: That makes sense. The follow-up is a question on products in next year's outlook, so in the year where the business has potential to grow 5% to 7% in line with the target model, the product like Gen 5 can double next year as I think I heard previously -- what would some of the other products be that would be viewing some of that company specific growth in a year with a rising top line?
Bren Higgins: Well, you know our 5% to 7% are through cycle multi-year target, right and that was -- when we put that together and say, look from calendar '15 and as we're sizing around the business, we're going to position it so we can deliver that level of revenue growth and try to have operating leverage that's 2X the growth rate. I mean certainly Gen 5 is a bigger piece but there will be some mix and matching that will happen within broadband plasma. So I think it's really -- the strength is, I don't see a fundamental shift in overall mix as we move into next year. To Rick point earlier, there could be more investment in radical inspection as customers begin to prepare for more development activities around EUV. So that could be an inflecting product a little bit into the year; year to year, but overall I think the mix looks relatively consistent across the different product segments.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: We have time for one more question. Your last question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. My first question is, have you looked at your annualized revenue for your December quarter, you get to somewhere around $3.3 billion. Sorry, if the question has been asked before but if you look at the operating model that you guys put out, you guys should be somewhere around 59% in gross margin. I'm curious if you think this is kind of permanent step up in gross margin forecast while they are some of the factors that's driving the upside in your near-term?
Bren Higgins: Yes Sidney, we got that question earlier but just to go over it again really quickly, yes, there is -- we've clearly been outperforming the model, I think some of that is due to some of the maturity of the platforms that are out there, we're transitioning some new platforms and so I think will lose some of those tailwinds we've had but to the point I made earlier, I think we're operating probably a 100 basis points or more over that model and so as you play that through, I think you will see the same kind of performance in the operating margin line.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great. Sorry for asking the same question. My follow-up question is, let's go back to Gen 5 product, it sounds like you guys don't expect Gen 5 to be cannibalizing Gen 4 until EUV is in production, so that would be put you in 2018 to 2020 timeframe. But if you go back to when Gen 4 was in R&D mode per say, is that roughly the same kind of timeframe? The same number of tools that you used for R&D before they go to -- they go into production?
Rick Wallace: Yes, here is the big difference is. There is no real scaling going on right now. I mean and tell you here EUV, essentially with the multi-patterning, you're not really doing anything relative to defect size, so Gen 4 from a lot of customer's perspective serves that market. So it's really -- people want more sensitivity but it's more about discovery. Frankly, if add the deal with those same defects on the earlier nodes on the current nodes, they wouldn't be able to be in large-scale production. So it really has hinged on when you see advanced technologies going into production on EUV.
Sidney Ho: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I'd turn the call back over to you.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you Christine, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We remind you an audio reply of today's call will be available on our website later on this afternoon. We appreciate your interest in KLA. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Connor and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to KLA-Tencor's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations: Thank you, Connor. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2015. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 P.M. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement our earnings call including a reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements including those that we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of the quarter and our view of the demand environment in the second half of calendar year 2015, and provide guidance for the September quarter. Then Bren will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials. KLA-Tencor executed well in Q4, delivering bookings and revenue just above the midpoint of guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share at the upper end of the guided range, reflecting our market leadership, strong gross margin performance, and focused cost discipline. New orders for June were in line with our expectations at $672 million, driven by stronger than expected demand from memory customers focused on 3D NAND capacity expansion which was offset by weaker logic and foundry orders in the quarter. Looking ahead to the overall industry demand environment for the second half of calendar 2015, memory investments focused primarily on 3D NAND capacity additions and is expected to increase and broaden out among the market leaders in the second half of the year. Capacity investment in DRAM is expected to moderate in the second half of the year, with customers focused on technology conversions and process migration. In foundry and logic, investment in the second half of the year is expected to be focused on FinFET capacity additions by the market leaders as well as incremental new capacity expansion for 28-nanometer foundry. However, uncertainty over the timing and magnitude of leading-edge capacity ramps for two major foundries continues to create headwinds for foundry CapEx and the remainder of calendar year 2015. With the recently announced reduction in logic CapEx budget for 2015, leading-edge logic investment is seen to remain at low level for the rest of the year. Our current expectation is for KLA-Tencor to begin shipping process control equipment for 10-nanometer development in the first half of calendar year 2016. For KLA-Tencor, our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. The focus of our strategy is on a long-term revenue growth objective of 5% to 7% per year, driven by leading technologies and differentiated solutions, and fueled by a high level of R&D investment in one of the industry's leading business models. At SEMICON West this year, we discussed some of the structural changes we have implemented in our global organization to streamline our go-to-market strategies, and focus product development efforts on the best opportunities in pursuit of these strategies. We expect these actions to begin to produce results over the next few quarters. And we plan to receive initial orders for our latest generation flagship optical inspection platform and see the benefit of our recent OpEx reductions reflected in our earnings in the second half of fiscal year 2016. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $450 million to $650 million. Guidance for revenue in the September quarter is in the range of $595 million to $655 million and non-GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.66 in the quarter. With our current backlog and the anticipated order profile for the second half of the year, we expect bookings shipment and revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his review of the numbers.
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q4, my perspective on current trends in the marketplace, and our outlook for the second half of calendar year 2015. Revenue for Q4 was $756 million above the midpoint of guidance and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter at the top end of the guided range in $0.99 per share. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the difference in EPS of $0.10. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in today's press release. Turning now to customer segment commentary for the June quarter. New orders in Q4 were $672 million, also above the midpoint of the guided bookings range for the quarter of $550 million to $750 million as we saw strength in NAND flash orders in the period. Memory was 62% of new system orders in June, up strongly on a sequential basis both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared with the March quarter. Memory demand in the June quarter featured strong NAND flash demand with orders from multiple customers supporting 3D NAND expansion projects highlighting the results. Foundry demand was 33% of new orders for Q4 and moderately below our expectations for the quarter. Logic was 5% of new orders in June, down sequentially and down compared with our original forecast. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group. This breakdown by product group now reflects the new organization structure we introduced two weeks ago at SEMICON West. For the purpose of comparison, the wafer inspection group is largely comparable to the order breakdown previously categorized under the same name and the patterning group now includes both the former metrology and reticle inspection categories. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, wafer inspection was approximately 47%, patterning was approximately 24%, service was 27%, and non-semi was 2%. Total shipments in Q4 were $739 million and below the guided range, principally due to a delay in buyout timing of a high ASP leading-edge mask inspection system, changing customer requirements for sub-20-nanometer shipments to a foundry customer that occurred late in Q4, and an accident in a customer fab that led to shipment delays into the September quarter. Although current shipment backlog is strong at $984 million, the scheduled backlog is concentrated among a few customers who have recently been adjusting their scheduled delivery dates, impacting our visibility on a quarter-to-quarter basis and leading to shipment delays of tools originally expected to ship in the June and September quarters to later in our fiscal year. In total, we ended Q4 with over $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $984 million of shipment backlog, orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the six months to nine months, and $221 million of revenue backlog for products that have shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. Looking forward, we are modeling September quarter shipments in the range of $610 million to $690 million. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $756 million, up 2% sequentially compared with the March quarter and above the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $595 million to $655 million in the September quarter, driven by the lower shipments forecast resulting from certain customer shipment delays and timing of customer product acceptances required for certain tools in the quarter. Gross margin was 58.5%, a 150 basis point improvement compared with the March quarter, benefiting from a more favorable product mix and service mix than originally modeled. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in September, largely a function of the lower expected revenue levels for the quarter but in the range of our targeted 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. Total operating expenses were $214 million, down $4 million compared with the March quarter and down approximately $17 million on a year-over-year basis compared with the June 2014 level. Operating margin in the June quarter was 30.2%. The lower operating expense levels in Q4 reflected some of the benefit of the actions we have taken to adjust our global operations to match a consolidated customer environment, and to focus our R&D investments on our best opportunities, while maintaining our incremental operating margin model of 50% to 60%. As Rick mentioned, our long-term objective is to grow revenue in the range of 5% to 7% per year through cycle over the long-term with a focus on market leadership, strengthening our position in our core markets, and continuing to drive opportunities for growth in our service business. Accompanying that goal is the objective to grow operating income at twice the rate of revenue growth over time. Results of the June quarter demonstrate good cost discipline and strong execution towards our long-term profitability growth objective. Accordingly, we are currently forecasting a $2 million sequential decline in quarterly operating expense to the $212 million level in the September quarter. This would represent a $28 million reduction in operating expenses compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 at similar revenue levels. Our effective tax rate was 21% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate of 22%. In fiscal year 2016, you should continue to use 22% as a long-term planning rate for KLA-Tencor. The planning rate does not include any benefit from the R&D tax credit in the United States. In the event that this tax credit is extended, we'll modify our planning rate assumption. Finally, net income for the June quarter was $159 million or $0.99 per fully diluted share and we ended the quarter just under 160 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I'll turn now to the highlights from the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, an increase of $47 million compared with March. Cash from operations was $317 million in the quarter, up $75 million sequentially over the March quarter and free cash flow was $308 million. In the quarter, we paid $80 million in dividends and repurchased $168 million of shares of our common stock in the period. We also made a supplemental payment beyond the required loan amortization of approximately $20 million towards our outstanding term loans in Q4. Additionally in July, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized an increase in the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share, the seventh increase in our regular dividend since it was first instituted in 2005. We believe this reflects the board and management's confidence in our long-term growth strategies and target business model and is consistent with our ongoing focus of returning value and rewarding our long-term stockholders for their commitment to KLA-Tencor. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the September quarter is bookings are expected to be within a range of $450 million to $650 million but our current view that the second half of calendar year 2015 is roughly flat with the first half, shipments of $610 million to $690 million, revenue between $595 million and $655 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.66 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to questions. We do once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to re-queue for your follow up questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permit. So, Connor, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot. I guess first thing, Bren, just to clarify something you just said. You said calendar second half flat with calendar first half. You mean shipments, is that right? So that would imply that shipments in December are like $800 million?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: No, I meant orders, Tim.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Orders? Okay.
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The order profile for the second half of the year is in line with the first half of the year. Obviously, we're seeing the seasonal effects in September with strengthening.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Then I guess just a big picture question for Rick. So I'm just looking back at, if I strip out the service number, if I just assume that service grows a bit and I look at just your systems revenue for September, it's as low as it's really ever been since the 2009 downturn. Nobody else is really anywhere close to that. So I guess from a strategic point of view, obviously, right now, you guys aren't super exposed to some of the 3D NAND things that are happening. And whenever in the past we've talked about maybe getting exposure to that area, maybe via partnership with a films company, at the time the argument was that you wanted to remain independent process neutral third-party. But does that logic hold anymore? Do you think that now given some of the changes in device architecture that maybe it does makes sense for a process control company to work together or merge or combine with a films company? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think there's definitely benefit in working closely with process equipment providers in terms of helping create products and processes and solutions that support some of the challenges customers face. But it's actually a pretty broad spectrum. I think that, as a company, we actually do partner with a number of players both in etch and dep, and have found ways to create value. I think that's very different than putting two companies together and so we still don't see the value or the strategic – the way you get the investment back if you were to pursue that path. So the M&A front hasn't changed but definitely there is interest in people using metrology and inspection to leverage their process equipment. And to your point, this is a very soft spot for us given the foundry and logic exposure we have and the fact that there's just not a lot of investment going on with those customers right now. We do anticipate that that will come back when we get into the 10-nanometer ramp which we think happens in calendar 2016 but certainly right now it's a soft spot for us.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, guys. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about second half orders equivalent to first half orders. Last call, you articulated a view of shipments and revenue second half being relatively balanced. Based on your commentary today, it seems like second half is going be lower now even with December quarter inflection. So I guess first question is, is that a fair statement? And it sounds like most of this is foundry push-outs. So if you could just help us, is this more 14-nanometer, 16-nanometer FinFET push-outs or is it more the legacy 28-nanometer technology?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren. Your assessment is correct. From an order perspective, we think it lines up fairly consistent with what we had seen last quarter. But certainly, shipments and revenue, we did have some sizable shipments that pushed out of the revenue forecast in the second half of the year for sub-20-nanometer foundry activity that is the largely responsible for the reduced outlook in terms of our views on shipments and revenue into the second half of the year.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then your one large logic customer pushed out the timing of their 10-nanometer high volume production ramp by about a year. On the flipside, though, it does seem like the other two major foundry suppliers are still aggressively going to try and rollout 10-nanometer next year. How has this sort of changed your view on 2016, and the 10-nanometer contribution to the business? You mentioned 10-nanometer development tools shipping in the first half. Is this going to be more foundry or logic biased?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's a little early to call 2016 at this point. I mean, clearly, our view is, is that we'll see the 10-nanometer ramp again in the first half of the 2016, so you'll start to see activity there. Order timing is always a question in when you'd see those orders. On the logic side, we tend to get a little bit more lead-time than we do on the foundry. So in terms of how we're looking at how the shipments roll out, I think the shipments roll out largely consistent across both segments but it's a little bit early at this point. But I don't think our view is – we talked a lot about it at SEMICON a couple weeks ago, I don't think our views around 10-nanometer interest and timing have changed all that much. It's just that's hard for me to see how you see any of that activity begin in this calendar year from a – you might start to see some orders at the tail end but certainly don't expect to see any shipments in 2015 for that.
Harlan L. Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them. First one, did you guys say that you expect some of your gen five optical inspection orders in the second half or is it more tied to 10-nanometer?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Krish, it's Bren. I don't know if it's tied exactly to 10-nanometer. It's really tied to the timing of those introductions. Typically, new products create their own weather in terms of timing of interest by customers. We would expect to see orders in the – toward the end of our fiscal year. And perhaps we'll see some revenue, too, towards the tail end. I don't think you fully see full scale sort of ramp and adoption until you move into the second half of 2016 but we should see some activity in the first half.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Krish, as you know, with a new product it's often the case that that is shipped and it's under contingency provision that when it achieves the milestones that you both recognize the revenue and the bookings. So less likely to see the bookings in the first half of the fiscal year because of that.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got you. And then a follow up for Bren. If I took at your June quarter, over the last six months your OpEx is down 7% from December. I mean you guys have done a 10% head count. The June quarter numbers look similar to your target model. So is it fair to assume that you already started seeing the benefits of the restructuring or is there still more room to cut cost here?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it's fair to assume we're starting to see some of it. Part of our assessment of where we were on a normalized basis, we were trending before we started the actions. And when I say normalized, I mean in terms of how you think about variable compensation adjustments and so on, somewhere around $225 million a quarter. And we see that trending down in terms of a fully loaded operating level of about $205 million to $210 million and we should see that progression across the fiscal year from here. So I think there's still room from where we're at now as we start to see those – some of those costs come off the books over the next quarter or so. And then we expect it to stay in that ballpark with some of the other actions that we have planned and are in process of executing.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. And apologies for the voice. Curious your thoughts on 10-nanometer. We heard from one of your competitors talking about capacity being brought online in 2016 through 2018. And roughly 150,000 wafer starts versus, call it, 250,000 at 16, 14, 20, and 300,000 wafer 28. And would love to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes in terms of rising intensity but elongation of the node and smaller amount of wafer starts and what that means for annualized spend at the next node.
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, C.J., we haven't done the work on how we're looking at 10-nanometer starts. I mean, clearly, what we've seen so far in the sub-20-nanometer is not a lot of end-market movement towards 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, which obviously impacts that start level. So depending on the level of adoption that you do see obviously will impact what customers are able to do as they move to 10-nanometer. But so far at 20-nanometer outside of a couple high volume products, haven't seen a lot of activity which has enabled customers to use some of those tools at 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer. So a lot of it, I think, depends on not only the end-market activity but also the competitive dynamics at that node that drives ultimately the overall size of it. So we think 10-nanometer will be a bigger node, given that it's – you have a full shrink to that node and that the ability to reuse tools if – is not the same as it was at 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer given that you had effectively the same back end process is at 20-nanometer down to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer. So we're optimistic about 10-nanometer both from a competitive dynamic front but also from an end-market front at this point.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, just to add a little color. The one thing we have seen is more starts in our work with the mask shops, we've seen more 10-nanometer designs than we might have thought at this time. And it does appear to be true that the fabless guys view 10-nanometer, kind of to Bren's point, because it's more of a shrink, it's actually being more of a real node and more advantageous to go to. And I think that that was part of what happened to 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer. So we see that. The negative of course is people have not yet really determined how difficult it's going be in terms of the ability to get yield and the impact that will have on all the cost per wafer. So I think you might see cost per transistor come down if people can figure out the yield challenges. But the negative to that is we saw an earlier player push it out and partly due to some of those challenges. So we think there's going to be interest in getting designs going and hence a bigger node but the timing is harder to predict. And we know there's been push lately.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: That's very helpful. And as a quick follow up, I guess, a short term question, given the lower utilization at many foundries, how do you think about your service revenue trajectory into the back half of the year?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, C.J., that tends to be pretty linear. I don't expect to see an acceleration there. I expect to see it continue along the trajectory that we've seen, somewhere between 6% and 8% per year and growing quarter-on-quarter generally.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, part of what's happening of course, as you know is some of the fabs being extended longer that aren't at the leading edge. So if you look at the contribution that the service business from the very leading-edge and even some places where the utilization is slightly lower, it's actually to Bren's point, it responds slower. So we're seeing pretty good signs out of our service and our interactions with customers. Plus, we've identified a number of places where we can do upgrades and give more productivity to those customers to give us some upward pressure on the growth rate.
C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. If you look at gross margin relative to your competitors, your margins are about 10 to 15 points higher. And your competitors are saying, while true, their revenue growth is better. So sort of implying that there's a direct relationship between margins and top line growth. And I'm curious what your take is. Do you feel that gross margins at these levels are holding back the revenue growth to a certain extent?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's a great question and one that we've reviewed over time. I think the challenge is it doesn't appear to be the case that demand for process control is elastic. So if you were to offer – if you were to reduce prices, there's no evidence to support that there'd be more business there. I think people find the level they want to be at in terms of investing to get their process to ramp and to keep it under control. And they're going to pay for that with based on the returns they get. Whereas in a process situation, if I'm getting designed in at a node and the customer has a very strong view of how many they're going buy, they're in a very good position to negotiate that price over the life of that particular node. And I think that's why you don't see the expansion, margin expansion for process equipments near the same way that we have it. And it's harder for them to get that beneficial pricing. With us, it's really a question of, if you need it. And if you don't need it, you're not going to buy it. And if you do need it, it's going to be a value exchange and that's where we see the strength in our business model.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Rick, on that point, you have talked about market share which you ceded a couple points last year. And I know the expectation internally is that you'd like to grow share. So does margins and pricing play a role in improving your share in process control at the time?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It hasn't historically. And the reason I say that is we've never been tool for tool low cost and competed on price. What we have to do is differentiate on performance and if the performance is there, we can typically, we can have higher productivity than the alternative but since we don't really make the same tools, when we look at our tool compared with our competitors, they're not the same tools. They are different approaches, different technologies. The most extreme example would be gen five against the e-beam alternative that's out there. So if we can demonstrate capability and higher productivity, it's again not a function of price. So what we're not going to do is chase the markets where it's based on a pricing decision because that's not consistent with our model. So this is why we invest heavily in R&D to have that differentiation. So two things we say. One, you got to have differentiation and the differentiation has to matter to the customers in a way that they see benefit in buying it and we think there are those opportunities for us.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Terrific. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Yes. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Rick, I want to go back to the 10-nanometer commentary. There seems to be some confusion out there as to how the die size, not so much of the cost per transistor is going to change. Based on the tape-outs you've seen, do you have any color, anything you can share with us as how the die size is going be impacted by adverse impact of multi-patterning? And I'm referring to over-provisioning that limits the die size shrink? And is there a factor that is going to somewhat reduce the scaling that we're all hoping to have in the 10-nanometer? And I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've seen a range. As you know, when you think about advanced design roles for logic or for the foundry market, often one of the biggest drivers for those tends to be, it has been historically FPGAs, which tend to utilize large die. And I think that for those they're still going to be pushing performance and wanting scaling but there are a number of other chips of course that are going to drive various ranges of die size. So we've not heard that. I think it's an astute insight but we have not heard that as being a limiter for the 10-nanometer rollout as we've seen these increased number of designs. But to your point, it's also pretty early. So we haven't. I think it's still early days.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: And this is my follow up question. The reason I ask is, when we migrated from 28 to 20-, there was some yield challenges and despite lower wafer start, you were actually able to do relatively okay. And it was much better environment than converting, than migrating to sub-20. And now that we're a year or so away from 10-nanometer, is it true shrink? And I'm just wondering if some of the opportunities would go away? Is this something that we're going to learn more about the impact of die size at 10-nanometer? Are we going to learn that when wafers come out of the pilot line in the spring timeframe? Or are you going to be able to provide some color by October timeframe?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't know how much color we'll have by October but I can give you my take on the last migration. I think a lot of what happened was, as we know now, looking back, 20-nanometer, we did do reasonably well going to 20-nanometer but it didn't carry over to 16-nanometer because as we went to 16-nanometer, of course we were left with reuse. I think the challenge in 10-nanometer is for customers it is a full shrink so they're going be challenged by that. But then as we think about 7-nanometer, the question is, are they going to have reuse opportunities there? And so part of the way we plan on addressing that is with new products. And I think the new products will give us this catalyst for driving new capability and creating more of an opportunity for us to grow.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna International Group: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. Rick, a question on your December outlook. You're looking for a pretty substantial increase in order in December. Can you give us a little bit of color on what's driving that? Is it order for the new product you're looking at or is there segment specifically that's driving the order growth because we kind of know that 10-nanometer is a little bit far out.
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Mahesh, it's Bren. So in terms of how we're sizing, I mean I'm not really guiding the December quarter as I said. It looks roughly flat in terms of half to half, so strengthening into December. We think obviously memory continues to be solid but we do expect to see some foundry activity start to pick up in the December quarter as well. There's some timing of some trailing edge projects that are out there that looks like we might see some of that activity start to book in the December timeframe. So, a combination of things across a couple of segments that gives us confidence around December being a solid increase versus September at this time.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And then a follow up on that, the – usually you have a much longer lead-time but it has been shrinking for a while. If you see order pickup in December, I would say the – is the shipment pickup – significant shipment pickup happens in March or is it something that can happen in December?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It tends to be customer-specific. So harder to say at this point. I'm not sure I can guide the second half shipment profile right now.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just, I guess, follow up question on the memory order, very strong this quarter and you guys attributed that to 3D NAND. But I understand some of your customers might be looking to convert planar NAND fab to 3D NAND rather than doing greenfield. To the extent that they do that, is that a lot of reuse can happen and would that kind of limit your opportunity on the NAND side?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: In the quarter, we had – 3D NAND was solid. Also we had some DRAM activity that was good as well. I think you're going to see some conversions but most of the activity that we're seeing so far is more greenfield focused.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It also has more variation. I mean 3D NAND inherently doesn't necessarily have a lot more process control intensity but the decision by our customers to upgrade or try to reuse often depends more on the age of the fleet and what's out there and when they did their last process control buys. So memory was pretty soft for a while so there'd become more opportunities and when they're spending we're on the list of opportunities that they're looking at. So it's not quite as simple as their reuse because in those cases, the memory guys have invested at a lower level historically than we saw in foundry.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That was good color. And then my follow up question is on 10-nanometer. Our understanding is that there's a change – and obviously when you go to 10-nanometer we have more multi-patterning steps and I understand there's a pretty big step-up in the number of patterning steps. How are you guys capitalizing on that opportunity with this new organization focusing on patterning?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well I think that part of what customers are looking at as they look ahead is the metrology challenges both the – and really starting with the definition of the patterns with mask, and the interactions that you see on multi-patterning, how much the pressure there is on the overlay budget and film controls budget is they're really looking for the ability to synthesize and integrate the different tools in the portfolio. We're now organizationally set up in a much better way to support that because it's really aligning with our customers and many of our customers you'll find someone who is the exact counterpart to the new organizations that we've set up. So we're in a better position to support that as opposed to them having to deal with three or four different representatives from different divisions. So the customer response to our reorg has been just flat out either very good or really good. Because I think, from their standpoint, it's just better. It's easier for them to deal with. So I think that gives us opportunity. And then of course we have the products in place but we're pretty well aligned with the 10-nanometer challenges. And there is a huge push for increase overlay control as they go down to 10-nanometer and the fear of what that is going to look like in terms of some of the errors induced starting with how the mask look.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. That's good color. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Redstone Research. Your line is open.
Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research: Yeah, thanks so much for taking my question, Rick. It's two questions. First, I just wanted to understand ASML has been pushing its EUV to its logic customers and several customers, just wanted to understand what is the status of the EUV mask inspection as ASML plans to ship several tools over the next 18 months to a major logic customer. I know you had kind of scaled back a little bit on the EUV. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we think we have a pretty compelling answer to reticle verification for EUV but it doesn't require an EUV reticle tool. It requires the 6xx platform that we have and our ability to do print check on devices once they're printed. And so, from our perspective, that is the answer to support the customers as they go through and the degree with which they adopt EUV. We're already supporting that in terms of the work that's going on in the reticle tool. And then we can support it when they printed on the actual wafer, so that is our answer.
Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research: Okay. Thank you. And just a follow up, I just wanted to understand fundamentally if you look at all the patterning opportunities that your competitors, like, Lam and Applied have laid out in terms of their growth in the patterning step, you would imagine that etch and deposition which are intensive for several of these applications would definitely need process control. Just wanted to get your thoughts into why the process control market hasn't really grown as one would have imagined? Is there anything that we are missing something like that? I'd appreciate your input on that.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think it's much more a function right now of the mix between memory and what we're seeing in terms of customers investing in memory versus investing in logic. In logic and foundry, our intensities are pretty good. It's just those customers are in a bit of an air pocket right now for us whereas the most of the investment has been along memory where there's also multi-patterning opportunities but that's – when you breakdown our process control intensities by different technologies, whether it's memory, logic, or foundry, that shift to higher percentage of memory is really explains the shift in our demand environment.
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, we're pretty comfortable with what we're seeing on foundry, logic intensity changes node to node. I think the biggest issue right now is, is that you are dealing with very similar tool sets at 20-nanometer and below and so the ability to migrate the capacity that was acquired for 20-nanometer down to 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer with no backfill of design tape-outs where that capacity has enabled customers to reuse some of that equipment. But in terms of the intensity that we've seen on those purchases, it is in line with what we were expecting to see at 1x.
Jagadish Iyer - Redstone Technology Research: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you very much. Yes. Sorry about that. Rick, kind of a bigger question in terms of multiple patterning and traditionally where you get process control intensity. Do you ever see more and more double, multiple patterning steps that should drive increasing I guess process control intensity that you've seen the foundry, logic space? I guess why hasn't the DRAM space or the memory guys adopted more process control, I guess in line with that transition?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, so there's two things if you think about process control. One is around the metrology space and the other one is around the defectivity space. And if you remember our SEMICON West presentation, we talked about in patterning, our market share's probably in the 40% range. So the capital intensity is higher in patterning and our share is not particularly strong and it hasn't actually gone up that much in memory for process control intensity. The other side though is defectivity, and defectivity for multi-patterning doesn't really depend so much on multi-patterning as much as it does on the device type. So you're making memory. These guys are almost at 100% repair when it comes to DRAM. And so you're not going to see as much and we haven't for many, many years see the adoption as high in DRAM. And then 3D is a different decision because, for them, because there they really want 3D capability to look through the stacks and that technology just doesn't exist. So it's more a function of the process control intensity on defectivity and our market share in terms of the patterning and the relatively lower level of intensity and patterning as well in terms of what we see in memory. So really those combination of factors. Does that make sense?
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: No, that's actually really helpful. And maybe again a bigger picture question for you. There's been a lot of chatter and one of your largest customers talked about Moore's Law cadence being kind of pushed out. From your perspective, maybe both for KLA specific and process control, how does that change where they've talked about 2 to 2.5 years potentially impact you guys?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're pretty dependent on node transition. So obviously if that pushes out, then we end up in a soft spot like we're in right now. Really the question is when, for us, the real question coming up is the 10-nanometer adoption because our belief is we're going to be in a relatively softer position for the next quarter and then we'll start seeing some improvement in the December timeframe. But what we're going to have to depend on is the 10-nanometer is going to happen in calendar 2016. Then the question is how much of a stretch is it from 10 to 7 and what's beyond that. It's pretty hard to say at this point.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to understand a little bit of the shipment profile of the 3D NAND orders that you received in the June quarter. Is it pretty much timed in September quarter or is it going to be spread out over next few quarters?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think around that segment most of those orders will ship in the next, over the course of September and into December. So lead times being three to six months on those tools.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. And then one high level question, like if we just look at like the yield problems that are going on, in whatever segment we look at there are yield challenges that are kind of slowing down the ramp plans, like we hear about DRAM 20-nanometer being like an issue for a lot of customers. And 3D NAND obviously is having issues and in foundry, since it doesn't seem like yields are progressing as well as people would like. So the question really is like despite the yields being challenged, why are we not seeing like an increase in process control intensity as one would have imagined like a few years ago? It seems to me like whenever you have yield challenges, process control used to benefit. Is there some change going on here? And is there a different way that we need to think about when yield challenges are there and not just in the process control segments that KLA is serving here?
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah well, I think if you recall, we laid out the process control intensity model over a year ago at SEMICON and talked about the difference between what we'd see at foundry and logic and what we'd see in memory. And the biggest change in terms of our demand environment has really been associated with the shift toward an increase in memory concentration, which inherently, although the new nodes have more process control intensity than the prior nodes, they're almost half of what you see in logic and foundry. The logic and foundry intensities have been in general okay, but what we've seen recently is logic is almost at a historic low in terms of at least for the last 10 years, their investment right now is they're on pause. The other thing that happens is in foundries they might have a big focus on yield, but if then the business isn't won then what we see is the investment then stops altogether because it went somewhere else. So we have experienced some of that as well.
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, Farhan, the only other thing I would add to that is, is that so far, the process control intensity in a high mix foundry is higher than, let's say, a high volume logic fab. And given the level of activity we've seen with design starts at so far 20, 14, 16, most of the behavior has been more in line with high volume logic-like adoption levels where customers are running high volume products. And so end market activity is a driver of process control adoption. And the limited end-market activity so far has had an impact on the intensity for sure.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA. Your line is open.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you have any view on the order mix for calendar 3Q?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes, so for September, it looks like 43% memory and foundry 35%, logic 22%.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Got it. And then where do we stand on the buyback and when do you expect to complete that authorization?
Bren D. Higgins - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we've got in excess of 8 million shares remaining on the authorization. We repurchased $168 million in the June quarter. So we see a continuation over the course of the year, now approach is to do, what we call, a dollar cost average-like approach towards that over time. And so we'll continue to do it quarter in, quarter out. Certainly, we – as we manage our overall cash relative to our U.S. target, it does have an impact in terms of cash needs and in terms of where we ultimately end up around share repurchases. And we are going to start to pay down the debt. We've started to do that in the last quarter and so that will be an aspect to the cash management going forward as well. So we're about halfway through, a little over halfway through and we'll see it continue over the course of the next 12 months or so.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Americas LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks. Just a follow up question on the impact of Intel's CapEx cadence change. It wasn't clear to me, does this impact how you run KLA at all? Do you maybe throttle back manufacturing output? Or is the impact just not that meaningful since logic has been, I think you said, a smaller part of your orders recently? Thanks.
Richard P. Wallace - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, obviously if anyone is reducing their CapEx and our sensitivity to process control intensity is higher in foundry and in logic than it is in memory, that's we don't consider that a great thing, so that dials us back a little bit. If you think about the restructuring that we did, we talked about two motivators. One was to position the company better to deal with our customer challenges to get to market and be easier for our customers to deal with us. But the other side of that was to reduce our cost base, and we've done that. And if you look at where we are from the peak, we're down pretty significantly. So our view is that, in the event that this continues, we want to be positioned appropriately for our investments to support it. But we never know how long these things are going to go. There are many examples in the past where customers give one direction and then change directions based on the way things go. And we're prepared for either one. But I think that we have taken actions to deal with, for us, what was a lower end market demand environment than we would have hoped for a couple years ago, but we also think that, in 2016, we will see a resumption of the investment.
Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks for sharing that, Rick.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood.
Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations: Thank you, Connor. On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us here today.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Stephanie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Stephanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2015. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement this earnings call, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the EPS guidance and other supplemental financial information. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There, you’ll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you’ll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause these differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, including our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today’s call. KLA-Tencor delivered another quarter of solid financial performance in Q3 driven by our market leadership, our innovative portfolio of process control solutions and strong operational execution. Financial results for Q3 were inline with our expectations, revenue in the quarter grew 9% sequentially finishing above the midpoint of our guidance at $738 million. And non-GAAP earnings per share came in at the upper end of the range at $0.84 per share driven by lower operating expenses in the period. New orders also finished in the upper end of the range of guidance in Q3 at $692 million. These results are a good start for KLA-Tencor in calendar 2015 reflecting continued solid execution against our strategic objectives and the benefits of our ongoing focus on innovation and market leadership. In fact, our latest industry market share data shows KLA-Tencor delivered another year of strong market leadership in the most critical areas of process control in calendar 2014 demonstrating success in our customer focus initiatives and the value of our portfolio of process control solutions. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is addressing our customers most critical yield challenges and the various technology transitions underway in the marketplace today including multi-patterning, new device architecture such as FinFET and 3D NAND. Turning now to our perspective on the current market environment and thoughts on the industry landscape for the remainder of calendar 2015, first I think it's important to remind to everyone that setting aside the seemingly never ending stream of conflicting signals and uncertainty as to the magnitude and timing of near term investment in the leading edge, equipment demand is generally healthy and our customers continue to drive their long-term strategies for growth led by major technology inflections at the leading edge. But over the consolidated customer base, demand for leading edge logic and foundry limited to one or two large customers in the initial phases of a new node, the continued high class of next generation node transitions, we have come to accept a higher degree of volatility and quarterly demand, shorter leading times and the result of low visibility in the demand environment as just being part of our industry today. But even with these factors and with caveats related to the timing of investments in the year, we still expect 2015 to be a solid - a solid demand for the equipment industry. With investment levels forecasted to be on par with what we saw in 2014 and with the potential for modest industry growth depending on the timing of some of the larger capacity RAMs that are expected in the second half of the year. In terms of our view of the end markets, we see memory investment initially focused on 20-nanometer conversions in DRAM followed by increasing 3D NAND investment in the second half of calendar 2015. The primary focus of investment for foundry in 2015 continues to be FinFET development and capacity ramp for a number of customers in addition to fill in capacity demand for 28-nanometer. We also expect our R&D and pilot investment for the 10-nanometer design node to begin picking up in the second half of the calendar year. In this environment, process control plays a critical role enabling the successful execution of our customer's growth strategies creating opportunity for KLA-Tencor and fuelling our long-term growth. As the market leader in process control, we would expect revenue growth at least in line with the industry in the year. In KLA-Tencor, we have an ongoing process for evaluating the company's progress in our long-term strategic objectives of customer focus growth, operational excellence and talent development. Our goal in successfully executing these strategies is to deliver consistent growth, strong cash flows and profitability and sustain market leadership over the long-term with superior returns to our stockholders. We believe our ability to proactively get ahead of shifting customer and market dynamics as one of KLA-Tencor’s competitive strength and a key differentiator for the company. Consistent with this ongoing process, today we announced a plan to reduce our global employee workforce by up to 10%. This action and previous organizational alignment actions are aimed at streamlining our organization NAND business processes in response to the changing customer requirements in our industry. Our efforts are directly - are directed and improving efficiency and removing complexity throughout our organization, streamlining our customer focus strategies and better integrating our R&D and product introduction processes. The goal of these efforts is to deliver an increased capacity for investment in innovation and market leadership and direct our resources toward our best opportunities while enabling improved earnings power over time. Example of various we have identified for future realignment of investment priorities includes scaling back our investment in EUV, as well as consolidating our customer facing organizations and our go-to-market strategies to better match the consolidated customer base. We will continue to make the strategic investments necessary to fuel our long-term growth strategies and we’ll also continue to proactively evaluate and adjust our plans as appropriate. Regarding the headcount reductions we are announcing today, we are currently finalizing the details and specifics of these actions and we will have more information and details in the weeks to come. In closing, long-term growth for KLA-Tencor is driven by the strong pace of investment in next generation semiconductor device technologies by the market leaders in logic, foundry, and memory. Process control plays a critical role in helping these customers solve the mission critical production problems associated with managing yields in the leading edge manufacturing environment. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from these ever more complex and costly yield challenges. As we look ahead, we are energized by the opportunities that lie ahead and optimistic that 2015 promises to be an exciting year for KLA-Tencor. We are well positioned in key markets with innovative products to execute our strategies for growth in market leadership and to deliver strong returns to our stockholders. Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. New orders in June are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenue guidance for Q4 is in the range of $710 million to $790 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.78 to a $1.02 per share for the quarter. Before I conclude, I would like to thank the entire KLA-Tencor team for their continued hard work and dedication. As always, our driving focus remains on innovation and execution enabling us to meet complex customer requirements and deliver consistent solid financial results. As we move forward we will continue to support high levels of investment and innovation to drive our market leadership, generate improved operating leverage in our business and deliver strong returns to our stockholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the quarter before returning for Q&A. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks Rick and good afternoon. Revenue for Q3 was above the mid-point of guidance at $738 million and non-GAAP earnings per share finished at the upper end of the guided range for the quarter at $0.84 driven by higher revenue and lower than modeled operating expenses in the period. Fully diluted GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.81. The GAAP earnings per share in Q3 included $0.03 of acquisition, restructuring, severance and other related charges net of the income tax effect on these adjustments. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude these adjustments. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share can be found in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our website prior to this earnings call. Looking at the overall business environment, the landscape is similar to what we described back in January with shipments and revenue levels for KLA-Tencor expected to be generally balanced half over half in 2015 and what is now planned to be a year of modest growth for WFE. There are assumptions in the forecast that could impact the timing of results but the overall view that calendar 2015 will be a solid but not spectacular year for KLA-Tencor and for the industry remains the same today. New orders in Q3 were $692 million at the upper end of the range of guidance of $500 million to $700 million for the quarter. Foundry was 76% of new orders in Q3 and logic was 7%, memory bookings finished at 17% of new system orders in the period. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group, wafer inspection was approximately 39%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was approximately 22%, service was 26%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q3 were $715 million. Given current shipment backlog we expect shipment levels in the second half of calendar 2015 to be roughly equal to the levels in the first half. In total, we ended the quarter with just over $1.3 billion of total backlog comprised of $1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that have not shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Total backlog also includes $239 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been accepted by customers. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $738 million up 9% compared with Q2. Gross margin was 57% and in line with the guided range. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 58% in June driven by a more favorable mix of high end wafer inspection tools in the quarter. Looking ahead, our gross margin performance should continue to reflect our differentiated business model which is fueled by 60% to 70% incremental gross margins. Operating expenses were $218 million, down from $231 million in Q2 and below the guided range of $227 million to $229 million, a result of favorable variance and some discretionary budget in quarter and from our continuing focus on cost controls. The global employee workforce reduction plan announced today and previous organizational alignment action are intended to optimize our global business operations to maintain our leading market position, free up resources to direct investment on our most important customer and product development initiative and appropriately aligned our organization and business processes to fit in involving industry and customer landscape. We are currently modeling operating expenses for June quarter to be flat compared with March. At this time, we're enable to make a good faith determination of the cost estimates associated with the global employee workforce reduction plan and our June quarter GAAP EPS guidance does not consider the impact to these costs. We plan to update GAAP guidance once we have determined the earnings impact of the proposed plan. Other income and expense was a net expense of $29 million in March, and we expect OAE to be a net expense in the June quarter of approximately $28 million. The tax rate was 21.1% in Q3 and inline with the long term planning rate of 22%. Net income was $137 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended Q3 at $2.3 billion, we repurchase 2.6 million shares of stock and paid a dividend of $82 million in period, and cash from operations was strong at $242 million in a quarter. Lastly we ended Q3 with approximately $163 million fully diluted shares outstanding. I expect Q4 to end at approximately $160 million. In conclusion to reiterate our guidance for the June quarter is new orders are expected to be in range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenues expected in the range of $710 million to $790 million with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range $0.78 to $1.02 per share. This concludes our prepared remarks for today. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point we'd like to open the call to questions. We once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today’s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we’ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. Stephanie, we're ready for your question.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You line is open.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had was quickly, Bren, you mentioned that the second-half shipment should be similar to the kind of first half. What is your shipment guidance for June quarter? And I also had a follow-up after that.
Bren Higgins: Sure, Krish, the guidance for the June quarter, at the midpoint is up 12% to $800 million, so the guidance range is $760 million to $814 per shipment.
Krish Sankar: Got it, that is very helpful. And then a question for Rick as a follow-up. I am curious to know the thought process behind the 10% workforce reduction, because it looks like the industry spending is robust and you guys also said that you need to go in debt like six months ago. So why the reason for the cuts now that you are confident and seem to be doing it? Is this more a reaction to any kind of competitive situation, market share loss, or is it more looking at KLA specifically over the next 12 to 24 months?
Rick Wallace: Well it's actually looking at the industry over the next five years and thinking about how we should be structured and to provide answers to customer's challenges. So two things, one, as we know that industry has gotten a lot simpler in terms of customer consolidation and we have the luxury of being able to forward a relatively expensive go-to-market strategy which we are streamlining in this. The second one is our product divisions, we'd had number of product divisions and for while that made a lot of sense for most of company's history, but we think now that in – as what we're seeing now from our customers is really request for a solutions across products and our ability to do that means we streamline those product divisions, let's say, you end up with a fair amount of excess capacity in terms of management to support that. And so we end up being streamlined in terms of our go-to-market but also our product development. So it's really reflection of what's going on in the industry and the result is we end up being in a position where we're going to have the reduction of some of the talent that’s been in the company.
Krish Sankar: Thanks Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. A couple of things. Rick, I guess - this is just a big picture question, but I'm just looking at your WFE share. And in 2014 you lost about 50 bps of WFE share. And if the back half, revenue wise, is pretty similar to the front half of this year, you're going to lose another 50 bps roughly. And it seems like there is - that your lack of exposure to memory is becoming a real problem as a lot of the secular spending vectors are in memory. So I guess I wanted your opinion on is this finally the straw that sort of breaks the camel's back that forces you to get into the process business to gain some exposure to memory? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks, Rick.
Rick Wallace: Sure, Tim. So, let me start with no, this is not something that force us into process. I think what it does is - we have opportunities to create more value in memory and to increase the capital intensity, but we don't necessarily - we haven't delivered those solutions yet to the market. And some of those memory processes are inherently less process control intensive and we know that. So there is some opportunity for growth there. And we also as we model it out, we do think we are in a secular part of the, I guess, that the industry where memory is going to be higher, but not forever. And so when we model this we'd say, yes 2015 continues to be probably more memory heavy then if you go back three or four years, but we think that trend will swing particularly when we start seeing investment in next generation technologies as in the 10-nanometer node for logic and for process which have been delayed. Then we'll expect to see foundry come into balance and we'll see opportunities to grow relative to the market. We think we hold to the market overall this year but we have chances for growth as we go forward. Bren, you want to add any color to that.
Bren Higgins: No, I think, Tim, within the segment itself, our market share position is very strong. And so we're comfortable with our positioning but obviously as you know memory isn't our strongest hand so every WFE dollars is not created equal in terms of the impact on our business. So while we're - I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the share front memory and some of the opportunities to increase adoption, the adoption is not going to ever get to where foundry and logic is. So we think that once foundry and logic begins to invest in earnest and some of the technology transition that Rick mentioned, we feel pretty good about our relative performance at that point.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, great. And then, a just quick follow-up to that, Bren you had guided, I have my notes, last call you said, that you saw orders in the first calendar half of this year would be about flat with the calendar second half of the last year, which is implying that orders in June would be like 825 something like that now even if I adjust for March being a bit better, being above the range, it seems like roughly $100 million pushed out of the first half of this year from the order perspective, can you talk about what that was?
Bren Higgins: So, once again the specific customer situations but I was expecting more for at least from an order perspective, more 10-nanometer activity to start to show itself from the June quarter and that looks like that's delaying now to the second half of the years. I'd see principally that's the biggest piece of the change.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Bill Peterson: Good afternoon this is Bill Peterson for Harlan. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Piggybacking on the move towards 10-nanometer, as you talked about, it's really limited to a few players at the moment, but as we look ahead, what is your view on capital intensity uplift for process control as we compare to, say, 14, 16, or 20, the combined node. And related, how should we think about the reuse of equipment when transitioning between these advanced nodes? Thanks for your insight on that.
Bren Higgins: Sure. The 10-nanometer process intensity we have some models for it but until it really happens, its going to be hard to validate those models because we're still early in terms of people's development for it. But we did have model that we laid out and we can talk to the specifics of that in a minute. In terms of the transition and the reuse issue, I think that its pretty clear in cases like the 20 to 16-nanometer transition you do see the opportunity for customers to have fair amount of reuse depending on the back end of the process and how much change there. So far that's part of it, but the other do they maintain the 20-nanometer line going and so reuse gets, I think you see more pronounced if the volume on the 20-nanometer decreases when they go to 16, does that make any sense. So 10 we think is entirely a different case more like the transition from 28 to 20 then it from 20 to 16 and so we expect more intensity as a result of that we're looking for some of that data and the specifics here inside. Yes, so the way we laid it out, I don't think we feel, we feel very comfortable with the data at least on the foundry logic side that what we consider one exit in below which included 20-nanometer was in excess of 18% on logic foundry. So to Rick's point, I think the biggest issue is very similar toolsets from 20 to 16, 14 with the same lithography, the biggest question was going to be the size of the node and the number of designs and therefore the ability to migrate capacity. So to the point earlier with very little activity, 20-nanometer beyond couple of customers, customer were able to migrate capacity down to 16 and so, so I think that's the dynamic that we're seeing. But we're comfortable with the 18% as Rick said early on 10 and so I think we'll save that for another day and depending on how you to that earlier question, depending on how you one day gets to this total, but with memory blended at 40% to 45% which is probably where it is this year. You're probably sub 14% -14.5% or so on that range between 14% and 15%, but we will see how it plays out through the year.
BillPeterson: Thanks for that color. My follow-up, and switching gears to memory, we are getting closer to 3D NAN adoption as we witnessed from a lot of the press releases out there. We would expect, of course, more [caption depth] [ph] intensity with reuse of a lithography. But can you give us an updated view on what your customers are standing to require from a process control perspective and how it compares to 15-, 16-nanometer Planar? I guess presumably areas like [indiscernible] OCD stress become more intensive but what about some other areas, inspection overlay and things like that? Thanks for the insight.
Bren Higgins: Sure. I would say it is more intensive in metrology than it is inspection when you look at the transition of 3D. There are couple of areas for opportunity and inspection, there's definitely opportunity when it comes to majoring, inspecting films and especially buying films and there's a big desire to keep those process as clean given the stat. So you do have opportunities there because angles are relaxed, you have less intensity associated with advanced wafer inspection expect for in the development phase, so you do see it there but not as much in production. Metrology is kind of where the action is though, because there is so much in terms of number of players requirements, round overlay and film measurement, so we do see big opportunity in terms of what's going on in the metrology. And so, in aggregate you do get an increase and the intensity, but it still is significantly what we see in the logic foundry. But the rate of increases similar to what we see in the rate increase in logic foundry, but the intensity is probably modeled, it was about half of that what you see in large foundry. So, we’re matching subject to the shift for memory to logic or logic memory than we are necessary node to node, where we do see increased adoption associated with the advance node.
BillPeterson: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Good luck.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First just wanted to ask if you had a new investment program from your customers to move forward with actinic UV mass inspection, how quickly could you ramp that program up and does that potentially impact your workforce layoff plan?
Bren Higgins: I guess, we are having the lot of conversations with customers about that and nothing has really changed in terms of the customer sentiment around the need and timing of actinic inspection. So as soon as I think we see any capacity being available, should it get funded is 2019 and at this point we don't see a lot of appetite for that given the relative low adoption in terms of EUV and the production. So what we do see here, we have some recent examples of some plans as you know to do, cut mask, but 6XX product line that we have there can service that and service those needs and it is going to be utilize to do that. So the answer remains the same, its probably four to five years if we were to get funding we don't anticipate that happening any time soon and the talent that one would need to do that is not necessarily the talent that is - we’re viewing as part of a transition to this linear structure as we go forward. And so from that standpoint it really has no bearing on actions that we are taking now.
Weston Twigg: Okay, that's helpful. And just secondly, Intel announced a large CapEx reduction this year from its forecast, largely based on equipment reuse as we migrate from 22- to 14-nanometer. That's a full node transition, so traditionally you wouldn't have had a lot of impact from equipment reuse and I'm wondering if that's a little different this time around? Are you seeing much reuse from that 22-nanometer node at Intel?
Rick Wallace: Not given the specific customers in terms of how that's moving, but I think if you look at the reduction in CapEx there and the reduction in CapEx from TSMC, we had about $2 billion of CapEx come out of the market. So about $1 billion of that was WFE and at the intensity levels we described earlier represents probably somewhere around - somewhere between $100 million and $150 million of KLA-Tencor opportunity given our share in the intensities I mentioned. So, clearly those push-outs had an effect on our business as we look at the year. There is probably some opportunities for some upside out there, I think has happened around 10-nanometer or strengthening in some of the memory markets but recent terms however we see it today its hard to ignore that impact in terms of the - the impact on CapEx and the customer behavior we're seeing as a result of that. On the reuse from 22 to 16, I think it's the same thing. I think in some way I think - the ability to extent certain tools, metrology requirements are different, so there is some there - customers always try to do that. I think at this note, I think its particularly a little bit more, there is more reuse but in general its always - they always attempt to use more and it really depends on how much of that process is changing through the front end, back end.
Weston Twigg: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chelsea Jurman: Hi, this is Chelsea Jurman on behalf of Jim. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like you are now expecting WFE to be flat or up slightly and that this is going to be determined by the second half. Relative to where you provided your initial guidance for 2015, where are you seeing the most upside, and where is there the biggest risk to the downside?
Rick Wallace: That's the way we are seeing it right now and as I said I think upside is related to foundry logic 10-nanometer and Volume-NAND. I think that on downside there, I think is all publicly related to how much end market demand we actually see start to come into play around 16 to 14 and what does that do to drive more capacity I would say - absent the broader sort of macro issues that are out there that's how we would see it.
Chelsea Jurman: Got it. And then in terms of growing in line with the market in 2015 or in line with the industry, would you say that your forecast for industry growth has come down since the beginning of the year? And how is your growth impacted by the changing CapEx cuts at not only Intel but other big customers?
Rick Wallace: Yes I think we are inline with the rest of our peers around the views of the year and I think with the public announcements from two significant customers and our strongest space, or strongest segment that is certainly led us to moderate that view for the year.
Chelsea Jurman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you very much. Maybe as a follow-up to Wes' question for you, Rick, in terms of the mask inspection for EUV, how do you look at it from a KLA perspective in terms of the risk/reward, the investments? Will you only do it if you're going to get some of outside funding or is there something you can do if the customer demand is there to take on that project?
Rick Wallace: No, this is one where we need to work closely with the customers to make sure that A, the demand is there and the commitment is there because right now the uncertainty around the timing of high volume EUV makes this a very different kind of question in terms of the investment profile. Remember we build that tool and there is not a market for it, there is no other application for it. It can only be used for one thing which is to inspect EUV masks. And if you build advanced wafer inspection tool, it really only matters the people are making wafers and doesn’t really matter the technology they are making it with. So, for that reason we're coupled to our customers on this and talking closely with them about their needs and we'll develop in conjunction with them as we go forward. But to-date we have not seen compelling interest on their part to want to make that commitment.
Patrick Ho: Great; that's really helpful. And maybe, Bren, for you, in terms of some of the industry commentary you provided, particularly some of the pulls and pushes you're getting both on the FinFET 16-, 14-, and the 10-nanometers, do to see any pulls from your vantage point of -- or pushes and pulls from 14 to 16 being pushed out, but some customers trying to pull in 10 and accelerate that process? Is that something you could potentially see in the second half of the year in terms of additional 10-nanometer development in lieu of the capacity adds for 16 and 14.
Bren Higgins: I mean, I guess it's possible. What we've seen so far I think a continuation of what we've experience over the last couple of quarters and that's been a very measured pace of additional capacity adds for 14, 16. And so it's been a much more measured pace than we've seen in prior nodes and as a result on the margin we've had weaker sort of general results or order, orders and shipments. And so, as we look at beyond - who knows what's going to happen? I think there is some high profile potential announcements in the second half of the year and does that drive competitive dynamics that drive incremental capacity as possible. We are certainly living in environment today where we don't get a lead time visibility from our customers because our customers aren't getting it from there. So, I think we have the capacity to be flexible, the response to an uptick if it would happen. I mean, right now based on a commentary earlier and the way we're modeling is modest sort of up year for the industry and our performance in line with that.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you. Operator, read next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad: Thanks for take my question. My first question is regarding the OpEx that you announced. How should we think about the OpEx level, given that you're cutting your OpEx and should we think should be roughly about 10% cut from the OpEx level that you are currently at? And also how does the OpEx cut change your onshore versus offshore cash generation?
Rick Wallace: Good question. So, I think we'll have more to say about what are normalized targets are going to be as part of this, I mean part of action is really been driven by our strategic need in terms of how we're going to structure company, obviously it’s a more efficient structure and they'll be savings, but some of the savings will be redirected into some other things that we want to invest more in. I mean one very strong aspect of this reorganization is it's allow us to very easily capital across different projects to capitalized on opportunities in a more effective and expeditious way if you well. So I think that's certainly something that we’re looking at. In terms of a model, the way I'm think about is we take the current business levels which roughly equate to about an annualize level of $3 billion with fully loaded variable comp we will generating operating margins of about 30% and with the ability to be able to scale the business on revenue growth at 50 to 60 incremental operating margin off of that base. That's how we're modeling, but I think we're very early and we'll have more to say as we progress over the coming weeks towards SEMICON West.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you. And then in terms of the programs where you think some investment could be needed, can you just highlight like maybe like one or two areas where you think like which are very good growth opportunities for inspection where you maybe increasing the OpEx?
Rick Wallace: Well, I'll take this. There is two areas really, one is around – these are areas we'd emphasize more and recognize that to Bren's point we're modifying how much we're spending but where we would emphasize and move, really around the two solutions we have one is around patterning solutions, which we look at the opportunities to bring together and we've already introduce 5D which is our solution to really trying to help our customer managed the challenges of complex patterning. And so there's an elements of that that includes some of the design information as well as the overlay measurements of film thickness and stack and integrated that into complete solution that allows our customers to address the challenges they have. So investing in that is one, the other one is in our defect portfolio and part of the reason for these changes is integrating again some of the data that we see in design along with the information we find during inspection with some of the information we have in review and what we call fusion program and in that we take that information and it helps our defect discovery for our customers and allows them to accelerate their ramps and identifying and hunting down some of the challenges they face. So both of those are system solutions that our divisional structure didn’t necessarily inhibit but it certainly will be facilitated in this new structure in those areas we are certainly going to focus on big demand from our customers for that and we’re pretty excited about our ability to provide solutions there.
Farhan Ahmad: Thank you. That's all I have.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, similar to Tim's question, if I look at your PDC market share, it has been pretty stable and actually going up, but the PDC share as a percent of equipment spending WFE has been coming down from 8% to 9% to 7%. Can you talk about your opportunities in the non-semi-markets, the storage packing? Is there anything you can do, either organically or inorganically to know there?
Rick Wallace: Sure. We certainly have, we participate in what’s going on in some of the back end and packaging and so on. And we have opportunities for growth there but let me just caveat it by saying the size of that opportunity relative to the rest of the company doesn’t provide a meaningful uplift to our overall. But we think it’s more important is associated with the intensity of process control and foundry and memory and a big part of that transition as we know is the increased memory spend. We think that that comes back into balance, in the future we’re not exactly sure when and we think that once again provides our opportunity to go faster in the industry. We do see increased intensity as we go node to node, some of that is opportunity that will capture with our existing products and some of it is opportunity that we’re going to need new capability to capture and work minute above. So we’re not really looking outside of our core for to grow faster than the industry. We think we’ve got what we need inside, we just need to execute.
Atif Malik: Great. And, Bren, at SEMICON Analyst Day last year you talked about returning 100% of accessible free cash flow to shareholders and then post this restructuring move, is that still the plan?
Bren Higgins: Yes I mean I think the extra element in that is how we think about de-levering the - some of the debt that we brought on and we structured a component that debt with a term loan bank component that we have prepay ability to. So using 100% of the cash flow obviously we’ve got the ongoing dividend and that’s a different exercise in terms of how we think about the growth rate in that ongoing dividend relative to the growth rate in free cash flow of the company. And then the difference between the U.S. cash which is about 60% to 70% of the total less the ongoing dividend goes towards share repurchase and de-levering. So we’re committed to executing the share repurchase component of the recap announcement we made last fall and then beyond there I think my focus probably shifts more towards this beyond dilution more towards de-levering to my long-term leverage target at 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA.
Atif Malik: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Thank you very much. Just want to follow up on comment you guys made earlier that 20, 16, 14 node is not ramping as fast as you would have thought. And 20, it was supposed to be slow and I remember 28, when you ramped first, it was a huge year for you. You outperformed by 20% in that year, and we haven't seen that at 20, 16 and 14. So do you have some thoughts on what is happening in the marketplace with this particular node? If you consider this as a one-node, 20, 16, 14, and compare it to 28, why so much difference in these two nodes?
Bren Higgins: Well I think you mean the end market demand at 20-nanometer wasn’t particularly strong beyond in couple of quarters and so customers have the ability to migrate some of that capacity, we’ve seen that in the few areas to 14 16 given the similarities with part of the process. So I think having lumped them together is how we think about them and I think it’s probably a combination of factors and market demand, competitive dynamics and so on that we’re different and stronger perhaps 28-nanometer than what we’ve seen so far at 20 and below. That can change and change quickly but at least so far that’s the pattern we’ve seen and it’s the pattern we’ve seen over the last three quarters. So it’s not necessarily something different in terms of couple of quarters. We think that that lot of that capacity begins to ship and then we will start to see how the rest play of it plays out here as we move through June and into the second half of the year.
Mahesh Sanganeria: And one more question on your commentary on first half similar to second half, can you talk a little bit about what do you see in terms of the distribution of spending in shipment terms between logic and memory in the first half over second half?
Bren Higgins: I don't know if I have that level of granularity, I know that that there just qualitatively fair amount of memory activity here in the June quarter that look at the data and then also some foundry shipments very strong quarter from Taiwan, you will see in some of the data in terms of bookings and I think that will turn quickly. So foundry pretty strong as well through June. I think for the year as I said earlier, I think if you look at total order mix and modeling that memory is probably in the low 40 percentile of the total. And I think our shipment profile would reflect that.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chen with UBS. Your line is open.
Stephen Chen: Thanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just another follow-up question on the gross margin. Does any of this foundry 28-nanometer fill-in spend that you talked about have a negative mix impact on KLA's gross margin now and maybe that reverses itself the second half of the year or is this 28-nanometer fill-in expense just not that meaningful?
Bren Higgins: Our margins across all of our segments are generally very consistent and segments and customers. So there isn’t really an impact if have one customer having versus another in the given quarter. Most of it’s driven - most of the variations frankly are in gross margins driven more around product mix than anything else right high end wafer inspection versus low or radical for example mash up versus fab, those dynamics tend to influence our gross margin much more so than anything related to customer mix or segment.
Stephen Chen: And just a brief follow-up question on the capital intensity. The foundry customers have talked about moving quickly from this 2X technology node to the 1X technology node. Should this be any benefit to KLA at this year or has that played itself out already? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: While we’ve certainly seen at least from some of the market leaders we’ve seen some investments this quarter and in last quarter very, very strong quarter in the December quarter and those tools are now beginning to ship. There is some other backlog that we expect that we book in previous quarter also we expect to ship as we move into second half of the year. So I think a lot of it’s going to be driven by end market demand that is dynamics among our customers and we want to see how that plays out.
Stephen Chen: Okay. Thanks Bren.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking the question. My first question would be are you planning to invest more into e-Beam inspection and into packaging related to tools?
Bren Higgins: I’m sorry E-beam and packaging that was the question?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes E-beam inspection and packaging.
Bren Higgins: Okay. So separate, yes. What we have - we certainly we have interest in trying to provide a complete defect inspection solution and so there are certainly there are niches of that which are best served by E-beam and we participate in certainly E-beam review we have a product, we are proud of there, we have not been in the inspection market but we are certainly evaluating ways down there. But we also believe that customers very much want high productivity solutions and the capability which are part of what our Fusion offering is aimed out as providing the capability of linking both optical inspection with the ability to quickly review those defects. So we’re participating, we don’t have I don’t see a huge increase in our E-beam inspection investment overall, we are investing pretty heavily in E-beam in general and we might move between some of the segments there. As far as packaging, we do have some ongoing opportunity, we frankly don’t see that big of a market for process control and packaging, we do participate in that but I would not anticipate increasing our investment toward packaging. I think the front end is much more interesting for us in terms of the opportunities that are out there.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And is there any particular product that could be more useful regarding automotive electronics, like micro-inspection that you might be invest in?
Bren Higgins: Well we have and we have had some success there again these are on a relative basis pretty small but we do have a product line that is a variance of some of our laser scanning product offerings that are used in the front end and this one is services the automotive and that is a product line called Altair where we have shared some success in automotive than we are seeing adoption across the number of customers. But again relatively small ASP and pretty hard to see in our overall numbers but we certainly participate there.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Co. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok: Hi, thanks for taking my question. First is a follow-up question on gross margin. It was down a few points early in the quarter. I know you guys guided for that already, but I was wondering what contribute to that? And I think previously you guys said you expect a year to fall within the range of 57%, 58% range? Is that how we should think about maybe a longer-term gross margin or nominal gross margin for your business?
Rick Wallace: Yes I think as I have to think about at these business levels, so 57% to 58% three-ish billion range is where I think we are going to end up. We had a very rich margin in the December quarter and very much an alignment with guidance for the March quarter. We think that we got some slight mix improvements as I look at June with very modest revenue increase. That's why we had to think about it and then over time I think you are to think dollar continue as I said in the prepared remarks to move it 60% to 70% incremental. One of the things we’re seeing as a service business grows it does put some pressure on margin but that’s contemplated in that incremental margin range. But we’ve have got that dynamic that goes on as well. So certainly in certain revenue levels, the impact of service margin can be higher than others. But that's how I have to think about it.
Edwin Mok: Okay, great, that's helpful. I guess a longer-term question on mask inspection, right? With the mask, the photomask industry is not consolidated already, and there is capacity out there, right? Do you see that market normalizing in the lower level and stabilize here? Especially with UV out there somewhere, is it possible that these company prefer not to invest in mask inspection or mask capacity in general?
Rick Wallace: Well I think that the challenge is the of multi-patterning actually put some interesting stresses on the mask because as we go below the 16 or 14-nanometer what we are seeing is increasingly complex mask which are driving a lot of requirements for our 6XX product line. The good news is, we don’t think that's a tremendously expensive investment required, it's off mostly algorithms and some modifications for the tool. So unlike going to new platform, we think that the investment required will be significant but not a significant if you had to do new platform. But as long as multi-patterning progresses, we do see stress on the mask and we think that's opportunity for the mask business and albeit at perhaps at a slightly lower revenue level but profitability should be good because we can continue to invest but at a lower rate than if we are doing a new platform. So we feel pretty good about that. We do have some tailwinds there because we can provide some capability for the EUV with that product line but that's already something that we've developed, there might be extensions to that. But we think there is good opportunity, I don’t think the mask business goes away at all, I think it probably has seen some of the tougher periods it’s going to go through and we think it probably stabilizes from here as we go forward.
Edwin Mok: Great, that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Shawn Lockman: Hi, good evening, this is Shawn Lockman on for Rubin. I was wanting to jump back to some comments you made in your prepared comments about scaling back investment in EUV as part of the workforce reduction. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your thinking there, and when you may reach a point again where that investment has to return, if that comes closer to 7 nanometer or prior to that and timelines around that.
Bren Higgins: Well we have for quite a while been very public that we are not going to continue to go forward on EUV reticle inspection without significant customer support because there is a limited set of customers. So while we will continue to do feasibility and some of the work there, we’re backing off some of the other work until we have that commitment from customers which isn't out there right now. So it's really not a question we can answer because it's an ongoing dialog with customers but I think there is only one of two answers that really make sense one is that, collectively the industry feels like we’re able to go ahead without actinic inspection for EUV and high production which I think is early to know that. And the way you go ahead is you leverage the 6XX platform and some other solutions to validate the reticles, that's one alternative. Another alternative is that there isn’t any high volume EUV production and we’re certainly as an industry a long way from knowing the answer to that and hopefully there will be in everyone's best interest. And then the last one is that the industry comes back and says that they are committed to actinic tool and we’ll work with them to develop it. But right now we’re backing off independent investment until we get that signal, we will continue to do IP work, we will continue do some work on source but we’re going to - we have been reducing that and that's part of this transition.
Shawn Lockman: Great, that extra color is helpful. I was wondering also if you could talk about any customer activity you are seeing in China right now? A lot of chatter around buildout there in terms of the industry. Just wondering if you could shed some light on any sort of activity you're seeing there and then also what you might expect for that market in the next two to three years?
Bren Higgins: Well in terms of current activity we did see some business out of China from one of our major customers there, its business that we have been tracking for some time and I think it’s been related to second source opportunities by some fabulous players. And so it’s encouraging to see that investment actually play out over the last quarter and in last couple of quarters. We’re not modeling any fundamental shift in over the longer run spend in China or growth beyond what we have normally seen and something consistent with the market at least at this point. I don’t know enough about what will happen, won't know what technology all those kinds of questions to put a – in a timeframe that makes any sense to put to try to quantify it in anyway. But we continue to see we had a very good quarter there, we continue to see business there for non-TSMC foundry.
Shawn Lockman: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. Your backlog actually has a pretty healthy level. I think it was about 1 to $1.1 billion a couple of years ago and now sitting around $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Can you talk a little bit about the composition of the backlog by end market and how confident are you that these products will be shipped, let's say, this year? And follow-on to that, are you seeing any cancellation that is more than normal? And can some of these tools in your backlog actually be used for next year rather than this year? Trying to gauge the health of the backlog in orders.
Bren Higgins: Yes. So the backlog, the majority of the backlog will ship over the next six months and just about all of it is planned to ship over the next six to nine months or so. So it is a little bit higher now. We've booked some business and there has been some delays on certain fab projects and so that has made the backlog go little bit bigger than what we saw let’s say a year ago. If we go back way ago, if you go back a few years you would see our backlog, shipment backlog is usually six to seven months. Right now it’s about five months, and so it is probably bigger than it was in the last year where it was four to five. So we expect that as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect that to ship, I don’t have the details on the composition, but the composition ever reflects the composition of our orders. The tools are in backlog for anywhere from three to five months and then they ship out in revenue within about six months or so from the time we take the order overall. So I think that it matches the order percentages that we give every quarter.
Sidney Ho: Okay. As a follow-up, I know this -- the CapEx got by two of your major customers have been asked a few times and I think the reuse of tools are pretty well understood at this current generation. But they also both talk about better capital efficiencies, just better use and whatnot. I think this is unique for the first generation of FinFET, but does that change if you were to -- this WFE will eventually reach what everyone has been thinking, like $37 billion at some point?
Bren Higgins: I'm probably not the best guy to ask about when the industry is at 37 or we see run up to there I mean the way we model is the capital intensity is probably not declining much anymore, its probably flat, its probably not increasing. And so the underlying semiconductor revenue growth rate of 4% to 5% which means CapEx and wafer fab equipment on a growth generally inline with that over time. And so as we run our business, we see similar growth rates on the system side, our service business is growing faster than that and that's how we think about modeling the company. Where the peak is, is always hard to say, usually peaks are followed by troughs but in terms of through cycle view that's how we think about it.
Sidney Ho: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Thank you very much. So I had a question on the restructuring. I know it's early and you are still working through it. Can you give a sense of where is the majority of the cut will be, in sales or G&A or R&D or is it more even?
Rick Wallace: Yes. We are not really in a position to quantify that now. As Bren said, and we said in our prepared remarks over the next several weeks as we work through those details, we are going to make that public as soon as we finalize those. But we are not ready at this time to disclose that.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay. Then one quick question on the actinic inspection. I think you made some reference to cut mask. If you reuse just for cut mask, do you think it's much easier to do the cut mask without actinic inspection as opposed to the other steps?
Bren Higgins: I think that there are options, if it's cut mask and development that leverage the existing infrastructure. If it's only a couple of layers which is the way we’re understanding it now. And I think using the 6XX to support that work for development. High volumes are different question but for development I think we are certainly in a position to be able to help customers do that. And yes, the technical challenge is associated with the cut mask are going to be easier.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thank you so much.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay operator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for all joining and we look forward to seeing you later on in the quarter.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Candice, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Ed Lockwood, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood : Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We’re here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven’t seen the release, you can find it on our Web site at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408- 875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. This quarter we prepared a brief slide presentation to supplement this earnings call, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the EPS guidance and other supplemental financial information. These slides can be found on KLA-Tencor’s Investor Relations Web site. There, you’ll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2014, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you’ll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time, including our fiscal year 2014 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today’s call. KLA-Tencor posted solid results that met or exceeded our expectation for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Our financial performance in Q2 was highlighted by gross margin and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance. Reflecting KLA-Tencor’s strong competitive positioning in the most critical process control markets as well as a heightened focus on cost discipline across our worldwide operations. New orders were also strong in Q2, finishing above the midpoint of the range of guidance at $865 million and up 53% compared to Q1. The recent end market demands trend continued in the second quarter with new orders from leading edge foundry and logic for sub 20-nanometer production comprising the majority of system bookings in December, followed by 20-nanometer capacity conversions in DRAM. As we look ahead to calendar 2015, with leading edge device demand expected to be strong and customer profitability expected to remain at high level, we are planning for another year of growth for the industry and for process control, with semiconductor WFE investment forecasted to grow in a range of 5% to 10% in the year. In this environment of sustaining strong investment in the leading edge, the demand outlook for process control and KLA-Tencor’s prospects also remain very favorable. In the near term however, demand remains fluid, particularly in foundry and logic, where we have recently seen orders from select customers slated for sub 20-nanometer, originally expected in the March quarter, pushed to later in the calendar year. We believe these delayed orders reflect yield and process stability issues associated with bringing these advanced device architectures to market. Demand from memory customers remains robust, and in fact we achieved our highest quarterly bookings level for memory in Q2. Memory demand is expected to remain strong in calendar 2015 with 20-nanometer conversions in DRAM making up the majority of memory customer activity. NAND projects in calendar 2015 are expected to be largely focused on plainer architectures with expanded investment in 3D planned for later in the year. As always demand growth in our business is driven by the strong pace of investment in next generation semiconductor device technologies by the market leaders in logic, foundry and memory. Process control plays a critical role in helping these customers solve the mission critical production problems associated with managing yields and leading edge manufacturing environment. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor continues to benefit from these ever more complex and costly yield challenges. So from our perspective 2015 promises to be an exciting year for KLA-Tencor. Looking beyond these near term market factors, we’re well positioned in key markets with innovative products to execute our strategies for growth and market leadership and to deliver strong returns to our stockholders. Turning now to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, new orders in March are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $700 million. Our current forecast shows orders in the first half of calendar 2015 on par with levels achieved in the second half of calendar 2014. Revenue guidance for Q3 is in the range of $685 million to $765 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.87 per share for the quarter. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Bren, for his commentary on the quarter before returning for Q&A. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick and good afternoon. Revenue for Q2 was in the upper half of the range of guidance at $676 million and non-GAAP earnings per share finished above the guided range for the quarter at $0.68, driven by stronger than expected gross margins in the quarter and good execution of cost management, fully diluted GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.12. The GAAP earnings per share in Q2 included $0.53 of charges related to the leveraged recapitalization transaction, which we completed in Q2 and $0.03 of restructuring and acquisition related charges, net of the income tax effect on these adjustments. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude these adjustments. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings per share can be found in the press release and supplemental materials posted on our Website prior to this earnings call. New orders in Q2 were $865 million above the midpoint of guidance of $700 million to $900 million for the quarter. We continue to experience a high degree of variability in order timing and delivery day commitments from our customers. We believe this is the new normal for our industry, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 75% of demand today and often with one or two customers accounting for a significant portion of order and shipment volume in a given quarter. With each customer having their unique timeline for executing their technology, investment and capacity expansion plans and with shorter product delivery lead times becoming normal in our industry, forecasting accuracy of bookings within a 12 week window has clearly become even more of a challenge.  With that, though December orders and shipments were strong, the near term shift in customer demand requirements that Rick mentioned have resulted in certain shipments which were originally slated for the March and June quarters moving into the second half of calendar 2015. We see this is largely a timing issue and our optimism for calendar 2015 to be a growth year for KLA-Tencor is high. Our internal shipments forecast for calendar 2015 is consistent with business levels that would support revenue growth for KLA-Tencor, in line with the overall industry growth rates and what is expected to be another year of strong CapEx investment, with shipment volumes roughly balanced across the first and second half for the year.  Regarding customer segment commentary for the second quarter, combined foundry and logic customer demand was 56% of new orders in Q2, and slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to some marginal weakness at the leading edge. As I mentioned, we believe the near term volatility in foundry and logic is largely a timing issue and a function of a variety of factors including customer concentration and yield issues as well as shifting capacity requirements at the leading edge for 14 and 16 nanometer and the timing of early development activity for 10 nanometer. Memory bookings were a record in Q2, finishing at 44% of new system orders in a period with upside from DRAM.  We expect memory demand as a percent of total system orders in calendar year 2015 to be on par with our calendar 2014 result, with investment focused on technology upgrades in DRAM and our capacity additions of plainer device architectures in NAND and 3D NAND. Investment by our customers at 20 nanometer and below constituted roughly 69% of the orders we received in the December quarter. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 47%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was approximately 20%, service was 20%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q2 were $766 million, up 40% sequentially from September. We expect shipping growth again in Q3 to a midpoint of approximately $785 million in the quarter. Given current shipment backlog, we expect shipment levels to remaining at a high level with first year calendar 2015 shipments expected to grow compared with the second half of 2014. In total we ended the year with just over 1.3 billion of total backlog, comprised of 1.1 billion of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Total backlog includes $262 million of revenue backlog of products that have been shipment and invoiced, but have not yet have been accepted by customers. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $676 million above the midpoint of the guided range and up 5% compared with Q1. Gross margin was 58.5%, an increase of nearly 3% from September and significantly above the guided range for the quarter. Our gross margin significantly exceeded guidance for the quarter due to a favorable mix of products and services and better than expected manufacturing efficiencies due to output levels and favorable foreign exchange impact in our off shore factories. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56.5% and 57.5% in the March quarter as the benefit of higher revenue volume is offset by a less favorable product mix compared to the December quarter. The shipment dynamics related to today's operating environment have also added additional volatility to our gross margins. Over time our gross margin performance should continue to reflect our differentiated business model, which is fueled by 50% to 70% incremental gross margins. Operating expenses were $231 million, down from $240 million in Q1 and below the guided range of $236 million to $238 million for the quarter, as we saw the benefit of a heightened focus on cost management. Over the past few years we have made critical investments in R&D and customer application support, advancing the product roadmap for flagship products such as Broadband Plasma and latest scattering wafer inspection technologies and the Archer platform in overlay metrology. We’ve also made investments in new opportunities for growth, such as the 5D patterning control solution. We believe there are additional opportunities to continue to meet customer requirements and sustain our market leadership, while driving better cost efficiencies throughout our organization. Looking ahead, we are modeling operating expenses of approximately $227 million to $229 million in the March quarter and expect operating expense level to decline over the course of the calendar year to about $220 million per quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $29 million, reflecting the impact of the debt on the balance sheet resulting from our leverage tree capitalization. We expect OAE to be a net expense in March of approximately $30 million. The tax rate was 16.4% in Q2, lower than the 23% revised guidance rate for the December quarter, principally driven by the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in the U.S. Going forward, you should continue to use a long term planning rate of 22% for modeling purposes. At the 22% guided tax rate, earnings per share would have been $0.64 in Q2. Net income was $113 million or $0.68 per fully diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, a decrease of 576 million compared with September. This reflects the impact of the leverage recapitalization transaction we completed in the December quarter. In conjunction with this transaction, we issued an aggregate amount of 2.5 billion of senior notes with various maturities with a blended interest rate of 4.28%. We also entered into a $1.25 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facility. This credit facility consists of $750 million of amortizing term loans and commitments for an unfunded revolving credit facility of $500 million. The interest rate on the $750 million credit facility is 1.49% based on current rates. With proceeds from the leverage recapitalization, we paid a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share for a total amount of $2.76 billion. Concurrent with our leverage recapitalization, we also announced that the Board of Directors has authorized an expansion of our existing $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced in July by an additional $250 million. In quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $69.94. As of December 31, we had approximately 14.8 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We plan to execute these share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition to the $16.50 special cash dividend in December, we paid a regular dividend of $82 million or $0.50 per share in the quarter. Cash from operations was $11 million in the quarter, down $24 million sequentially, largely due to the higher account receivable associated with the ramp in shipments in the quarter and monthly shipment linearity. And lastly, fully diluted shares ended the quarter at $167 million. In conclusion to reiterate, our guidance for the March quarter is, new orders are expected to be in the range of $500 million to $700 million, revenue is expected in the range of $685 million to $765 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.63 to $0.87 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I’ll turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you, Bren. At this point, we’d like to open the call to questions. We once again request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up given the limited time we have for today’s call. Please feel free to re-queue for you follow-up questions and we’ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. Candice.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Bren, your commentary on the first calendar half of the year, did I hear that right in that it suggests that the June orders are going to be up like 35% - 40% sequentially and I guess does that assume that the push outs on FinFET, that they come in June or is that they’re more additive to that during the back half of the year? Then I had a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: So Tim, it’s a good question. So when we looked at it, we saw a similar profile to the second half of calendar '14 with the weaker first quarter with some bounce back into the June quarter. So it looks -- as we size the six month period, it looks pretty similar to us. And as I said in the prepared remarks, I think that the 12 week widow dynamic is becoming a more challenging dynamic for us to forecast with the customer concentration we have and size of orders and so on. So as we look at the six month window, it looks like it’s roughly the same size.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay thanks. And then just on margin, Bren. At this revenue level, margins are a very good 150 basis points below. I'm just looking at the March guidance. They’re good 150 basis points below where -- if you kind of average out where they've been over last couple of years at that particular revenue level, it seems like you’re giving up about 150 basis points on margins. What exactly is happening there with the mix and will you get that back in June?
Bren Higgins: Well, the mix factors are -- for the same reasons we talked about with the shipment plans, as you ship tools to customers and you’re shipping more to individual customers, you’re revenuing tools faster. So in some ways, your margin is impacted by the mix of products your shipping to a greater degree than what we’ve seen in the past. Clearly margins were extremely strong in Q2 for the reasons we talked about and there is some correction of that in the March quarter. I think if you’re modeling out our business at this $3 billion run rate, I expect to see gross margins somewhere between 57% and 58%. There are obviously the mixed dynamics that will play out in any given quarter, but that’s how we’re modeling it today.
Rick Wallace: And I think the other thing to keep in mind is the growth of our -- Tim, I think one other thing to keep in mind is the growth of our service business, while accretive at the operating margin level is dilutive to our gross margins. The way we do our accounting, there is no operating expenses there. So we believe it’s -- there is an impact, dilutive impact to gross margins from that dynamic in services in the low 20 percentile of our revenue mix.
Operator: And your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Farhan Ahmad: Can you briefly talk about, like the push outs that you saw, are they coming more from the leading edge sub-20 nanometer production as you mentioned? Is it coming from primarily in U.S. region or is it coming from overseas, some foundries? Can you just briefly describe which region did you see the push outs from?
Rick Wallace: Well, we came in obviously stronger versus the midpoint in Q2. So certainly that impacted our views on Q3 with some pull ins in the Q2. But in terms of Q3 versus what we thought, it’s really a mixed bag across foundry and logics. So its leading edge, but also some of the trailing edge business that we’ve been forecasting for some time and has been a bit allusive and I think that’s dependent ultimately on some competitive dynamics in terms of second source strategies and so on. So I would say it’s across the Board in terms of what we saw in Q3, and as I said earlier some of it we think comes back in Q4. 
Farhan Ahmad: And then, second question I have is just talking about your next six month forecast, you're talking of revenues being flattish, half and half. If I look at the EBITDA level that you had in second half of calendar year, it's about $313 million. Assuming that your profitability and revenues are similar, you're looking at like EBITDA levels of about 600 -- $26 million and $30 million, do you think that there is some risk to the debt-to-EBITDA covenants as we look for a year or two? Your EBITDA profile seems pretty low compared to what it was a year ago, in terms of like -- if I look at the six months period from now and the past six months, and compared that to the previous one year, it's down quite a bit? 
Bren Higgins: So our commentary on the first half was bookings related, not revenue. So I expect the revenue to be higher than bookings. I won't guide June obviously but I don't we will see sequential growth into the June quarter. So I don't have the math in front of me on EBITDA, but as I've looked at it relative to the covenants I have with bank debt is that we feel pretty comfortable with the level we have relative to what our expectations are for the business going forward. So I don't have any concerns based on what we see today. Obviously with the backlog position we have and our expectations for shipments into this quarter, June should set us for a sequential increase and improving operating profitability. 
Operator: And your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. 
Krish Sankar: Two of them. First one, Rick or Bren, it looks like you're running at a $600 million run rate for bookings in March and $800 million or so in June. What do the composition of those orders look like in March and June in terms of memory and foundry? And I had a follow-up. 
Rick Wallace: Yes, so we're not guiding the June quarter but for March. March looks to be pretty foundry centric, so 70% foundry. And memory is 19%, logic 11%. And NAND as a percent of the total memory mix is up 31%. 
Krish Sankar: Okay. That's helpful. And then a second question is one of things I noticed, both December, March and your guidance on OpEx is that, the OpEx seems to be coming up pretty strongly. It seems like -- just trying to find out, is this a function of you guys responding much faster, more aggressive on the OpEx side given gross margin or pricing might be under pressure or is it a function of the fact that there are some projects that don't need to be executed any more, like 450 or something else like that? 
Bren Higgins: Krish, you said coming up? Did you mean OpEx is coming down? 
Krish Sankar: OpEx is coming down, yes. 
Bren Higgins: Yeah. 
Krish Sankar: Okay 
Rick Wallace: So, Krish I think that's right. If you look at the last couple of years, we have had sustained investment in a number of key platforms in the program. Obviously we're investing in 450, investing at a slight level but investing EUV in addition to some growth opportunities like our 5D solution. Customer support, another area. And so we've invested according to the road map. We think we're in a position now relative to our road maps and our competitive position that we think that there are opportunities for us to start to scale this down somewhat. And so saw that momentum play out in the December quarter. We think it continues in March and progresses through the year. So we're also doing some things underneath the surface in terms of how we think about our sustaining engineering, how do we use offshore engineering resources more efficiently and so on, that we think we can drive the operating run rate down to the 220 range as we move through the calendar year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. 
C.J. Muse: I was hoping to go back to your comments on your customer concentration, because if we go back in time, you guys had great ability to manage through a six month backlog give or take, and clearly there was customer concentration issues then as well. And so just curious, is it movement of market share from one player to another? Is it enhanced customer concentration? What's driving the change in your business model? 
Rick Wallace: Well I think it's really our customers. Given the lead times that they have in the markets that they are supporting, I think their lead times have come in and I think we've seen that same pressure pushed back on us. So we have -- we had to change our business somewhat in terms of our ability to be flexible and respond. But in a lot of these cases, we will have these conversations where we'll ask for more lead time and our customers will push back, given the dynamics that they are facing.  So there is less predictability. We've seen it for a while and I think it just changed versus where we were in the past. I think it's more the end markets and I think the concentration we have, very sizable orders, sizable shipments that are going to ship out, and as the customer changes the plan, that has a dramatic impact obviously on a given quarter's shipment. So our shipments tend to be pretty close to the ranges that we're guiding, but it's more of a challenge today and certainly impacts not just the overall shipment level, which has an impact on revenue but also the gross margin, given the mix of products that you're shipping. 
Bren Higgins: I also think if you think about consolidation, one way I would think about it is, I look at consolidation of our customer's customer in terms of their influence on the spend. So especially in the foundry space, their actions actually are often not really clear until very late to our foundry customers and that’s part of the dynamic of the movement. That’s why we don’t get more visibility I think from our foundry customers.
C.J. Muse: That’s helpful, and I guess as a follow up – Tier 1 was, how should we think about the uplift in your account receivables? And then the second one is, you’ve shown really good growth on the service side. Will that continue, and how should we think about I guess service spares, as well as upgrades as part of that mix?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I’ll take the service side. I do think we’ll continue to see growth out of service. One of the things service is benefiting from on the, one way I think about it, the Internet of Things isn’t really driving a lot of front end WFE spend, but it is driving the longevity of a lot of these fabs which is good for our service business. And so I think part of what’s happening is that some of these fabs run longer and get more devices, we're the extension of the life of the tools that are being serviced and that’s part of the underlying driver for our service business, which is great, and I'll let Bren handle the accounting part.
Bren Higgins: So the day sales outstanding was, on revenue about 85 days. So significant uptick there. And that was really a function of the monthly shipment linearity. We shipped a number of tools in December and in the last part of December or so. The cash collection will happen in the first quarter on those shipments and so I’m expecting reversion back to normal 70ish or so DSO levels, plus or minus a few days, and it will drive operating cash flow probably up in the $250 million to $300 million range as we move into March, based on what we’re expecting to ship today and the timing of those shipments so.
Operator: And your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Bill Peterson: Yes hi, good afternoon this is Bill Peterson calling for Harlan. I was hoping you can I guess share a little more color on this push out. Is it basically just one customer or is it broader participation? And I guess what gives you the confidence that these will materialize for the second half of the calendar year? What do you base the confidence on?
Rick Wallace: Well, if you look back, even some of the stuff that we pushed out, even within December and we were having very high level of conversations with customers that felt like they had pretty strong commitments from their customers to move forward and they were in process of allocating space and slots to support their ramp, and then very late in the day that got pushed and so some of those things even pushed outside of the March -- and into the second half. So when we look at the overall dynamics you say that we’re in great shape share wise. The adoption seems to be working. What happens is these guys slide as the dynamics behind them are moving. And we see that both as Bren mentioned to the prior question, both at the leading edge and as we’re seeing some of that in logic, but also some of the not leading edge, in the foundry space we’re seeing movement. So just go back to what are your assumptions about WFE for the year and what do you really think of foundry spend, and our view is, if in fact the WFE numbers work out, then we’ll see them in the second half; but until -- as you know, until the orders are placed, it’s very hard to know if they will. But if you go back to -- our underwriting assumption is WFE up 5% to 10% this year and the mix largely intact with what it was last year, we feel pretty good about how the year is going to play out. It’s just the uncertainty has increased the volatility due to concentration.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Jim, thanks for taking the question. Can you talk about your plans for paying down or refinancing the new debt, and whether or not 2 to 2.5 times is the leverage level to be thinking about?
Rick Wallace: So, we just borrowed the money. So we're not planning to refinance. We're pretty happy with the structure of the debt that I laid out in the prepared remarks. Our goal -- our long term target is 2 to 2.5 times. We think that makes sense for a business with our characteristics. We went above that in this case as I talked about in the last call, given the attractive lending environment, but also what we expect to be a healthy CapEx environment over the next couple of years. We structured the debt in a way that we can pay it down and we’ll pay it down with -- the term loan piece, which is pre-payable with a lot of flexibility and how we do that. And so we’ll do that over the next couple of years, working down to our long term target. So that’s how we’re thinking about it.
Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And as a follow up, you mentioned in the last call that you’re expecting multiple players to be on FinFET by the end of 2015. Have you, are you still expecting multiple players, or is that more of a one player?
Rick Wallace: In the foundry?
Unidentified Analyst : Yes, in foundry.
Rick Wallace: So, I think you’ll see multiple players. I think that’s still our expectation, but to the point earlier, we’re seeing a much more measured ramp up capacity for FinFET. I think the leader is comfortable with their position and the other players are working quickly to try to catch up, and I think the competitive dynamics on that front will ultimately drive how much capacity gets added over the course of the year. We think that is what’s driving some of it into the second half, but ultimately I think you end up with multiple players with the capability.
Operator: And your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Your line is now open.
Edwin Mok: First one, did I heard correctly that you said you expect your shipment in the memory space to be roughly the same this year or flat to the last calendar year? And if that’s the case, that would imply a very strong growth in foundry potentially in the second half. Is that how we should think about kind of shipment trajectory for your business?
Rick Wallace: Well we said orders. The order mix as a percent of the total, we expect it to be roughly similar, in the low 30 percentile. That was memory in calendar ‘15 versus calendar ‘14. There could be some timing issues, but generally that should translate mostly to shipments in a similar mix, but obviously the timing issues and the lead time can have an effect on that. For us from a pricing perspective, product mix perspective and so on, there’s not a lot of difference in terms of what we ship in memory and foundry. So it doesn’t really have an impact necessarily on the revenue levels or the margin profile of the various segments. So it’s all pretty consistent across the segments for us.
Edwin Mok: And then on this foundry push out, maybe just some clarification there. So you mentioned there is some push out, not just in leading edge but also trench [ph] orders right? But then you also mentioned that as your quarter came in a little stronger than expected and there was some [indiscernible] on order. I’m just trying to understand the dynamics, are these pushed out? Are you expecting a lot of these push out to be captured in the June quarter, which is you guide for higher order in June quarter, but some of that expect through the second half? In terms of shipment of these order given the push out, should we expect the shipment to come back in the second half, or is it more potentially delayed to ‘16?
Rick Wallace: Well, we had a nice bounce back in foundry from Taiwan specifically in the December quarter. So that was encouraging to see, but foundry was weaker than we expected going into the quarter. Most of the strength came from a much stronger memory and mix of business than we were remodeling. As we look at the next quarter or so, a couple of quarters, as we said earlier, it’s a mixed bag. Its 20-nanometer and below. It’s also some 28-nanometer business. And obviously there’s also some 10-nanometer early activity that’s part of that as well. So it’s a collection of customers, and not huge amounts of dollars, but in the aggregate obviously had an impact on what we were planning for in the first half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho: Maybe a big picture question for Rick in terms of memory process control intensity. If I recall, at your Analyst Day last July, you mentioned that you expect to see process control intensity rise for the memory space. Looking at the DRAM spending that we're seeing today and the conversion to 20-nanometers, one, are you seeing this? And secondly is there a bias towards inspection or metrology, particularly as you see more multiple patterning steps at 20-nanometers?
Rick Wallace: Pretty much tracking the way we laid it out at SEMICON, in terms of memory. The one caveat I would say, for DRAM it is and back to the mix, it looks like historical mix. You do get overlay. To your point you get some strength there. But you also have advanced defect [ph] inspection to find some of these smaller nodes as you’re pushing DRAM technology. So DRAM looks very much like we said. And as we said then, and even said in the last call, it’s too early to tell on 3D Flash because there just hasn’t been enough of it and its still early days on that. So whether or not that plays out to be at the intensity that we laid out, time will tell. And given the latest -- the view that there is going to be more push out of 3D from what was expected even at SEMICON, I think that it will be the best of the calendar year for we'll really have validated that model. But I think for DRAM it has been tracking the way we assumed in this -- the historical mix looks pretty similar between metrology and inspection.
Patrick Ho: And as my follow up question, maybe also for your Rick. In terms of the foundry process control intensity, you guys saw a big pick up when 28-nanometers was rolling out, given the yield challenges. I guess the two part question there is, one, how come you haven’t seen it yet with the 16 and 14 given the challenges there? And secondly do you think you’ll get that kind of incremental step up that you saw at 28?
Rick Wallace: Yes. I think that the challenges associated with the yield right now, we’re seeing sub-20 are not necessarily things that inspection and measurement can address. I think it’s more a function of some of the just process integration. And while we could be helpful in diagnosing that, that’s very different than addressing the manufacturing RAM. So we’re still early days on that. Will we see it again? We’re too early to say whether that will be validated in the rollout, because people aren’t really far enough along in that development to know. But our expectations are that the signs are good. There are also some questions about utilization of existing facilities. For example will customers roll what is 20-nanometer capability to 16 and then what happens to the intensity in that scenario? And again, it’s too early to know that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Rick, it seems like you a pretty good confidence with opportunities this year. It's just that the quarterly booking and shipments are lumpy, something that we went through last year. So given your confidence and also the lumpiness, why not provide us with kind of the year end guide so that we could avoid debating whether June will be up 30% or flat, and put the focus on your longer term opportunities, rather than trying to time the specific orders that have such a big variance, given the customer concentration.
Bren Higgins: So maybe I’ll go ahead and start. So we try to provide a little bit more color in broader windows, six month window about we’re seeing in the business over the last few quarters. And I think that’s important. We’ve also tried to give you some insight into where we are, based on where the industry is projecting to be where, we think we’ll end up relative to that. So for example, when we talk about calendar ’15, I think in Rick’s prepared remarks we thought given the dynamics of the mix of business across foundry and logic versus memory, that we would expect if the industry was up 5% to 10%, we ought to perform somewhere in line with market. We think that obviously the process control intensities of the two segments or three segments are different, with memory as a higher percentage. That does impact our ability to outperform the industry. So as we look at it this year with roughly the same mix of business, we see a market perform year and I think that translates from a 12 month perspective into a $3 billion to $3.1 billion type performance level at the $33 billion and $34 billion WFE level, which is that plus 5 to plus 10 range. So we’re trying to do it, all but at the same time, we feel like we don’t to be less transparent in the process. We think the quarterly bookings are less relevant to our business today, given concentration and given that the industry is not as difficult as it was in the past. But it is something that we’ve always provided and we’ll continue to provide it. We've put a broader range on it and we’ll do the best we can and then try to bridge it back to what happened versus what we thought would happen.
Rick Wallace: And Mehdi, to your point, I know you’ve made this point before. I don’t disagree with the thought process in terms of the lumpiness and how much help is it really. But on the other hand, as Bren said, we’re reluctant to remove something, given the general view of the desire to have transparency. But it is something we debate from time to time. I could tell you it’s not exactly how we run the business. When we go back and think about how do we run the business, how do we size the business and how do we make investments, it’s not based on the quarterly numbers. It’s based on what we view as trends, and even then, it's not even annualized. It's on a longer term basis than that. But your point is once again made.
Mehdi Hosseini: That’s fair. And then my follow has to do with EUV. When you presented at a competitor conference in December, you highlighted some of the intimate conversation you’re having with some of your customer. The big foundry in Taiwan is proceeding forward. What are you going to come down to? It seems like you’re waiting for investment, the largest customer is proceeding forward. Is there a timeline here or are you just not going to proceed forward, even if your largest customer wants to move forward?
Rick Wallace: Well, I think that the way it stands today, that any production done with EUV before 2020 is going to be done without at [indiscernible] wafer, a reticle inspection. We are now too late to make any insertion point. And that’s based on the fact that there is still a lot of debate by our customers about the relative tradeoff between the cost of us developing that technology and their confidence its need in production. So I'm not saying EUV won’t go into production before 2020, because we don’t know that. But I can tell you it won’t go in production before 2020 with [indiscernible] reticle inspection. So either it won’t go in production or they'll have to figure out how to deal without it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mahesh Sanganeria: I just want to get one more clarification on the foundry push out. ASML reported a pretty good booking, and I think that primarily came from Taiwan, and I think you commented that your booking had a pretty good Taiwan component. So my guess is that the push out you were seeing is not from Taiwan and other places?
Bren Higgins: Well, as I said earlier, I think it’s a mix group and it comes from a number of regions and in a number of nodes. So I think given lead time, I think certainly customers tend to get into the queue with litho sooner. I don’t know exactly what ASML set or they positioned it. But as we look at it today, and into Rick’s point earlier there is some fluidity to these orders, certainly at 28 nanometer and so they’re moving around a little bit and so the timing is uncertain. And we're set to see how it plays out.
Mahesh Sanganeria: So can you comment on what could be the driver -- we know that was 2016 the driver is that the yield issues and customer giving allocation to different foundries, that’s a big driver for 16-20 nanometer fluidity. What in your opinion is driving the changes at mature technologies?
Rick Wallace: I think it's a similar dynamic. It’s just not happening so much with the leading edge foundries. I think there is significant competition for 28-nanometer foundry capacity, and we are seeing movement among those players as they try to win that business. So similar thing but just not with these exact same players.
Operator: And your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.
Weston Twigg: Just wondering real quick on the reticle inspection business, which I know is a good high margin business, but you've mentioned it’s somewhat saturated. I was wondering if there is any opportunity for that to pick up a bit more as customers move to multi-patterning schemes, or do you think the installed base is generally pretty sufficient at this point?
Rick Wallace: It’s a great question, Weston. I think that the -- we don’t know the answer yet. I think that it’s not as much about multi-patterning per se as it is sub 20-nanometer technology. So the multi-patterning above 20 I think is pretty well positioned. The question will be sub-20, are there new kind of inspection modes that require new algorithms new developments as people try to figure out exactly how to tune those reticles to support sub-20. And there are some indications that will create some boost in demand. But again, it’s relatively early in that and we don’t really see it. So what mostly is happening now, we did have some good reticle business last quarter, but mostly what happening is in the fab and those tools are not fully -- those are not as complete tools. So you have a tool that’s targeted at fab line that’s a different kind of tool than what we sell in our shop. But we’ll wait and see on that. I think that there is a good possibility that we’ll see some increase in demand. I wouldn’t forecast that in the very near term, no. I think that’s a longer term thing.
Weston Twigg: Okay that’s helpful and then just really quickly, wondering with the new cash balance, can you give us just an update on what’s offshore versus onshore?
Bren Higgins: It’s -- about 1 billion [ph] of it is onshore.
Rick Wallace: $2.4 billion onshore 
Operator: Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.
Romit Shah: Rick, ASML said the other day that every single memory maker is increasing capacity. And I know you indicated that visibility in 3D NAND as a bit limited today, but I was wondering on DRAM, how do you see capacity playing out here in the first half? Is it increasing? And how would you describe the pace?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I think memory is setting up to have a good year again in 2015. We have seen strength in our memory business as we commented on the call. The December quarter was our best memory quarter and we see that continuing, and it is mostly in DRAM and we think for the year it looks that way with the 3D NAND being later in the year. So I think it’s true and I think our adoption has improved, but again it’s at the lower level that foundry. So from our standpoint, a mix shift toward memory doesn’t increase our available market.
Romit Shah: And Bren just on the special dividend, I think it was a little controversial at the time, but in retrospect it looks it was a very good decision, and I'm curious how you’re thinking about this going forward? Have you considered at all the idea of doing a smaller, but perhaps more frequent special dividend based on the performance of the business?
Bren Higgins: So I'll back up and our process is that as we evaluate the Company’s strategic plan and we look at not only our cash reserves but the debt capacity that we have, we go through that process and we think about the alternatives of how we invest operationally, M&A considerations or shareholders return consideration. So that’s a regular process for us. Clearly the shareholder return options are viable options, and I think in terms of value creation, the other options are juxtaposed against that. So clearly we have a long-term target, and in terms of leverage levels we think that makes sense, and as we de-lever the debt and we see the growth in EBITDA and our business we’ll -- to the extent that that affords a position for us to run through that process and consider it again, it’s a possibility but we'll run through the process and make the right call, based on what we think is in the best interest of the shareholders long term.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sundeep Bajikar with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Sundeep Bajikar: Two questions on foundry. First, what level of sub 20-nanometer foundry capacity do you currently expect to see get built or converted overall? And how much of this did you actually see get built in the December quarter, if at all?
Rick Wallace: So we just -- I think some of the 20-nanometer conversion will be largely determined by what happens with the end markets and whether -- the major customer there, as they migrate away from 20 does that capacity get consumed by other fabless customers. So I think that's the wildcard. I think that the 14, 16 capacity is really just starting to get at it. And so we'll see that capacity get at it over the next few quarters or so through this calendar year, with FinFET designs coming out of the foundries probably sometime in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. At least that's our best estimate at this point. 
Sundeep Bajikar: Okay. And just as a follow-up. What's typically the lead time in foundry? I know you said you don't have a lot of visibility, but if you can provide a perspective on how much the lead time might have shrunk, I think that would be helpful? 
Rick Wallace: It varies by customer across products, but I think we're -- generally if you look at our backlog with most customers we're usually -- it's about four months from the time that we get orders to the time we ship the tool. So it varies, but I think that's a reasonable way to think about it.
Operator: And your next question comes from Sydney [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. 
Unidentified Analyst: I just want to make sure that I hear that in your prepared remarks you mentioned the WFE market is going to grow 5% to 10%, but you expect your mix to be similar to 2014. I don't know if it's orders or revenue. But at the same time you also expect to grow in line with the WFE market. If I look back at 2014, I think the mix was -- if the mix is the same but you actually under grow the market in 2014, as well as '13, and I believe that one of the major reasons is because of mix. Can you help me reconcile how you're going to be able to grow in line with the WFE market? Is there some customer specific -- is there some intensity increase, that kind of thing?
Rick Wallace: Well think of it this way. If the mix stays the same year-on-year, then we shouldn't see under the market grows less than the overall market, right? What happened in '14 is the mix swung to memory. That make sense?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. 
Rick Wallace: So therefore it drove down the overall potential market for process control, because memory intensity is lower. If year-on-year the mix is the same as last year, then our compare is last year and then we ought to be able to grow with the market for this space. Does that makes sense? 
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, I guess the point is the mix didn't turn more unfavorable. 
Rick Wallace: Well it stays where it was. So as opposed to shifting. What happened in '14 versus '13 is it increased for memory, and that drove down available market for process control, right.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay 
Rick Wallace: If '15 ends up looking like '14, then that's your compare. And of course we hope to outgrow it, but when we're looking across the board. Now if memory is actually a larger percent, if that makes increases, then we'll be up against that headwind and we'll have to grow either through market share or driving additional adoption.
Unidentified Analyst: That makes sense. My follow-up question is on foundry. I think there are many questions on foundries, but it seems like there should be a big push for foundries in the first half and I know you talk about some push outs and what not. Is there enough visibility right now to look at what you think you're first half versus second half is? 
Rick Wallace: Well I think overall we can do the whole year and we look out and that goes back to WFE for the year. And as things slash around, and they are -- to Bren's point it can impact it, because late enough in the year our ability that revenue -- because of the shipments and revenue. But the dynamic right now is shaping up. We still think the year looks consistent with a up 5 to 10, but with some moving parts and we're not certain how they're going to play out. But we don't give guidance beyond the next quarter other than commentary on our perspective on the year. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Mr. Lockwood for closing remarks. 
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Candice. That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to seeing you later on in this quarter.
Operator: And this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I’ll now turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We’re here today to discuss first quarter results for the period ended December 30, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific time. If you haven’t seen the release, you can find it on our Web site at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.

We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Wallace:  Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in our earnings call. Today, I’ll discuss our refinancing and recapitalization announcement and the business highlights of the first quarter. Bren will then review the financial details of today’s announcements followed by Q&A. Today, as part of our ongoing activities focused on returning value to shareholders, KLA-Tencor is announcing our intention to recapitalize our balance sheet. These actions reflect management and the Board of Directors’ confidence in our market leadership, business model and long-term growth strategies, as well as our leadership and strong commitment to delivering a high level of returns to stockholders. Bren will have more details of the transaction, but in summary, what we’re announcing today is proposed leverage recapitalization of KLA-Tencor, which would return approximately $4 billion to our stockholders. Subject to closing of the financial aspect of this initiative, we intend to issue a $16.50 per share special dividend. We’re also announcing that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase to the company’s stock repurchase program by an additional 3.0 million shares of common stock. This increasing value add approximately $250 million based upon the closing cost of our common stock as of October 20, 2014. We believe our capital structure strategy underscores our confidence and the strength of our strategic objectives in our business model, but also the strength of our balance sheet. As we’ve invested in our business and executed our growth strategies over time, we have experienced strong cash generation in excess of what believe is necessary to fund our operations and investing our future growth. We intend to continue to execute our business model and strategies, manage our company profitability and provide a high level of value to our stockholders. Turning now to highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2015; September quarter revenue and earnings per share results finished as expected. The new orders in Q1 ended below the guided range at $567 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers ended below the original forecast for the quarter. We believe this is due to two factors. First, there are many challenges associated with adopting the new technologies required to fabricate leading-edge transistor architectures. Second, tighter order lead times have become the norm in our industry today. And this coupled with a concentrated customer base is resulting in increased quarterly order variability. We currently expect a rebound in foundry order levels in the December quarter as customers move closer to the implementation of new capacity additions in leading-edge foundries that are expected to begin in the first half of calendar 2015. Although the September quarter bookings profile reflects an unusually low level activity from one of our foundry market customers in terms of next-generation FinFET build out, it’s clear that the battlefield for sub 20-nanometer competition has been formed with many players positioning to meet next-generation production ramp schedules. Recall the near record level of foundry orders booked by KLA-Tencorp in the single customer in the June quarter, with delivery dates for these orders slated for early 2015. These orders combined with a strong foundry order forecast for KLA-Tencor in the current quarter indicate the more aggressive pace of investment in FinFET capacity has begun. FinFET processes are extremely complex and challenging to bring to market. Our customers rely on KLA-Tencor to help address the ongoing yield issues associated with these new technologies. Logic orders came in largely as expected in the September quarter. Memory orders grew sequentially in the September quarter, with roughly a 50-50 split between DRAM and NAND Flash. DRAM customers are continuing their investments in 2x nanometer technology conversions. In addition to new capacity activity, the Flash demand continues to be focused on planar NAND. For KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the December quarter booking profile represents a meaningful pick up in order activity, largely driven by the leading-edge foundries as they move to prepare FinFET production capacity ahead of anticipated end customer demand in 2015. We expect December order quarter bookings to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, up approximately 40% at the midpoint from September. Guidance for revenue in the December quarter is in the range of $620 million to $700 million, and non GAAP earnings per share is projected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.70 in the quarter. December quarter EPS guidance does not consider the impact on other income and expense and tax rate related to the proposed recapitalization transaction. However, upon completion of the proposed transaction later in the quarter, we plan to update guidance to reflect the earnings impact of the proposed transaction. So, to wrap it up, KLA-Tencor is acknowledged as a the market leader in process control with a proven track record of consistently delivering industry-leading revenue growth, profitability and strong cash flow generation. KLA-Tencor’s strong business model and the ongoing successful execution of our strategic plans enable us to continue to invest in our business at a high level to fuel our growth and support our customer’s needs. We’re also delivering meaningful returns to stockholders as exemplified by today’s announcements. Today, the factors driving our growth in market leadership remain favorable. We’re confident in KLA-Tencor’s ability to drive innovation and help customers addressing the increasing cost and complexity of computing at the leading-edge. I’ll now turn it over to Bren for more details on today’s announcement and his perspective on the quarter.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Today, we’re very pleased to announce new dimensions to our capital allocation strategy. To support our ongoing commitments to return capital to stockholders, we plan to pursue a $4 billion leverage recapitalization featuring a $16.50 per share special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately 2.75 billion. The special cash dividend would be an addition to our regular $0.50 per share quarterly dividend. The intended special cash dividend will be funded in part with the portion of cash on the company’s balance sheet and in part with 2.5 billion incremental debt that will be added to the balance sheet. Our regular $0.50 per share quarterly cash dividend is expected to be declared and paid following our regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting in November 2014. In addition to the $16.50 per share special dividend, our Board of Directors has also approved an additional authorization of 3.6 million shares for our stock repurchase program, representing an additional $250 million increase over the $1 billion originally authorized in July. We expect to complete the new share repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months. Including the special cash dividend with an aggregate value of approximately $2.75 billion, the $250 million increase to the stock repurchase program announced today and the $1 billion stock repurchase program previously announced in July 2014, the total capitals will be directed to stockholders will be approximately $4 billion in aggregate. The aggregate value of the special dividend of approximately $2.75 billion includes the portion of the special cash dividend that could be payable to holders of outstanding equity award under the company’s 2004 equity incentive plan. This leverage recapitalization will add a more permanent tier of debt with longer maturity dates in our current nodes, thereby improving the efficiency of our balance sheet. As part of our recapitalization, we intend to issue incremental debt consisting of a pre-payable term loan facility which we intend to de-lever over the next three to five years and investment grade senior notes with staggered maturities. We also expect to enter into revolving credit facility. An unprecedented lending environment coupled with what we expect to be a robust capital spending profile in our industry over the next few years has enabled us to undertake this program and borrow above our long run debt target of 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA leverage to opportunistically optimize the company’s capital structure and enhance total stockholder returns over our base plan. We intend to maintain an investment grade rating. As Rick mentioned, our strategic positive remains strong, and we’re delivering superior cash flows and financial results. We entered the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 with over $2.9 billion of cash and investments with roughly two thirds of our through cycle cash flow generated in the U.S. As we look ahead, the near-term priorities for domestic cash include about $500 million of cash to fund operations on an ongoing basis. We’ll continue to execute the same strategies that have enabled us to sustain our market leadership and process control, deliver long-term revenue growth in excess of the market and deliver superior profitability and cash flows. As part of these market leadership and growth strategies, we’re committed to continuing to invest at high levels in research and development and evaluating perspective strategic growth opportunities that are complementary to our model. This is the formula for success that has served us well over the years in extending our market leadership, dealing strong cash flows and establishing KLA-Tencor among the leaders in returning value to stockholders. Our strategies for growth are driven by goal to deliver better than industry average revenue across the multiyear cycle and earnings growth targeted at 1.5 to 2 times revenue growth over time. We believe today’s news reflects our confidence in the prospects for continued successful execution of these strategies. As we execute on these long-term growth strategies, we plan to deliver returns to stockholders via dividends, through stock repurchases and by reinvesting in the business and ways to deliver sustainable value. We see today’s announcement as the next logical step in our ongoing efforts to drive stockholder value. Turning now to more specifics on the financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015; I’ll provide summary highlight in my commentary on the call today, please refer to the supplemental materials we had posted in the Investor Relations page in our Web site for additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. Revenue for Q1 was $643 million, above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter above midpoint of the guided range at $0.47 per share. Non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.50 per share at our guided tax rate of 22%. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you’ll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.04 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in today’s press release. New orders in Q1 were 567 million, below the guided bookings range for the quarter of 600 million to 800 million, as orders from one of our foundry market customers originally scheduled to be placed in the September quarter were pushed out. As Rick noted, we believe the delay in orders from this customer for FinFET ramp is partially a timing issue with this customer providing shorter lead times from order placement to shipment than we’ve seen in the past. Calendar 2015 is expected to be a year of growth for the semiconductor equipment industry with multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading-edge capacity and foundry, logic and memory in the year. With that said, we continue to experience low order visibility with a limited number of customers placing sizeable orders comprising the majority of our forecast. And as these plans change, driven by yield issues or lead time commitments, the impact on quarterly forecast accuracy is significant. Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the September quarter; foundry was 25% of new orders in Q1, and very low compared with recent history. In fact, orders from one of our foundry market leaders finished over $100 million below the original forecast, ending the unexpected low levels in Q1. Foundry demand is expected to rebound to 62% of orders in the December quarter. As Rick noted, the competitive battleground in next- generation foundry is taking shape. Incapacity plans for FinFET are lining up for the first half of calendar 2015. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be a strong broad based foundry demand for 16 and 14 nanometer nodes. Memory was 46% of new system orders in September, up sequentially both in terms of percentage of total orders and absolute dollars compared to June. Logic was 28% of new orders in September above the original forecast for the quarter. Customer investments in technology of 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 66% of the orders we received in Q1. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group; wafer inspection was approximately 49%, reticle inspection was approximately 3%, metrology was 15%, service was approximately 30%, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 3%. Total shipments in Q1 were 548 million and below the bottom end of the guided range of 600 million to 650 million as delivery timing for certain orders related the leading- edge foundry projects, originally expected to ship in the September quarter, shipped it into Q2 in early 2015. This is consistent with the conditions we experienced in the March and June quarters. The shipment delivery dates for tools currently in backlog are featuring extended lead times, resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near-term. We expect shipments in Q2 to grow approximately 40% sequentially at the midpoint of December guidance. We entered the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of $993 million of shipment backlog or orders that had not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six to nine months. Our current shipment backlog is at historic high levels for the company, providing the baseline for strong shipment and revenue growth as we convert this backlog in the coming quarters; $173 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced, but had not yet have been find out by customers. Turning to the income statement; the numbers show KLA-Tencor executed well operationally in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin, and EPS, all finishing in the upper end of the range of guidance. As I previously mentioned, revenue in September were 643 million, just about the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter. Gross margin was 55.6%; 100 basis points above the midpoint of the guided range for the quarter, in spite of the $91 million sequential decline in revenue. Gross margin exceeded our expectations in the quarter due to lower than forecasted parts cost in our service business and a favorable product mix in Q1. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 56% to 57% in December. Total operating expenses in the September quarter were 240 million, up sequentially about nine million compared with June, mainly due to higher employee-related cost in the quarter. Consistent with our expectations, prototype material costs for certain next-generation products are expected to be higher in the first half of our fiscal year versus the second half. But the December quarter, we are modeling operating expenses to be between $236 million and $238 million. Other income and expense was approximately $10 million in September, prior to the recapitalization, our expectation at OIE will be about 10 million in the December quarter. However, given the unknown currently surrounding the structure and timing of the proposed recapitalization, at this time we’re unable to guide OIE for the December quarter. We plan to provide detailed guidance update some time later this quarter to reflect the impact of the transaction on OIE tax rate earnings per share. Our effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter, above our long-term planning rate of about 22%. We believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be 22%, given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013. Given the low probability that this extension will occur in the December quarter, we are modeling a tax rate of 24% for the December quarter. Finally, net income for Q1 was 79 million or $0.47 per fully diluted share. I’ll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.94 billion, a decrease of 210 million compared with June. Sequential decline in our cash balances is largely due to staff repurchases and annual bonus payments in the quarter. Cash from operations was $35 million in the quarter. The sequential declining cash flow from operations in Q1 is consistent with seasonal trends and was driven in part by lower revenue levels as well as the timing of our annual bonus compensation payments in the quarter. In the September quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends and repurchased 125 million of our common stock. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under a 156 million. So with that, to reiterate our guidance for the December quarter is, bookings are expected to be within a range of 700 million to 900 million, shipment guidance for the December quarter in a range of 740 to 800 million, revenue between 620 and 700 million, and EPS of $0.46 to $0.70 per share, exclusive of the impact of the recapitalization. Once again, we plan to provide an update in the December quarter guidance that will reflect the impact of the proposed recapitalization concurrent with the currently scheduled closing of the transaction later this quarter. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we’d like to open up the call to questions and we once again request that you limit yourself to one question in one follow-up, given the limited time we have for today’s call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we’ll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. So, Mike, we’re ready for your first question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. Rick, can you just talk about briefly like why you chose to do a special dividend instead of buybacks, and what were the puts and takes in making the decision?
 Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of John. Rick, can you just talk about briefly like why you chose to do a special dividend instead of buybacks, and what were the puts and takes in making the decision?
Richard Wallace: Hi. Well, I’ll give an overview and then I’ll turn it over to Bren to get the specifics. So look, the way we look at it, there are three uses of cash. And the primary use is to fund our organic growth and we fully satisfy that, and we continue to build upon that. The second is to look for accretive and enabling M&A. And we’ve done those things and continue to evaluate those and we feel we can do them. And then the third one is returning cash to shareholders and in that we look for the most efficient way, an effective way to do that, considering a lot of factors including who our shareholders are. And also the size of the return and what’s most efficient. And so, from that I’ll hand it to Bren.
Bren Higgins: So I think anytime you consider a large return to capital, I mean certainly we start from an assessment of our business around how much cash can the business have, what kind of reserves do we need, also, the potential debt capacity of the company. And so as we looked at that and to Rick’s point as we assessed our options, we clearly did not see at least for now, anything on the M&A front that looked as compelling to shareholder value is what we’re doing here today. But given the size of the transaction itself, the practice of trying to execute a share repurchase is difficult. There is a tender offer and the premiums and all those kinds of things, and I think it really comes back to Rick’s point, who are our shareholders, what did they value? We think our shareholders value our dividend practice, our practice of returning cash, the ability to treat all shareholders the same, and the timeliness and efficiency of the execution. There is a piece of this obviously, that is share repurchase that we will execute over time. We made the previous announcement back in July, up a billion dollars that which was executed a 125 million and we added another 250 to that. So we will be executing that over time as another component. There are I think different opinions on what’s the best approach. I think it goes back to how we think about our business. How much cash do we need and ultimately we made the call to do it this way where we feel like we’re optimizing between the two vehicles.
Farhan Rizvi : Thank you. And just one question in terms of the calendar first half of next year, what kind of pick up are you expecting in the first half of next year?
 Credit Suisse: Thank you. And just one question in terms of the calendar first half of next year, what kind of pick up are you expecting in the first half of next year?
Richard Wallace: Well, as you know, we don’t guide beyond the next quarter, but overall for calendar 2015, I think it is setting up nicely for heavily investment in FinFET across the board. And when we look at our foundry customers, really nobody is shipping products today on a large volume with FinFET devices. And I think by the end of calendar 2015, the expectation is there’ll be multiple devices from multiple suppliers of FinFET technology. So that bodes well for investment. So what we’re anticipating, as we said for the December quarter is a pickup in investment associated with that. But then throughout 2015, the way the plans look and the way our customers are talking to us about it, I think we’ll see multiple players supporting that ramp.
Bren Higgins: Yes, I think the only thing I would add to that is given the timing of the second half of the year to be delivering product, it does make sense that you start to see capacity ramping in the first half of the year. Certainly, we are driving our supply chain in building towards that expectation. And I think it lines up with the end market dynamics that Rick mentioned.
Farhan Rizvi : Thank you. That’s all I have.
 Credit Suisse: Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: Your next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen: Thanks a lot guys. Two things; first of all, Rick, I’m curious if you can talk about the FinFET timing issues and if it’s possible to segment it out whether it’s process-related or some of it is like customer-related IE, like your customers, a lot of obvious uncertainty out there. And so I’m wondering whether you could segment the two, and then I had a follow-up. Thanks.
Richard Wallace: Sure. From what we understand in talking to our customers, I think there is a desire by the end customers to get to the technology, but there is an inability right now in general to have a large scale deployment of technologies that are reliable enough to be deployed in high volume. So I think that that’s really limiting. Like I said, we expect the first commercial devices to come out, consumer devices to come out by the end of the calendar year within that technology. But that’s really only from one supplier. The other ones are working through a number of issues and there are associated challenges with defect density but also structural reliability. And I think that for people that haven’t done FinFET, it’s turning out to be a very challenging process. So I think there is a lot of effort going on to deal with that. As you know there has been some success in 20-nanometer. So given that that’s made it into the current product cycle, we’re really talking about a next product cycle which I think is as soon as we expect to see volume, is mid calendar year of 2015. So, as I said, we expect investment to be ramping in dealing with some of those challenges. But the people that are in front on FinFET struggle quite a bit getting yield on them and we were involved and work you through some of those challenges. So I don’t think it’s going to be easy. And I think that on the one hand we’re enabling that but on the other hand, until it starts to work there’s not going to be a lot of customer demands, not a lot to tape out. But then I expect to see an avalanche of demand once the process start working.
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess, just a follow-up to the prior question about the decision to pay a special dividend. Why would you decide to do that when you’re about to put up a quarter that where the guidance is definitely disappointing relative to what Street was thinking and you could have maybe bought stock back at a much, much lower price. I guess I’m just wondering that calculus around paying that special dividend versus maybe doing an ASR post these results, something like that. Thanks.
Richard Wallace: Sure. Well, as you can imagine, this is Rick, I’ll start with an overview and then let Bren fill it in. First of all, this wasn’t a decision that was something about a near-term decision, that is a long-term decision around the capital structure of the company, something that they’re working at for quite a while to figure out what is the right way to position the company and structure it. So it’s independent of ups and downs of particularly the quarters and we certainly are market timers. So we look at that, and we say "What’s the best way, what’s the best capital structure?" And then, in this case, there is a blend, but it’s obviously greater in the special dividend and it’s the most efficient way to be able to return cash to shareholders. If that was really thinking, it wasn’t meant to be coincident with any particular quarter. It just happened to coincide.
Bren Higgins: The other thing I think I’ll add is clearly the ability to finance this was driven by a very attractive debt market both in terms of rates, terms, and financial flexibility. Also, our view on being able to overshoot or go further than our long-term target of 2 to 2.5 times leverage was also driven by our views of capital intensity and healthy capital spending environment over the next couple of years to enable us to de-leverage some of this debt we’re taking on back to our target. I’ve been saying, I think for I think even going back to May and even in the SEMICON that we felt like it made sense for our company given the dynamics or secular dynamics or business model, the barriers to entry, our market share that more assertive capital structure would drive additional value to our shareholders. And so, this was a process, we made the share repurchase announcement. At the time, we said that that was the first step; this is the next step. So we talk a lot already about the pros and cons of the vehicle, but at the same time I just want to give you a little bit of insight in terms of how we’re thinking about it.
Timothy Arcuri – Cowen: Okay, Bren. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from C.J. Muse with ISI Group.
C.J. Muse – ISI Group: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, if I could – I’ll try to ask both my questions at once as they’re partially related. I guess, first off, when you consider this special dividend, I’m curious whether you focused it all on the M&A side or increased R&D. When I look at your relative to position to WFE over the last two years, you underperform by about eight points each year. I’d would love to hear your thoughts on whether that was a consideration, and how you’re going to rectify this relative underperformance that is going on at least for the last few years. And then second part of the question is flexibility. If I look at you guys perform a post-transaction, roughly 20% debt to cap and roughly 2/3rds of your free cash flow will cover interest and dividend. And I’m wondering if that’s enough flexibility for what may come for what is still a cyclical industry. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Yes. C.J., I’ll take part of it and then again, Bren can look at it. Yes, we can talk about the relative performance. I think as you’re well aware, we have a – we’re biased towards increased adoption in logic and foundry and less so in memory, although memory is increasing. And what we’ve seen this year clearly is that the memory investment has been higher than maybe anticipated originally and has continued to go up. We expect that trend to reverse a little bit in 2015 where we do see the foundry customers increasing their investment, and in our expectations, memory will probably normally hold to what they’re doing in 2014. So I think the mix becomes favorable for us. So we look at over the long-term. The second part, I look at is a big change in the company and the industry I think has to do with – while the near-term volatility has increased, the longer term volatility has actually decreased because of the efficiencies associated with consolidation. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence is in our ability to service the debt and do everything else that we want to do, is a growing service business, which is much more aligned with what’s going on in overall semiconductor manufacturing. And we just looked and we had seven consecutive growth of service business. And so we look at that as a business that can feel and can help dramatically service this debt. Bren, do you want to fill in?
Bren Higgins: Yes, C.J., I think you mentioned operational investment and I think that we have ramped up our investment to support our businesses. We have a product cadence that’s 2XR competitors. So we believe we are investing enough in our business to be able to maintain our market position, and I think that the underperformance that you talk about is more driven by – it’s the most sensitive element I think, and that is to explain more about customer mix than anything else. From a flexibility perspective, we are using our offshore cash in this transaction. There is an unfunded revolver that’s a component to it. We also plan to have about 500 million in the U.S. We’re going to execute the share repurchase over time. And certainly there are some elements that provide flexibility there. As you know, covering this industry for a long time, this is not a capital intensive industry, and so, we don’t need a lot of cash to run the business. We have to grow in service business, that’s a bigger percentage of the revenue. So, a much more comfortable, given the cyclical dynamics as well, I think we’re much more comfortable with the risk profile. Then, our intent is to de-lever a significant portion of this rather quickly over the next couple of years. So, all that coupled with the cost of the debt plus the outlook that we have, we think that it’s a prudent structure, and I think we expect our debt to be investment grade and I think that also reflects the structure and our ability to execute our strategies without the risk or the financial distress that affect – sometimes goes with that. So … 
Ed Lockwood:  Operator, next question?
Operator: And the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one I had was just a follow-up on the special dividend recap question. Is it set as you had just pointed, you probably lived around and found out no suitable M&A candidates and decided this is a better way to return capital? And does it impact your 6.9% convert due in a few years? And I have a follow-up?
Bren Higgins: Again from the strategic perspective, we have looked at opportunities, we continued to look at opportunities to enable further growth and look for things that are going to be accretive to either our current business or places to grow. And when we evaluate that, we feel very well positioned with the product portfolio that we’ve developed organically or through the M&A that we’ve done in the past. And we’ve said this on a number of occasions. While we look, we don’t see anything that’s so compelling that we wanted to move in the past, or would have and we always compare the returns that we’d get from that from what returns we get from an action like this. Second one is we still can do M&A. If there is M&A that’s compelling and accretive over time, we’re not limited to do that. And so, our view is this doesn’t disable that option. It just would have to pass hurdles that we make it long-term accretive to our company and that’s always been the case. So we don’t think that we’re limited in anyway from the deals that we anticipate might come our way as we look forward. And then on the question on the 2018 debt, so that’s straight corporate debt and option under consideration is do we – we may consider refinancing that. The financing is not complete yet, we don’t want to get into the details ultimately of the various aspects of it. It’s an option under consideration, and we’ll update you at the appropriate time.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, it looks like there is lot of activity going on in the foundry side, besides the FinFET-related yield issues, have you guys seen any pick up or incremental sales for 28-nanometer or are you just focused mostly on 20, 16, 14 at this point?
Bren Higgins: We do have some forecast in this. We did expect in the second half to see some incremental 28-nanometer activity. We didn’t see that in the September quarter. We do expect some of that business in the December quarter. I think some of the lithography orders happened in the September quarter, and I think just given general lead time dynamics that would imply that other tools will follow. So we do expect some of that business. I thought we’d see some of that in September and it looks like I’m going to see maybe more of it in September – December quarter now.
Richard Wallace: Yes, clearly there are players that haven’t participated with that as a leading-edge node for them that have come to us for support and help, and to Bren’s brands point, we expect to see that because as you know, that’s the node that’s probably generating a lot of the revenue and cash flow for the industry right now, not the very leading-edge stuff.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thanks, Rick, Thanks Bren.
Richard Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.
Bill Peterson – JPMorgan: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. This is Bill Peterson calling on behalf of Harlan. Congratulations on the recapitalization program. The question is actually more about the outlook particularly in the 2015. Wondering, with typically long lead times orders in hand, coupled with orders you expect in December, how do you see 2015 playing out in terms of first half, first second half? I understand – I’m not looking for a forecast, but how do you see that playing out. And then I have a follow-up question.
Bren Higgins: So, Bill, I think the first half given the earlier comments, we think the first half should be strong given the ramp we expected associated with 16, 14 nanometers. Beyond that, though – it’s hard for me to guess, I think we’re consistent with everybody else. We see it as a year growth as we said in the prepared remarks. In the first half, we’re certainly building to support a strong shipment profile through the first half.
Bill Peterson – JPMorgan: Okay. And I guess the second part is, I guess, should we expect with some customers that the sort of lead times would be I guess become a new norm or is there something else that play, I’m just kind of curios in your thoughts on where the typical lead times would be going between the key foundry?
Bren Higgins: Lead times have been coming in over the last few years. I think one of the byproducts of the mobility-driven cycle that we’ve been in since 2010 is because it’s consumer-centric. Our customers are more sensitive to consumer dynamic. They have less lead time, and so some of that lack a visibility passes through. It tends to be customer-specific. As we saw on the June quarter, we booked a significant amount of business in the foundry from a customer its end of the lead times. And I think based on another customer that we expect to see some activity from here coming up to support the ramp we talked about. The lead times are pulling in. So it tends to vary across customers. But over time I think we’ve seen them shrink. I mean, we’re still sitting, I think we ended the quarter around five months a backlog, but it isn’t six to seven months of backlog. And as we model it going forward, we model somewhere between four and five months generally. It does mean that we carry more inventory to be flexible, and that’s certainly a dynamic that we has changed in terms of how we manage the company and the business. But we need to be able to respond and these are big orders from single customers and so we have to be sensitive and flexible to their plans.
Richard Wallace: And I think in general, Bill, as you know at the industry has transitioned much more of consumer-orientation for devices, and that drives the business. It’s our customers don’t really have a lot of visibility? So they’re asking us to be responsive to their need to respond quickly. And I think in exchange for that, what we get is pretty close collaboration on their needs. We just don’t get great inside entertaining largely because in many cases they are not sure. So we have a lot of provisional plans that change pretty quickly and we try to synchronize those, but it’s a challenge because the end markets move and the players are all trying to be positioned to take share when it’s available to them. So we have to support that and to Bren’s point, we’ve taken on some inventory to be able to do that.
Bill Peterson – JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks for that color, and good luck.
Bren Higgins: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC: Thank you, very much. Rick, you talk about next year – one of your peers talk about next year up, 5% to 10%. Let’s say if the CapEx next year is up 5%, where do you think your revenue can track in that environment?
Richard Wallace: I’ll give that to Bren.
Bren Higgins: So, Mahesh, I think a lot of it depends on the customer mix. I think after two years where we had pretty heavy memory spending, I think, underperformance relative to the market, I think with a ramp of a new technology we think that we should be able to go with the market in the next year. That certainly have, we’re modeling it. But I think that’s the more sensitive item. I mean, over the last couple of years I think it’s been just a fundamental delay I think around some of the new technologies, whether on the NAND side or even in the foundry. And certainly that’s put pressure on process control because the customer buying patterns are typically heavier when they’re ramping technology. So, given the assumption of the ramp into next year, we do believe that next year positions as for its growing at least that the market rate, and perhaps faster if process control intensity moves the way we think they’re going to move on these new technology.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC: And the second question on the debt. I’m assuming that this is a special dividend and you’re paying the basis. So, it’s going to be tax-free to the investors. And also if you can give us some math around why do you need 2.5 billion of debt to fund this and because you have so much pretty good amount of cash in U.S.?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So the dividend versus return of capital calculation, which gets in whenever you pay a large special portion of it is dividend, and based on the tax retainer in over time, a piece could be return to capital. We don’t have the specifics on that to share with you today. We’ll share with that with you when we ultimately get where we pay the special. So that’s how that works. On the amount of debt, the way we thought about it was how far, how much debt could we borrow, we want to maintain investment grade profile as we said. We also had a plan around share repurchase. And so, once we pay the special and then go through the share repurchase commitment, we will have the U.S. cash number right around 500 million. And then most of – the way I am thinking about over time, the way we will drive this is our free cash flow into the U.S. will pay our ongoing dividend, and then the remainder will be targeted towards de-leveraging back to our long-term target to 2 to 2.5 times EBITDA. So that’s how we’re thinking about it. I think the overall scope was driven by what’s prudent for us, and also, clearly we thought it was important to maintain investment group profile through this.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
Bren Higgins:  Welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Jim Covello, your line is open.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, operator, next question?
Operator: Your next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok – Needham: Great, thanks for taking my question. So first question, we’ve seen quite a bit of activity by (indiscernible) around the 10-nanometer logic process right now. And I’m little surprised at your mask inspection order is low this quarter, I would suspect that some of those guys who start to order mask inspection tool for 10 nanometer. Can you give some color around that where is mask inspection and do you expect incremental order around 10-nanometer on mask inspection number one and then relate to that as, do you expect ramp up in those 10-nanometer activity to benefit you in 2015?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Edwin it’s a good question. So mask inspection particularly around the mash up in your lumpy business, we had a decent quarter in June and we have a forecast for decent quarter in December. So there is some lumpiness to the order profile. As you might recall, and we’re fairly open with this, we did book for a leading logic manufacture, we did both in multiple set of mash ups rules to support the 10-nanometer node with those tools shipping over the course of 2015, so with a lot of it in the first half of 2015. So, there is some activity there. I think we’ll start to see more of that activity as we move forward. I don’t know how much of it we’ll see in December. But clearly that’s an aspect obviously of this transition to 10, but very limited activity on 10. I don’t think we’ll start seeing orders for 10-nanometer beyond what we’ve seen in very early development stuff, I don’t think you will see any meaningful orders until we get closer to the end of next year.
Richard Wallace: And to that point, the existing capability that we have can support the pilot and R&D work. And given the fact that there are few sub 20-nanometer designs working anywhere except for some that one customer that then there is a lot of, there is capacity in the system to handle things until we see very ramp up of 14, 16, that will start to consume some capacity. And then the 10 is really been as Bren said in the path finding usage for the reticle tool. So, (indiscernible) is just not going to – and it’s going to be lumpy but it’s not going to be eminent given the 10 nanometer so far out.
Edwin Mok – Needham: I see, okay. That’s helpful. And then just talk about your commentary on the first half of 2015, you said strong driven by the 16, 14 nanometer investment from your customer. What about the memory side? Are we at least – are you seeing any subsiding in investment memory or do you think that we remain strong in the first half or is it more called back-half loaded in the memory side. What color can you provide to us? Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Yes, I’ll give my perspective, and Bren can way in. I haven’t seen a lot of expectations of the building. I think that the strength and memory probably continues through 2015 at some level, probably not growing from here though. And most of the investment in Flash has been, as we talked in the past, plainer than 3D, there have been some in 3D but I think 3D is yet to come and that will be dependent on a number of factors, although we’re participating in that. And then the DRAM side, we do see technology investment going and there are definitely some capacity ads being pursued. So I think memory, I don’t see a big difference between Q1 and Q2, or I’m sorry, first half or second half of 2015 for that. As you know, we don’t really forecast that far out into – our visibility is pretty limited in terms of exactly where things are going to fall. So we struggle to predict much beyond what we’re going to see in December.
Edwin Mok – Needham: Great, that’s actually very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Atif Malik – Citigroup: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and then congratulations with the team with the special dividend. And the comment on FinFET push outs are quite understandable given your peers, (indiscernible) also talked about the uncertainty in the foundry markets. My question is on the lead times, Rick, and then for the same lines as Tim was alluding to. So if your customer’s customers, they have to make their devices, let’s say September next year, when is the latest pick in order of your (indiscernible) I’m just trying to gauge if there is further risk in these bookings pushing out into the March quarter given your lead times that longer than your peers. And then, I have a follow-up.
Richard Wallace: Yes, I think, given what we’re seeing, I think that there is a sensitivity clearly to the end market dynamics there and I expected – frankly, I expected the orders in September. So I have some orders forecasted in December. And certainly that’s the plan based on what we see today. But it does as we’ve seen it has been a little bit fluid. I think given the calendar timing that we’ve talked about and roughly three month cycle times on devices, you really have to start I think putting that capacity in place in the March and June quarters be able to deliver those schedules. And so that’s I think the calendar, that our cadence that we’re looking at in terms of expected delivery. But could it be a situation where I get very short lead times, I guess I get orders from customers and they turn around and run shipments in a couple of weeks. That could happen. I wouldn’t be surprised if it does at some level, but this is – we’re trying to give you as much guidance as we get based on the conversations we’re having with the customer. And certainly, we’re positioned to be able to respond with the flexibility to be able to deliver in a meaningful way end of the first half of the year.
Bren Higgins: Yes, until the point of – if you might have last two quarters, [we missed] (ph) low in terms of the midpoint and the June quarter, we miss high and then this low. So we’re not very good at forecasting the next 90 days. And so, we really think about it in a longer term basis and the way I think about it, how it’s adoption relative to our model and expectation and how we’re doing relative to share. And timing is something we have less influence over. But certainly from an adoption standpoint, we’re seeing it. I think 14 and 16 will be good adoption for – we’ll see strong adoption for process control, but we’re not seeing it yet because that investment is not there. I think our market share continues to be strong. But until they place few orders, we don’t know. So, it is true, we’re going to be I think short term very bald all in terms of the ins and outs.
Atif Malik – Citigroup: Got it. And then as a follow-up, you guys talked about the 2D NAND investments are more dominant right now than then CD investment. Could you rank for us the reason for that? Is it that economics of CD are not at par with 2D or that’s yield-related or just memory makers are just trying to keep a tight supply/demand balance as 3D could add more depth in the market?
Richard Wallace: Well, clearly, there is a continuum of process maturity for the different providers. Right, yes. People that are already yielding devices and enable the ship and shipping in small volume, the other still in development, you have others early on development. So, I think it really ranges whereas 2D capacity is much broader. So, to the degree there is market demand for NAND. I think there is a big opportunity for everybody to participate in that. So, you’re going to see planar NAND continue. I do believe that people have underestimated the challenges in 3D both in NAND and also in FinFET, in terms of integration and yield and some of that we can help with and some of that’s just debugging the processes. So, when there is a robust market environment, I think many of our customers will produce the products that they can produce. But the crossover plain, once the 3D is working of 3D flash is going to be compelling as well. But it’s got working in get to economics that makes sense. And we anticipate as soon as that happens in calendar 2015. But it’s kind of a bit of both, the economics don’t work, the demand isn’t there but if it does work, there is a lot of interest in the customers for it.
Atif Malik – Citigroup: All right, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Chen with UBS.
Stephen Chen – UBS: Thanks. Hi, Rick and Bren. Just a follow-up question on the recapitalization, did the company consider a management buyout in perhaps seeking shares from the put and take and why not just the management buy out here?
Richard Wallace: No. We didn’t consider. This was given our situation that wasn’t something we consider. What we considered was what’s a prudent level of debt that the company should be taking on to optimize our capital structure and then what’s the best way, the most efficient way to return cash to shareholders after we’ve gone through and evaluated uses one and two of cash, which is invest in our business, look at accretive M&A or enabling technology. But no, we didn’t, we weren’t looking at management buyout.
Bren Higgins: I think when you have a business like ours that has strong technology position, a differential margins, the ability to invest and therefore generate strong operating margins and a strong cash flow profile. I think you take that and you cover it with, what we clearly see our changes in the mix that of our industry that lends itself to I think a more predictable earnings stream overtime. And so, business like that certainly has the capacity to carry more debt and to Rick’s point, when you look at the first two considerations which we work through, at least for now, as we saw this is the best opportunity to deliver incremental value to our shareholders as we execute what we believe is a very solid plan going forward. So that was the thought process. And again, the level of debt determined by our goal of what makes sense for our business as exhibited by the investment grade profile that we have and then obviously how do we move forward with it?
Stephen Chen – UBS: Okay. Thanks for that, Bren. And then just a follow-up on the ongoing business, so it looks like you’re seeing the improved gross margins in both the September and December quarter, I missed the main driver that got you back into the gross margin range in September, does it – the period that you’ve overcome those issues that occurred in the June quarter? Thanks.
Bren Higgins: Yes. The June quarter I had a couple of issues on revenue mix where some of the tools that came in on the revenue side had a weaker revenue mix profile. And I also had higher than expected cost in my service business. And so that drove one-time weakness, if you’ll, into the June quarter. I think we saw a very normal gross margin structure play out as we went into this quarter, something more consistent with what we’ve seen historically and consistent with our model. So the mix turned out to be a little bit more favorable, and I think the dynamics I saw on the service business corrected and it’s more consistent with our expectation for that. So – and I think as we look into the December quarter, the same dynamics play out.
Stephen Chen – UBS: Okay. Thanks, Bren.
Bren Higgins: You’re welcome.
Operator: The next question is from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good evening everyone. This is Sean on for Ruben. I just wonder if you could give us an update on how you’re thinking about gross margin, gross margin profile for 2015, given the ramp that you’re seeing for 16 and 14 and then just opportunities for expansion headwinds there, just some kind of directional indication of how things could play out.
Bren Higgins: Yes. The gross margin profile on our latest products that we’ve introduced is actually – is very solid and very consistent with our historical pattern. We believe we’ll see incremental gross margins between 60% and 70% going forward through 2015. And so, I think we’re very well positioned as we see this pick up in business into the first half of the year for very good gross margin performance and very consistent with our historical model.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, and if we get the – you talked a little bit about ongoing focus on investment in the business, I’m just trying to think about your OpEx levels into 2015, is this something that will continue to grow, how do we think about the magnitude of that growth or whether it’s roughly consistent with where we see it currently?
Bren Higgins: Well, the first half of this fiscal year, the September quarter and the December quarter coming up, I expect it to be a higher OpEx level than we expected in the second half. And that was driven by some programmatic timing on some next-generation programs. So I think the second half of the year comes down from the first half, I’m modeling the year right now, the fiscal year around 935 million, so given the performance in Q1, and what we guided for Q2 does imply somewhere around that $230 million range in the March and June quarters. And so, our OpEx levels are really dependant on what’s required to support our roadmaps. And I think we’re not necessarily on where the revenue level is. So if the business is stronger, I don’t think it changes our OpEx all that much, it turns out to be marginally weaker. I don’t think it changes that much either. So it’s really driven by the business requirements in maintaining the differentiation that we need to support the gross margin profile that enabled that investment.
Richard Wallace: Yes, just to add to that; one of the big initiatives we have been investing in this is what we call the 5D solution for lithography from multi-patterning, and well, we’re seeing little bit of revenue from those efforts. I think that’s an investment that will show up in future years as we continue to build out the suite of products and solutions we have to support multi-patterning going forward. So that’s part of the step up in the increase, but to Bren’s point, we’re looking to don’t see dramatic increases beyond our current levels, but we’ll continue to invest in the business as we go forward.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, that’s very helpful. Thank you. That’s it.
Operator: The last question is from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, thanks for squeezing in it. I have three really easy questions; one is, shipments last quarter you expected – you said you expected shipments to trend higher each quarter through the fiscal year. It sounds like you’re saying the same thing today, but I wanted to verify that, that is the case. The second question is – I’m just – if you could remind us how much cash you currently have off-shore? And then the third is, are you planning share count for the December quarter?
Richard Wallace: On shipments, we guided next quarter at 70 at the midpoint. And yes, I think given the commentary around the second or the first half of (technical difficulty) exact number, but about 1.2 billion at this point of the total of the 2.9. And share count that we’re modeling is about 165 million in December.
Weston Twigg – Pacific Crest Securities: Very helpful, thank you.
Richard Wallace: You’re welcome.
Ed Lockwood: Operator, that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining, and we look forward to seeing you later on in this quarter.

Operator: Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Liane, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] Ed Lockwood, KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ted Lockwood: Thank you, Liane. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2014. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3000 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013 (sic) [ 2014 ], and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Bren will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials. KLA-Tencor's fourth quarter results culminate a year of strong operating and financial performance for the company, as well as solid execution of our strategic objectives. Our June quarter report is highlighted by achievement of the second highest net bookings result of the company's history in fiscal 2014, including record bookings for our wafer inspection products in the year. This demonstrates our customer focus and market leadership, as well as the critical role KLA-Tencor plays in helping our customers address the higher cost and complexity associated with competing at the leading edge. Additionally, we announced earlier this month, our Board of Directors has authorized significant increases to the company's program to return cash to stockholders. These enhancements include an 11% increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, as well as an increase of 13 million additional shares to the company share repurchase authorization, which brings the value of the shares remaining available for repurchase under our program to approximately $1 billion using our current stock price. This meaningful increase and the targeted amount of cash being returned to stockholders is reflected -- reflective of our more assertive capital deployment strategy. Now for some perspective on the current demand environment. New orders for June were $898 million, 24% above the midpoint of guidance with strong foundry bookings for the sub-20 nanometer and upside to DRAM forecast leading the way. In foundry, we're encouraged by the strength of the upside in the June quarter, with foundry orders nearly doubling compared to the March quarter. We believe the magnitude of these orders reflect our market leadership and the critical nature of process control in enabling the adoption of 3D technologies. However, as we indicated at SEMICON West, the upside in the foundry orders in Q4 was concentrated with a single customer. Delivery of these orders are not slotted to begin until later this year, and they are expected to extend into calendar 2015. The timing of those shipments combined with the uncertainty of our plans for sub-20 nanometer capacity additions among the other major foundries for the remainder of calendar 2014 continues to put pressure on the outlook for foundry spending in the year. However, we believe this also sets up a strong year for foundry in 2015 as we expect to see broader customer participation and a steady focus on ramping 16- and 14-nanometer technologies. Logic orders came in largely as expected in the June quarter. Memory orders also grew sequentially in the June quarter, driven by strength in DRAM with customers continuing their investment in 2X nanometer technology conversions. In NAND flash, order's levels continue to be modest and focused on planar NAND. For KLA-Tencor, our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission is to help our customers navigate the ever-changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $800 million with about 70% of systems orders concentrated among foundry and logic customers in the quarter. Guidance for revenue in the September quarter is in the range of $590 million to $650 million with non-GAAP earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.54 in the quarter. Our September quarter revenue and EPS guidance reflect a longer shipment lead time associated with the recent quarter flow. With our current backlog, coupled with the anticipated order profile for the second half of the year, we expect shipment and revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his review of the numbers.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q4 and my perspective on current trends in the marketplace and our outlook for the second half of calendar year 2014. Revenue for Q4 was $734 million, just above the midpoint of guidance, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.77. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter below the midpoint of the guided range at $0.80 per share. In our press release and our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.03 difference in EPS. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments covered in today's press release. New orders in Q4 were $898 million, significantly above the guided bookings range for the quarter of $625 million to $825 million as we saw upside in our original order forecast from one of our foundry customers and from DRAM. We are encouraged by the strong demand in the June quarter as we believe it speaks to the value of process control in helping our customers navigate the complex transition from planar to 3D structures. Also, as Rick mentioned, since these orders are largely scheduled to ship in revenue in calendar '15, we think this very strong order activity sets the stage for 2015 to be another year of strong relative growth for process control and what industry analysts expect to be a growth year for the semiconductor equipment industry. We expect to have multiple customers simultaneously ramping new leading edge capacity featuring 3D designs in foundry, logic and memory in 2015. Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the June quarter. Foundry demand was 68% of new orders for Q4, consistent with our expectations as a percentage of the overall mix of orders but higher in dollar terms compared with March. Foundry orders in Q4 featured nearly $300 million in system orders from one customer to largely support 14-nanometer activities. These orders are scheduled to begin shipping later in the current calendar year and revenue in calendar year '15. I would note that these orders are not a pull-in and represent significant upside to original forecast for this customer. Clearly, the competitive battleground for 3D foundry is taking shape, and as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to benefit from what we expect to be strong, broad-based foundry demand at the 16- and 14-nanometer nodes. Memory was 23% of new system orders in June, up sequentially both in terms of percent of total orders and absolute dollars compared with March. Memory demand in the June quarter was highlighted by another good quarter for DRAM. Notably, we delivered upside to our original memory forecast for June even with orders from Korea finishing significantly below the quarterly levels we've seen over the past few years. We think this indicates good breadth of demand among the market leaders in leading edge memory and also points to the quarterly variability of individual customer demand in our highly concentrated end market. Logic was 9% of new orders in June, down slightly compared with the original forecast. Customer investments in technology at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 75% of the orders we received in the June quarter. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group. Wafer inspection was approximately 55%. As Rick mentioned, total orders for our wafer inspection products were a record in fiscal '14, finishing in excess of $1.5 billion for the year. Reticle inspection was approximately 10%; metrology was approximately 14%; service was 19%; storage, High Brightness LED and other nonsemi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in Q4 were $694 million and below the guided range as delivery timing for certain orders related to leading edge foundry and NAND projects originally scheduled to ship in the June quarter shifted into the second half of 2014. This is consistent with the conditions we experienced in our March quarter. In general, our shipment profile associated with our recent bookings features extended lead times and is resulting in a lower quarterly shipment profile over the near term. Looking forward, given our June orders and our September bookings forecast, we are currently modeling December quarter shipments above $800 million with sequential quarterly growth in shipments expected to continue through the remainder of fiscal '15. September quarterly shipments are expected to be in the range of $600 million to $660 million. In total, we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion of total backlog comprised of: $977 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months; and $269 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed up by customers. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $734 million, down 12% sequentially from the March quarter and just above the midpoint of guidance. We expect revenue in the range of $590 million to $650 million in the September quarter, driven by a lower shipment's forecast resulting from the extended lead times in our current shipment backlog that I just discussed. Given our strong backlog, we expect revenue growth to resume in the December quarter. Gross margin was 56%, down compared with the March quarter and 150 basis points lower than the midpoint of the guidance range we've provided due to a less favorable mix of products that revenue-ed in the quarter and higher-than-expected costs in our service business. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 54% to 55% in September, largely a function of the lower revenue forecast for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $231 million, up about $5 million sequentially over the March quarter and just above our guidance range of $225 million to $230 million, mainly due to material and personnel costs associated with next-generation product development programs. Going forward, we expect quarterly operating expenses in the $230 million to $235 million range, reflecting higher product development costs associated with our ongoing investments in next-generation technologies to meet customer requirements and extend our market leadership. Our effective tax rate was 23% in the quarter, in line with our long-term planning rate. For modeling purposes going forward, we believe the appropriate long-term planning rate should be reduced to 22% given our expectations for the mix of business over the next few years. The 22% planning rate also assumes the U.S. R&D tax credit that expired at the end of calendar year 2013 will be reinstated at some point during the next 12 months. Finally, net income for the June quarter was $133 million or $0.80 per fully diluted share. I'll turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $3.15 billion, an increase of $126 million compared with March. Cash from operations was $249 million in the quarter, up $11 million sequentially over the March quarter, and free cash flow was $236 million. In the quarter, we paid $74 million in dividends and repurchased $60 million of our common stock at an average price of $66.19. As Rick mentioned, our Board of Directors recently increased the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, and also authorized us to repurchase an additional 13 million shares of our common stock. As of June 30, we had approximately 2 million shares available for repurchase under our existing authorization, so the board's recent increase brings the value of the shares remaining available for repurchase under our program to approximately $1 billion using our current stock price. We currently plan to execute this repurchase program over the next 12 to 18 months. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over $167 million. We are pleased with the strong bookings result for the June quarter as we believe it speaks to our market leadership and the critical nature of process control and helping our customers address the increasing cost and complexity associated with the transition from planar to 3D device architectures. However, the extended lead time associated with these orders is having an impact on shipments in the near term and resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and EPS guidance for the September quarter. We see this as a temporary anomaly with shipment and revenue growth forecasted to resume in the December quarter and setting the stage for what we expect to be a strong growth year for KLA-Tencor in calendar year 2015. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the September quarter is: bookings are expected to be within the range of $600 million to $800 million; revenue, between $590 million and $650 million; and earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.54 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ted Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to questions. [Operator Instructions] Feel free to requeue for your follow-up questions, and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for further questions as time permits. So Liane, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, first question, considering the extended lead times that you're seeing, particularly on the foundry side, I'm wondering if that extends also into other customers into 2015. What I'm trying to get at is how do you see the ramp in terms of '16, '14 spend and, therefore, the linearity to shipments the foundry gets for you guys into the next year?
Bren Higgins: C.J., good question. Thanks, it's Bren. So I think as we look out going forward here, I think that clearly, this -- and I talked about it at SEMICON West where we had effectively one customer that we're expecting to ship somewhere close to $100 million to -- in the September quarter and we plan to book those orders in June. That business fell out; other businesses came in to replace it. And so it did put a bit of a hole into the shipment forecast for the quarter. I think going forward, as we said in the prepared remarks, we see the shipment trajectory of being positive, and we'll see a resumption of growth into December. And as we said in the remarks, it looks like it's greater than $800 million or so. I think it's interesting. It is fairly fluid in terms of timing or it has been, although, I think that those -- these orders that we did see in the quarter in foundry are a, I think, a good confidence point in terms of timing and when we expect that capacity to get added as we go into the first part of 2015. So we'll see. I mean, there has been a fair amount of fluidity around the shipment plan over the last couple of quarters. Clearly, this one in particular, it was a large sizable order, and those orders are slotted in -- mostly in the first half of the year.
Christopher J. Muse - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And I guess as a quick follow-up, in terms of roughly the $1 billion buyback, is that something that if you were to see weakness, you would look to be more aggressive or is that something you're still planning over the next 12 months?
Bren Higgins: Well, our plan is, as we put in the press release, was that we were going to execute that over the next 12 to 18 months. Obviously, there are conditions you would look at as you go through that period in terms of -- that would impact how you think about the timing. But that's as far as I want to go in terms of how we would execute that going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So given the order upside in the June quarter, I believe at SEMICON you said you sort of now anticipate a flattish second half versus first half, so sort of 2 questions on that front. Given your pipeline, do you still expect flattish second-half orders? And then your first half order mix was roughly 63% foundry, 23% memory, 14% logic. How do you see that mix in the second half? And can you point to specific programs or initiatives sort of dragging that order mix?
Bren Higgins: So, this is Bren. Harlan, I think that -- in consistent with what we've said at SEMICON, and we see the second half lining up roughly flat with the first half given the strength of June where we thought -- initially, we thought second half would be stronger but then we had the strength in June, which drove that view where I think it's sort of flattish now. So I don't think that that's changed. As I look at the data, I think that foundry is probably up half-on-half, memory's up half-on-half, and logic is probably lower.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then gross margin performance, Bren, as you highlighted for the June quarter, came in roughly about 110 basis points below the low end of your guidance range. I know you mentioned mix and lower revenues. Is the mix impact due to lower shipments of your high-end tools? Maybe you can just provide a bit more color there. And then for the gross margin guide for September, is that weighted more towards mix effects or just lower absorption from lower revenues?
Bren Higgins: Yes, so on the Q4 performance relative to guide, I mean, systems mix was about 1/2 of the delta there. And it was really just driven by what ends up revenue in the quarter, and that is all driven by acceptance cycles and so on. So that is how we just finished up, and it was weaker than I had expected. I think in terms of which product lines, I think there's a lot of -- always a fair amount of movement in that in terms of what actually gets accepted. The other piece of -- the other half of the margin weakness was driven by just higher-than-expected costs, parts costs in our service business, and I think it's just related to the mix of service business that we had in the quarter. So if you think about Q1, I think Q1, most of it to your point, I think, is you -- when you think about the revenue decline, I mean, as I said in the prepared remarks, we're expecting to have output going forward in excess of $800 million. So you're taking your costs associated with the ability to deliver that kind of output and spreading those across a lower revenue base, and certainly, that dilutes margin. I think the other dynamic that's in there is service is up just a little bit quarter-on-quarter. So service, which we believe is dilutive to gross margin -- it's accretive to operating margin but dilutive to gross margin as a greater percentage of the revenue mix, and that has an impact as well. So those are the dynamics that are affecting Q1.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Farhan, asking a question on behalf of John. I just wanted to probe you a little bit more in terms of the FinFET ramp. How it is progressing? The order backlog that you have already from one customer as you mentioned and what you're seeing from the other customers, where do you think the expected capacity is by end of this year and how do you see that progressing through the next year?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. This is Rick. We continue to see a lot of customer interest in FinFET development, but I think that when you get to large-scale production, we're really looking out in the foundry space in particular to see what happens in 2015. We're not as dialed in to some of the other suppliers in terms of the actual number of wafer starts. There are a lot of estimates out there. But we do see activity across several foundries in terms of FinFET. The expectation there'll be pilot -- continue to be pilot work this year and then ramping into production and high volume by the end of calendar '15.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And then my second question is on gross margins, the gross margin guidance for September quarter. If I think about the gross margins, your gross margins at that level were only way back in 2009. So I just wanted to understand like going forward after the September quarter, how should we think about gross margin? Is there some sort of a decline that has happened going forward or is it just a onetime issue?
Bren Higgins: Well, I think as I mentioned, I think how we're sized relative to the revenue levels is a factor certainly in that -- in September. I think going forward, over the long run, you always have some volatility in terms of the mix of products that we end up revenue-ing, and that has some impact on gross margin. I don't see anything fundamentally different or structural in the overall business in terms of gross margin performance. And I think you ought to continue to see us, over broad periods of time, perform fairly consistently with the gross margin model that we cited many times at 60% to 70% incremental gross margin on revenue growth. So I think given where we're starting from here, I think if mix holds the way I think it is today and obviously, that moves around a little bit, I think we'd probably end up performing towards the higher end of that range early on. But we'll have to see how it plays out. But nothing, as I said, that's sort of structural that, over broader periods of time, that would indicate that there's anything different than what we've seen in the past.
Richard P. Wallace: And this is Rick. To that point, if you look at the order book for the June quarter and you would analyze the expected margin, once those tools revenue-ed, then it's very consistent with what we've seen historically.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citigroup.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Rick, can you talk about the timing of the next phase for 3D NAND orders? If [indiscernible] on their call, they talked about the economics of 2D being better than 3D in the second half. Can you talk about what are your expectations in terms of the timing for the 3D second phase orders?
Richard P. Wallace: I think that's -- sure. I think the soonest we would see the next tranche of orders for additional capacity for 3D, the soonest would be the end of the calendar year with anticipation of early calendar '15 ramp-up. So I don't expect anything to happen before then. I think there's a lot of questions out there continuing to be addressed by our customers but when we talk to them that's the kind of timeframe we see is orders if they happen this calendar year would be at the end of the calendar year supporting buildout in '15, and I think you get to multiple suppliers -- the soonest you get to multiple suppliers is by the end of '15.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you talk about the action or the steps you're taking to combat ASML offering an on-board metrology and lithography, too, that can you talk about your historical relationship with Nikon and what you're planning to do in the future?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we don't -- I guess, certainly from our customers, there's an interest as EUV pushes out to get more capability to be able to support the multi-patterning challenges with overlay. But -- and it's not just overlay, it's all the patterning challenges. So we have been pulled, I would say, by customers to support an initiative but what we're -- we talked about is 5D, which handles several discipline aspects of the patterning challenges. And that includes allowing our customers to interface with multiple suppliers of lithography but also looking at feedforward and feedback for match as well. So we're engaged with several customers on that, trying to support their efforts to get control of the -- of their litho strategy. And I think that, that includes support with other suppliers and I think of litho in particular. And so we're working those avenues. But there's a very active engagement by customers as they deal with the challenges on multi-patterning.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Rick, I just wanted to follow up on the big $300 million order that you got from that foundry in the June quarter. Do you think the product mix from that customer will be favorable to your fiscal 2015 gross margin?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I mentioned in a response to an earlier question that if you look at the order book -- I'll be more general than specific to that one quarter, but if you take June and you look at the overall orders for June, the gross margin from that quarter looks more typical of what you would expect and what we've historically had. So rather than getting into specific margin per customers, I'll just say, overall, June looks more typical of what we've done in the past. And as Bren said, there's some anomalies in the June quarter and September that are impacting overall margins, but it does resume as he indicated back to our historical levels as you get out further into '15.
Bren Higgins: I think the other thing I would just add to that is if you look at the mix of the new products and a lot of the products that we talked about at SEMICON West with some product launches, the margin profile of the new products is on par or better than what we've seen in the past. So we feel very comfortable, I think, with the margin position of the latest products that are part of that order book but also, just in general, what we're shipping out of the factories today.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the December quarter shipments, getting back to the $800 million level. Do you think there will be DRAM shipments or capacity adds helping in that December quarter also?
Bren Higgins: We're still in excess of $800 million into December. And I think a lot of that -- I mean, there's capacity that's being shipped, I think, in general in the book for memory. But I think a lot of that depends on timing of orders. But it's certainly possible we could see some capacity shipping in the December quarter for DRAM.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I just have a couple of things. First, Bren, I don't know if you're going to answer this. But given how much the numbers are whipping around, you gave us shipments for December. I'm wondering if you can give us some sense of revenue for December and maybe margins, just given how margins are also whipping around because of some of the absorption around this big order? And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Tim, I don't want to guide out to the December quarter. I wanted to, I think, provide a little bit of color on how September is sort of setting up and some of the unique dynamics that are affecting September on the negative side and our expectations going forward. Certainly, there's a -- a portion of our revenue is going to come from shipments. So to the extent that we can deliver the shipments, 40% to 50% typically of shipments end up being revenue to the quarter. So that obviously has an impact on where we end up. But to your point, I mean, it's clearly -- in the short term, there's a little bit more volatility around the numbers. I think over the long term, given a lot of the dynamics that we talked about at SEMICON West, I think it's -- perhaps there's some moderating cyclicality, but in the short term, there can be volatility. When you have just a few customers placing orders and they're large orders and the ASPs are high, units are lower, it does have an impact. Those dynamics do have an impact quarter-on-quarter when one customer makes a decision on their plans. And I think one aspect to these plans, in terms of how people buy process control, is they tend to front-load it. And so to the extent there are challenges around progressing nodes and they're -- it obviously impacts the timing of how they add process control. And they get in the Q I think a little bit earlier for that. And as a result to that, you do see some movement when there are challenges in terms of trying to ramp new capacity. So I think those are dynamics that we're just going to have to live with. I think there are a lot of positives to it in terms of just our exposure to foundry logic. But over the long run, I think it has very little effect. And as I said, I think over time, I think it makes things a little bit more predictable in terms of how we look at it.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: And then I guess, just a big-picture question for Rick. Rick, I've been covering KLA for like 16 years and KLA never used to miss on any number. They never used to miss guidance, very predictable results, operate with a lot of backlog. And now every quarter it seems like we're guiding below or margins are whipping around a lot, yet you still have about the same amount of backlog that you've always had. So I was just wondering if you can sort of wax poetic a little bit about maybe what's different about the company today because it seems like it's becoming a lot less predictable and a lot less operating with a lot of backlog as it used to, and I'm just not sure why?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, great question. I think -- 2 thoughts, and I'll let Bren weigh in on part of this answer. It's interesting if you look back in the last 4 or 5 years. The predictability year-on-year has actually never been higher. Our ability, when we go back and look at our plans for our calendar year, our internal plans, fiscal year-on-year, it's actually pretty close to what happened. The volatility has dramatically increased on a quarter-by-quarter basis, however. And I think it speaks a little bit to what's going on in terms of fewer customers, fewer units, larger ASPs. And the backlog is partly affected by our customers not needing to take things early or not wanting to take things early but not wanting to have them late. So they want all the equipment to come in at the same time kind of to Bren's comment earlier, when they're looking at a ramp, they want to front-load it with process control. But when something moves out as it did in the September quarter, the guys that want to move in, did -- it's not a plug-and-play in terms of being able to fill in that revenue. So I think the backlog is still very solid, it's just not as fungible in terms of short term as it was. Bren, if you want to add anything to that.
Bren Higgins: So Tim, I think over the last 3 or 4 years, we've seen shipment backlog actually come in a fair amount. It used to be consistently around 6 months. And over the last few years, it's come down between 4 and 5. There is a bit of a pop in June but it's related to some long lead-time business that we booked. I think that's a little bit of an anomaly compared to what we've seen where we're generally booking in one quarter and shipping a fair amount in the next quarter. So that has changed a fair amount. And to Rick's point, it's not necessarily fungible customer-by-customer, and the timing is a factor in terms of when they need the equipment. So as a result of that, we are reacting I think much faster to the bookings number or really the shipment number, I think, in terms of where the P&L is. And so to the extent that there's predictability quarter-on-quarter in shipments, then that enables us, I think, to drive a little bit more predictability in the P&L. But it does react much faster, and in the past, we had more backlog to, I guess, absorb or cushion some of those swings, one direction or the other.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I actually wanted to follow up, Rick, on the comment you made about the timing of the customers trying to take all the tools together. The thing -- it's -- what's surprising is, I would think that to your tools, [ph] goes with the lithography tool and if I look at your guidance ASML, they guided the shipment down 20% almost in Q3 and then another down 15% in Q4, whereas you are seeing a pick-up in Q4. So where does that discrepancy coming from? I would think that foundry guys will be looking for lithography tools first, or at least lithography and process control together.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, you might imagine, we don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's happening in the litho tools space as much as dealing with our own dynamics. But a couple of thoughts for you: One, in the case of technology transition. Essentially, the world is on 193, by and large, 193 scanners now. And so there's really not a lot of change in new technology for scanners with the pushout of EUV. So may well be, they -- there's some modest changes in the scanner but they're not moving wavelengths. So they -- you don't really have necessarily technology by as much as you do and -- with some of our tools with new tools coming in. And also, if you look at memory, then in the memory case, again, the extension of litho. So we have some of the overall, probably same dynamics but I don't think it's necessarily as linked as it might have been in the past when the new litho technology isn't really that new. What we do see, too, is in the case of the order we received that we've talked about in June is the timing for that, part of the customer's goal, and we were working with them, was to secure the slots to support a RAM but also to get us in place to provide the training and resources to do all those things. In that case, they have the lithography that they need. What they were talking about is bringing in the other tool set and particularly ours because they're feeling very pressured by the yield challenges as they do 20 and sub-20 nanometers given their portfolio. So on that one, I think there's a clear difference between what we would experience in other tool providers. So I don't think it's always true that it's the same -- we're not dealing with many greenfield fabs these days. Mostly, what we're talking about is the extensions to existing capacity. In the case of greenfield, then, of course, you'd be right. You'd want to get litho tools and the other new ones, but that's not a big part of what's going on right now.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's actually very helpful. And I conclude from that, that the tools you are shipping are more newer version of your tools rather than the repeat buyers kind of thing for that 300-millimeter big orders.
Richard P. Wallace: Correct. New -- new in that customer. Not necessarily new everywhere, but new for that customer.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Right. And then one quickly on the OpEx. With the revenues going down so much, won't OpEx should be going down because your bonus allocation probably should be going down for the quarter?
Bren Higgins: Well, when we look at OpEx, I mean, the way we think about sizing the business is relative to the roadmap requirements to maintain the product investments that we need to make. And so we're less sensitive, obviously, to a quarterly change in that. And I think given our expectations of the ramp in business, we think given the -- what we feel like we need to do and our expectations of our fiscal year, but also as we look at into calendar '15, we think that's sized right. I think over time, depending on performance, you start to see variable comp move both directions. But it doesn't do that necessarily in one quarter. It all depends on what happens on sort of annual views in terms of how we pay that out. So for now, I think it's reflecting, I think, the -- some higher program investments and I expect to see those going through over the fiscal year, and I'm currently sizing the business right now around -- on an annual basis, somewhere between $925 million and $935 million for a fiscal year, and that translates into the guidance range that we gave you. Business is a lot stronger. That probably doesn't change all that much. Probably a little bit related to comp. If the business is weaker on the margin, probably doesn't change much the other direction. I think significant moves either way, obviously, will have us reacting to it, but that's how we're looking at it today.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, let me just add to that. We are starting a new fiscal year, so September is the first quarter. Obviously, we're well aware of the plans for September as we make our plan for the fiscal year. And we feel very confident about our plan for the fiscal year. And we think we'll have a very strong FY '15 for KLA-Tencor. And we're obviously aware of what that means in terms of the -- starting with the September quarter. So I think we're actually well positioned to outgrow the industry as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I just want to go back to the cash balance and buyback that I think C.J. touched on. Bren, when you made the buyback announcement at SEMICON West, I think some people were expecting more just given that if you were to execute that over 12 to 18 months, it would seem like you could cover most of it with your strong cash flow generation, and therefore, barely make a dent in the cash balance. So could we get your perspective on that and just the capital structure more broadly?
Bren Higgins: Well, certainly. As I talked about at SEMICON West, I think for a lot of the reasons that I talked about around secular dynamics, our business model, our ability to generate cash through cycle, that there's an opportunity, I think, for the company to be -- to adopt a more service capital structure as part of our long-term strategy. And so I think we've done a lot already with what we've done in terms of our dividend and the growth rate in the dividend, but there's an aspect or an opportunity to do more there. So the buyback announcement was that the sort of the recognition of that, I think the logical first step in terms of moving in that direction. I don't want to show all my cards on it, but it is something that we continue to look at additional opportunities to drive value for our shareholders by using the capital structure of the company in a more assertive way. So -- also, I think, given a lot of the dynamics I talked about, it does offer an opportunity, I think, to rely more on leverage as an opportunity to fund the company's needs, either strategic or operational down the road. And so certainly, that's an aspect of how we're thinking about it as well. So we will -- I think, on execution of the buyback, it will take our U.S. cash balance. I think, reducing the U.S. cash reserves, which is how we're going to fund that with the logical first step there, and then they'll take our U.S. cash balance because I'm not generating any new cash in the U.S. because I'm already paying it all out. We'll take it down to somewhere around $1 billion, which we think is at the right level given our views of just a strategic -- the ability to fund strategic needs and operational requirements.
Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Would you consider raising your debt levels to bring your net cash down to a level below $2 billion?
Bren Higgins: Well, I don't want to get in the specifics. I think to your point and the point I made, I think there are opportunities to -- and I think this has changed a lot in the last 12 months and I think as we look at it today, I think there are opportunities to use more leverage to drive more value over time. And I'll leave it at that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of them. Rick, I have a question. Your 2 foundry customers that are doing 14-nanometer FinFET and they have a technology tie-up. Are the DTOR[ph] or PTOR[ph] tools the same between the 2 or can they make independent decisions?
Richard P. Wallace: I'm trying to think about the confidentiality of that question. I think that, in general, our customers, the ones we deal with, are unique and able to make their own decisions.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. All right. And then just a 2-part question for Bren. On the December quarter shipments over $800 million, can you talk a little bit about what it is in the composition of the review between foundry and memory and other guys? And also did you give the June quarter order breakdown by geography?
Bren Higgins: I think the breakdown of the geography is on the web, in our supplemental information. So you can get it there. And it's -- we talked about it at SEMICON West, so it's probably not at all different from there as we finalized the quarter. I don't want to get into the mix of the shipments. We don't typically look at it that way and it all lines up based on when customer request dates are and that's how we end up driving the shipments. So I -- we think a lot about order -- incoming orders from a customer segment perspective. But to our operational guys, it's all about shipping the tool, not necessarily where it's going.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. Did you guys give a breakdown of DRAM versus NAND in June?
Bren Higgins: DRAM in June, of the memory number, which was 23%; NAND flash was 29% of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury from Summit Research.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: This is Srini Sundararajan. I have 2 questions: one positive and one negative. The first question is when you look at calendar Q3, would you see that there's a breadth of foundry orders like how you're getting foundry orders from like the 28-nanometer customers right down to 16 nanometers?
Bren Higgins: Yes, there is some breadth in the order book for foundry in September. We look generally, across the second half but in September also.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And considering that your big order that -- for like the shipments have been likely to be later, isn't it fundamentally different than whether Apple and Qualcomm go with the one set of foundries or the other? And therefore, do you have some contingency plans on what might happen if there are cancellations?
Bren Higgins: Generally, I mean if you look historically, our orders tend to shift. I mean, our cancellations in our backlog tend to be very low. I mean less than 1%, over time. So it's usually very good backlog. And obviously, the timing moves around a little bit. So I don't have any reason to believe in this case that this isn't quality backlog that will ship over the next 6 to 12 months.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we're heavily engaged with the management team and have had a lot of meetings about support. So I'm confident as well that there is -- to Bren's point, that these orders are very solid. I think one thing we have seen in the recent past as the customer has consolidated more, we do see, I think, we have pretty good visibility into people's confidence in their plans. And usually, they'll let us know if it's not going to happen. But once they place the orders, it's pretty good indication. The only exception would have been what happened during the 2009, right after the financial crisis, I'd say then, in those environments, all bets are off. But since then, I think it's been very solid.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Rick, when you were talking about outgrowing the industry back at SEMICON, outgrowing by 5%. Is that revenue-based or shipment?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we generally look over our timeframes in terms of -- ultimately, it has to be revenue. So it varies. But as you know, Mehdi, depending on the start and endpoint, you got to integrate it over time. But ultimately, if it didn't turn into revenue, it doesn't really count, right?
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Because early on, you said the year or fiscal year is very lumpy, which I understand, customer concentration. But the year has progressed in line with what you were expecting in January. But when I look at your shipment guide, even for December, even if I put in more than $800 million, it would give me calendar year shipment down 3%. So either you're saying or suggesting that WFE is going to decline by more than 5%? Or is that just an anomaly?
Richard P. Wallace: I'll let Bren take the year, but we're looking out at FY '15 press, whereas we're referring to as opposed to calendar '15, which is the next 4 quarters. But again, Bren can address calendar '14.
Bren Higgins: So when we think about calendar '14, I mean, we --- back in January, I think we were in a much more bullish view that we've moderated as we went into the April call, and I don't think that view has changed today. That we think the industry is probably plus 5% to plus 10% in that range. And so -- and when I -- and to Rick's point earlier, and just try to think about revenue performance relative to industry. This year, calendar '14, I think because of these pauses related to leading edge foundry, I think because of memory composition, I think we're setting up for this year to probably be somewhere around the market perform in calendar '14. I think as we look at calendar '15 and we -- to Rick's point earlier about our fiscal '15 given the dynamics expect about foundry and the progression of 16- and 14-nanometer ramp, we think that the company is positioned to see some of the relative outperformance that we saw in 2011, 2012 timeframe.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I'm just trying to understand the thought behind the forecasting because in January, you were saying that foundry is going to be weak, but then 3D NAND is going to be very strong. And back then, you were saying that June quarter, you should be able to do around $750 million, $800 million of shipment. That has entirely changed. And now you're saying there's a big turn coming in December. So I'm just wondering what gives the confidence that these turns or these pauses don't change or is -- are you -- are we setting ourselves up for more disappointment down the road?
Bren Higgins: Well, I mean -- and we talked about it a lot over the last 6 months about just, I think, the challenges our customers have been facing in trying to ramp some of these new technologies, in the memory side with V-NAND, I think there were expectations in the industry. It's certainly a much stronger investment in V-NAND and certainly, I think that has pushed out into '15. Certainly, the next phase of that. We talked about a lot about foundry push. I think, given what we're seeing in the order book now, it seems that we're starting to see these commitments in the industry towards putting production in place to start to ramp this capability for FinFET into the middle of next year. And that would line up with timing of shipments in the fourth quarter, calendar quarter and into the March quarter to be able to have that capability come on line. But these have been very challenging transitions for our customers and they've all, I think, crossed whether it's memory or even in foundry. We've seen a slowdown there that has continued through the middle of the year. It looks like it's going to be -- it's turning the corner now, but I think it's been a tough transition.
Richard P. Wallace: And Mehdi, to your point, and you've made this point in the past as I recall, our inability to forecast short term. It is -- I made the comment earlier on the call. It is interesting, when I look back, we actually have done -- certainly, internally when we plan out the year, we've actually done a pretty good job of forecasting on an annualized basis. But what is interesting also is it's usually not exactly how we thought it would happen. So if I look at the fiscal year that just ended, our booking's target for the year and what we ended up achieving internally is very close to what we have modeled and process control intensity was very close, and we actually had some strength in share. But when you go back and look at the specific customers in the mix, it wasn't necessarily at all what we thought. So it came from different regions, it came from different customers, it came from different -- sometimes even different products. So I would say, we're better over the longer term and more on an annualized basis than we are on a quarterly basis. And even to your point, things move and have moved quite a bit during this calendar year. And to your point, it's pretty likely that they'll move again based on this history. So we're -- we pointed out at SEMICON West, it's very hard for us to predict WFE, so we base our business on what we think in terms of share and adoption and how we can drive process control intensity and try to be flexible to handle the normal gyrations we see in the customer base. But we have consistently proven your point, we're not great at forecasting certainly over a 3-month period.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Rick, maybe first, a big kind of picture question on the reticle inspection business as a whole. We've seen a pickup in orders in recent quarters. But do you see any big structural changes in that business itself given that you are at much higher run rates coming out of the market correction in 2010 and '11 but we've kind of seen it really muted for the last, I would say, 3 years. Are there big changes coming around? Or do you see maybe a more sustained pickup as we enter 2015?
Richard P. Wallace: Patrick, great question. I would say the following: One, the biggest inflection that would come for reticle inspection would, of course, be EUV and high volume. And we said at SEMICON West and continue to say, we don't see that happening in the foreseeable future. However, we are seeing indication that a sub-20 nanometer, some of the lithography challenges being presented by people having to extend 193 is creating a buying cycle both in -- and certainly, in mask shop, it's not as robust as it would be if it were an entirely new generation of mask. But I think that what we don't know and our customers don't know is how much capacity they're going to need to add. And part of that is how many starts are going to actually happen in the sub-20. But we have seen some support for that. The other thing that goes on is in the fab line. And I think that the customers have enjoyed a holiday, a mask makers holiday, if you will, because of the double patterning on relatively simple mask. But again, when you get to sub-20, there's some challenges associated with that. That business is different, we have different offerings for it, that tends to be more cost competitive and not as high tech. And so there's some challenges in terms of satisfying, and there's more competitive pressure in that market. But we have offerings, and we think we can compete in that market. But it's not going to be as the same as what you've seen in the mask shop. So until high volume, EUV comes in, which is several years out, I do think there's going to be some opportunity as we look at sub-20 and some of the lithography challenges. But frankly, it's new enough that our customers don't yet know exactly the implications for their reticle strategy.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division: Great. And my follow-up question on the wafer inspection business. You've seen a pickup, and you talked about the record orders this year. You've also mentioned that DRAM spending was up. I think in the past, you've noted that you expect the process control intensity for DRAM to be kind of split between metrology and inspection. I guess, after the last few quarters with DRAM spending has been up, are you seeing more of a bias towards inspection given that metrology is trying to hold steady? Or is that something where metrology will catch up down the line with, I guess, the capacity build on the DRAM side?
Bren Higgins: Great question. I think that the immediate answer is right now, we're seeing probably a little more opportunity in the wafer inspection. But the truth is, there's not enough out there yet at the advanced nodes and DRAM or frankly and what's going on in flash, for our customers to fully appreciate what they're going to need. We've talked about our process control intensity going up. But if you look at -- for example, our 3D NAND model, part of the reality is there hasn't been enough out there to really validate the model yet. But I would say if there's any bias, it would be towards higher levels of adoption and probably more in the inspection side. The caveat being is if in the -- our ability in OCD, in optical CD, to take on more some of the historical SEM-based inspections, I think that does provide some opportunity particularly as people go to more 3D structures then there's probably more growth in that segment. So still early to tell, but I think, right now, to answer your question, I'd say the bias might be a little more towards inspection.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Rick, I'm just wondering what your view is for calendar '15. Do you see any pull-in for -- potentially for 10-nanometer of foundry spending? And if so, do you have any view whether EUV will be used on 10-nanometer?
Richard P. Wallace: We do see some interest in 10-nanometer. In fact, there's -- I don't know, I probably couldn't explain [ph] but there's certainly been customers talking about accelerating 10-nanometer development and very aggressively. And I think, there's a bit of a competitive battle going on in the foundry space to get to the next node. My expectation is that we'll not see high-volume EUV for 10-nanometer, but because there is some capacity out there, I think it only stands to reason that if people want to use 10-nanometer, want to use EUV in 7-nanometer production, they're going to definitely try to get it into 1 layer or 2 for 10-nanometer just to debug it and prove it out. But I think on -- at the same time, customers I talked to about 10-nanometer have -- that is a nice-to-have, not a must-have, to be able to do 10-nanometer. They're certainly going to be capable of doing 10-nanometer without it because they feel like there's some challenges with the productivity in 10-nanometer. But of course, the -- especially those that have some capacity would like to get some learning out of it and some productivity out of it.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Got it. And on the second half order outlook, you said that memory would be up half-over-half. Do you think that's weighted more toward DRAM or NAND?
Richard P. Wallace: I think in September, right now it looks like it's -- NAND is a higher percentage. We're -- right now, for September, we're forecasting memory overall to be about 27% of the mix or so, 27%, 28%. And NAND will be the bulk of that. I think there is -- but there is investment in both areas. And so -- I just don't have the detail on December but that outlook is for September right now.
Operator: I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace:  Thanks Ed. I will begin with an overview of the key developments during the quarter followed by our perspective on the current demand picture and the industry CapEx outlook for 2014 and then guidance for the June quarter. I will then turn the call over to Bren for his financial commentary.  KLA-Tencor delivered another solid quarter in Q3 FY 2014 benefiting from our market leadership and solid operational execution. Revenue in Q3 was in the upper half of guidance at $832 million. Gross margin was 59% at the upper end of the guided range and earnings per share also finished above the range of guidance at a $1.23 per share. KLA-Tencor strategic objectives are focused on achieving superior long term growth and market leadership while delivering sustained operational excellence with the ultimate goal of delivering industry leading products to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders. Our financial results for Q3 demonstrate continued strong execution against these strategic objectives. Now for some perspective on the current demand environment, new orders for March was $702 million finishing at the low end of the guided range for the quarter as bookings from foundry and logic customers fell below their original forecast for the quarter. KLA-Tencor bookings result in Q3 is consistent with the widely reported slowdown in leading edge logic demand seen in the industry today as customers have delayed plans for additional production capacity for 20-nanometers following a strong initial ramp. In the significant yield challenges the market leaders have encountered an early development of the 16, 14 and 10-nanometer nodes have created uncertainty over timing of these transitions in calendar year 2014. For KLA-Tencor our market leadership and growth are driven through successful collaboration with our customers. Our mission was to help our customers navigate the ever changing landscape of increasing device complexity and yield challenges that accompany each major node transition.  Now in logic and foundry with the introduction of the new 3D gate architectures, the yield issues our customers are grappling with today are proving to be the most challenging that the industry has ever faced and even the smallest variation in process margin can cause significant yield losses for these devices. Some of these issues with these process margin people are dealing with are CD dimensional changes, [spin height] [ph] control, process challenges such as difficulty in optimizing implant recipes, and then there are unique defect issues associated with new CMP steps, new etch steps that are all part of the FinFET process and that’s just a small sampling of the complex technical challenge that is associated with bringing new 3D device architectures to market. So as the market leader in process control we’re working closely with our customers to resolve these issues but there is a steep learning curve and there is questions over the timing and resolutions of these yield issues and that has resulted in uncertainty and delaying plans for the ramping of FinFET technology and an uncertainty associated with the resumption of these programs. Now in memory the market leaders continue to demonstrate a commitment to pushing CapEx investment in both DRAM and NAND. However they are also facing similar challenges to logic when they deal with their leading edge complexity and Phase I of new the China NAND fab but there is uncertainty over the timing of follow on production for 3D NAND and there is an expected volume of planar NAND capacity for the industry that’s clouding near term forecast. Finally in DRAM customers are continuing their steady pace of investment in technology transitions in 2014 with the market leader currently ramping 20-nanometer conversion and various other conversion projects are underway as major players continue to invest in this market. However we think these projects are sufficient to meet the bit supply requirements for 2014. So turning now to our industry outlook for the remainder of 2014. It's clear from our discussions with customers that despite near term slowdown in demand their intentions are continue to execute the strategies for growth at the leading edge and invest at high level to achieve and advance their competitive roadmaps. It's also clear that issues related to leading edge device yields and high concentration of demand across the consolidated customer base and uncertainty over the timing of follow on capacities have introduced a degree of variability into our quarterly demand forecast and have made visibility into our customer production plans extremely challenging today. While we acknowledge it's still early in the year, but given all the challenges forecast and the challenges associated with looking out through the rest of the year, we’re adopting a slightly more conservative yield of CapEx for 2014 and we’re now modeling industry growth at about 5% for the year. With the upside hinging on order momentum resuming across a broader base of customers in sub-20 nanometer foundry and in 3D NAND. The rapid advance in chip complexity brings enormous challenges to leading edge chip designers and it fuels the growth for KLA-Tencor and although the cost complexity and time to market pressures of technology changes have always been a driver for process control market adoption, the transition to 3D structures and the introduction of the new multi-patterning techniques is a significant change in terms of device cost and complexity and it's proving to be extremely challenging for all of our customers. So in this environment the long term outlook for process control continues to be very favorable and as advance process control solutions are going to be essential for our customer’s success now and well into the future. So this obviously plays to our strength as a market leader in process control. So in conclusion we’re pleased with the results of the quarter but we’re adopting a more cautious approach in the near term outlook. We remain focused on continuing our market leadership and optimizing value for our shareholders in 2014 and beyond. Now turning to guidance for the June quarter, bookings are expected to be in the range of $625 million to $825 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $700 million and $760 million with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.75 to $0.95 per share. With that I will turn the call over to Bren.
Bren Higgins:  Thanks Rick and good afternoon everyone. My remarks today will focus on highlights of the financial results for Q3 and my perspective on current trends in the marketplace and our business model. As Ed previously noted beginning this quarter we will post a slide presentation with additional financial data and key operating metrics to supplement my commentary. You will find this information posted along with our press release in Investor Relations section of the KLA-Tencor website.  Now on to the results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014, revenue for Q3 was 832 million, 12 million above the mid-point of the range of guidance and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were a $1.21, non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter above the guided range at $1.23 per share applying effective tax rate of 19% resulting from a number of factors including a higher mix of off-shore income and a release of certain tax reserves. Non-GAAP earnings would have been a $1.17 or $0.07 above the mid-point of guidance at our modeled non-GAAP tax rate of 23%. In our press release and in our supplemental financial data accompanying our results, you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference in EPS. My comments in the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. New orders in Q3 were 702 million, finishing at the low end of the guided bookings range for quarter. As Rick mentioned we’re currently experiencing a slowdown in leading edge demand. We’re encouraged the adoption by customers of our high-end inspection of metrology products in navigating these significant process transitions. As in fact today we’re positioned to achieve record bookings for both our wafer inspection and thin film critical dimension products for the full year in fiscal year 2014 therefore we believe the weakening demand in both the foundry and the logic segments is a near term episode for their current expectation for stronger order momentum to resume in the second half of the calendar year. Turning now to our customer segment commentary for the March quarter. Foundry demand is 56% of new orders for Q3 consistent with our expectations as a percentage of the overall mix of orders, the lower in terms of absolute dollars compared with December and original forecast. Foundry orders were weaker than expected in Q3 as one large customer scale back demand for 20-nanometer investment and another customer delay leading edge capacity plans. We believe the near term foundry push outs are largely a timing issue of 20-nanometers as well as at sub20 nanometer node transition where our customers are grappling the significant yield issues from process and maturity in the early stages of 3D device development. We expect to see foundry order growth in the second half of calendar ’14 with strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving demand. Memory was 23% of new system orders in March and down sequentially in absolute dollars from the prior quarter as expected. We believe activity to support Phase I of the new China based NAND project is now largely complete. All systems shipped by KLA-Tencor installed and are currently being used in production. Memory customer investment remains focused on 3D technology development and new capacity in NAND and technology upgrades in DRAM. We have seen memory orders increasing in the second half of 2014 with the timing of tool deliveries for Phase II of the China NAND project to swing factor in the period. Logic was 21% of new orders in-line with the original forecast. Investment by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 63% of the orders we received in the March quarter. Turning now to the distribution of orders by product group, wafer inspection was approximately 46%, Reticle inspection was approximately 13%. Metrology was approximately 15% of new orders and service was approximately 23%. Storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 3%. Total shipments in the quarter were 731 million and below the mid-point of a guided range of 720 million to 780 million for the quarter as delivery timing for some order shifted in the June quarter. Push outs of customer delivery requirements from the first half into the second half of 2014 related to sub20 nanometer projects in leading edge foundry and delays in NAND capacity editions have contributed to a lower than expected shipment profile over the next six months. June quarter shipments are expected to be in the range of 700 million to 760 million  In total we ended the quarter with just over 1.1 billion of total backlog comprised of 787 million of shipment backlog, orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next six months and 308 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was 832 million up 18% sequentially and in-line with guidance. Revenue growth in March reflect strong customer acceptance of new products. Gross margin was 59% down 80 basis points compared with the December quarter but at the upper end of guidance largely due to lower installation, warranty and retrofit cost in these originally modeled in January. Product mix was in-line with expectations. Incremental gross margins were 55%, slightly better than what was modeled for the quarter. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 57% to 58% in the June quarter due to lower revenue volume and flat factory output. Total operating expenses were 226 million down slightly from December quarter and in-line with the guidance range of 225 million to 230 million. We’re continuing to size the company’s quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range and expect it to remain in this range for the next few quarters. The timing of product development investments will lead to some fluctuation within this range quarter-to-quarter. Tax rate was 19% in the quarter below the 23% planning rate. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share would have been a $1.17. Going forward you should continue to use the long term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Finally net income is 206 million or a $1.23 for fully diluted share.  I will turn now to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement, cash and investments into the quarter just over 3 billion an increase of 76 million versus the December quarter. Cash from operations was 238 million in the quarter up a 123 million sequentially and free cash flow was 220 million. In the quarter we paid a dividend of 75 million and repurchased 60 million of stock in an average price of $64.41. As of March 31, we had approximately 3 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over a 168 million and are expected to remain roughly flat for the June quarter. Finally although the equipment industry is currently experiencing a near term reduced level of demand with uncertainty over the timing of orders the long term drivers for growth remained strong as we expect yield challenges associated with multi-patterning and FinFET to drive investments and process control by foundry and logic customers and with our memory customers demonstrating a strong appetite for investment in 3D NAND CapEx and 20 nanometer DRAM. We remain focused on executing our long term strategies and enabling our customer success in an increasingly more complex industry and technical environment. With that to reiterate our guidance for the quarter as bookings are expected to be within a range of 625 million to 825 million, revenue between 700 million and 760 million. EPS of $0.75 to $0.95 per share. This concludes our remarks on the quarter and I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with ISI Group. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: I guess first question, you guys are kind of in the catbird seat in terms of the issues that your key customers are facing and I’m intrigued by your commentary about an expectation for recovery in the second half. So curious given the work that you do on yield excursions, how you’re helping your customer solve these problems? What’s giving you that confidence that we will indeed see recovery either Q3, Q4?
Rick Wallace:
 :
Bren Higgins: Yes so C.J. I think that as we look at, we look out right now I mean certainly over the course of the last part of the March quarter we did see a fair amount of churn with our customers in terms of capacity planning, really driven by some of the challenges associated with these technology transitions both in NAND and the foundry in logic side. So I think as we have worked through these plans and started to think about factory loading in terms of delivery dates and so on I think we feel like we will be able to make some progress on this and we will see some recovery in the order momentum, certainly around foundry and logic in the second half of the year. I think one of the sort of the upside factors in that relative to our more conservative outlook is that we would see broader based participation in sub-20 nanometer work in the second half of the year and I think if we see broader participation beyond the leaders then that could be something that could be a swing factor, we look at the second half of the year but right now as we look at it second half looks like it's probably up somewhere between 10% and 15% from an order perspective versus the first half of the year but we will have to see what it looks like when we get there, though as I said there has been fair amount of noise over the last month or so. So it certainly has us operating a little bit more cautiously as we look at this.
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: If I could ask a quick follow-up, now that we’re a bit into the vertical NAND movement I’m curious if there is sort of any update on your thoughts around process control intensity whether we’re in fact seeing that kind of 180 bps kind of increase and where you’re seeing that within your business? 
Rick Wallace: We do see a lot of interest but I think it's still very early in the 3D NAND and there are some serious concerns about getting yielding processes that are economical from the manufacturer. So I think this is a case where there has been a bet on technology, it's not yet proven in terms of -- the leader or the people that are behind them that it's technically viable on an economic basis. So that you can get both the yield and the performance you need to make it make sense. So we actually see some degree of pause around that and that’s why I think that when Bren gets to the forecast for the year part of the swing factor is what happens late in the year based on what has happened early in the year. So there is some struggle, we do see more intensity but there are definitely some concerns about just getting the overall process to perform as expected from a yield perspective. Does that make sense C.J.?
C.J. Muse - ISI Group: It does.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Saqib Jalil - JPMorgan: This is Saqib Jalil on behalf of Harlan Sur. Last call you mentioned some weakness or slight delays in 28 nanometer [turnaround] [ph] capacity at foundry customers. We have heard 28 nanometer starting to pick up meaningfully for shipment in second half of this year. Are you guys anticipating that some of the foundry order activity near term is 28 nanometer driven or is it all 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer [inaudible]?
Bren Higgins: We did see some pickup in activity round 28, it was minimal. I mean one thing about a maturing node is, is we tend to see less process control intensity as the node matures and so we did see some activity there, we were kind of waiting for that for the last quarter or so and it wasn’t as much as we expected but we did see some there but I think as we look forward I see at least over the course of this year probably somewhere between 60% and 70% and what I expect to see in the foundry to be 16-14 centric. So very little 28, although there is probably going to be some but most of it is focused on 16-14 through the rest of the calendar year.
Saqib Jalil - JPMorgan: And a quick follow-up, any updates on the large inspection for 10 nanometer development that pushed out to first half of calendar 2014? Shall we still expect revenues related to them in 2015 timeframe?
Rick Wallace: Yes, there is no change really in that plan. We actually ended up booking two of those systems in the March quarter and booked the third system about a week ago. So those are in backlog now but they won't ship until the early part of 2015. So that’s put a little bit of pressure on revenue through the second half of the year because that’s backlog that’s going to sit for a little while but given the customer we think it's very solid backlog and very consistent with our agreement with them in terms of lead time. So we expect those tools to ship in the early part of 2015.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad- Credit Suisse:  This Farhan asking a question on behalf of John. I just wanted to understand what are your expectation in terms of the mix for bookings in the June quarter, which A, as you expect the bookings to come from with regards to foundry versus logic versus memory?
Rick Wallace: Right. Here let me take a look at that for you, so looks like foundry is about 71% of June quarter, logic is 13% and memory 15% and of the memory mix 37% of that is NAND Flash. So back to after three fairly significant quarters from June through December of memory business we’re seeing something more similar to this 70-ish, 30-ish mix that going forward through here into 2014. 
Farhan Ahmad- Credit Suisse: And in terms of the memory like it seems to be a pretty significant drop in your order intake and I just want to understand like how much is inspection specific and how much is industry specific?
Bren Higgins: Well I think around the -- I mean certainly NAND flash weakness was something I think that was probably more industry specific. I mean from a DRAM perspective we expected memory to be down in the quarter and it was relatively consistent with our expectations I think around some of the conversion activity. Our level of participation given the lower process control intensity on memory was lower and so with that level of activity out there, there was a piece of that we obviously didn’t participate in. So it was about in-line with what we were thinking through the March quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim Arcuri with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Co: Bren can you sort of -- last quarter I asked you the same question but given that the shipment guidance for June is like 100 million lower than what we thought it would be maybe three or so months ago, can you maybe hold our hand on what September quarter shipment number is going to be relative to the June number?
Bren Higgins: Yes so the shipment number I mean primarily it's lower because the bookings number, the midpoint of bookings was about 800 but came in at 700. So there was a lot of, there were some orders that we are expecting to ship that didn’t materialize. So in fact then we thought that shipments would be in excess of 800 and it's where we’re now at this 730 midpoint. As I said in the prepared comments, I think as we continue here I think September is flattish so without guiding it, as I look at it now given the expectations around bookings in the June quarter and how those will flow through in terms of impacting our shipments in September. I see sort of a flattish profile over the next six months if you will with picking back up in the December quarter.
Tim Arcuri - Cowen & Co: There was another one of your peers not in competition with you but in another company in your space that reported last night that has results that are significantly different than yours and it seems like they are being really uniquely helped by some of the multi-pass steps in DRAM and I’m wondering if there is any sort of perspectives, benefits that you might get from the explosion and multi-pass steps in DRAM as you down to 20 nanometer. Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Well we definitely see an increased intensity in memory as you scale and we have laid that out at SEMICON West and we’re continuing to see that trend play out. So we do see increased intensity both in memory either NAND or DRAM as we scale. So we have seen that that continues to hold and the investment continuing we will continue to see that kind of penetration off of our growth but as we said before overall the intensity in memory is lower for process control than there is in foundry or logic.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.
Romit Shah - Nomura: I wanted to ask you about the Samsung GlobalFoundries partnership, it seems like in the past you know the foundry space has become very competitive leading to multiple pilot line project but recently we’re seeing evidence of collaboration and I wanted to understand from your perspective how that might impact just the total investment for FinFET looking out over the next 1 to 2 years. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: I think kind of (indiscernible) as kind of two functions from my perspective, one is it is a counter balance to the increase in cost of development that everybody is dealing with which is why of course people are driving that direction. The other thing that it certainly has done is created a much more rational market if you will in terms of guiding demand. So you’ve a customers are more careful and you don’t have multiple lines competing for the same business, so the other side of it would be if you had multiple players at FinFET all competing for the same end customer user business than what you result in as you do a lot of development and you built some tabs [ph] but you can’t fill them. So those rationalization actually I think makes the business more predictable over the long term and as a natural consequence is increase in complexity and cost. So from a planning perspective you generally favor it, what it does mean is you won't see as many spikes in demand but as we know from the past those are often meant by crashes once the capacity gets online and there is not a market for it. So overall I think it's the reality, I think that it's not a surprise. The increasing intensity of the process control makes a lot of opportunities for us and I just think what it does it reduce the volatility but in the end it's probably the same aggregate investment, it's rationalize over time.
Romit Shah - Nomura: Do you expect to see more collaboration as well?
Rick Wallace: Well I think you’re down almost, you’re not quite to a prime number of players but you’re getting close. I mean they aren’t that many people left who are advanced development on 1x design and I think that as you go forward you are pretty much down to handful and in both memory and in logic and I don’t think there is a lot more room for consolidation of prospects. There are industry consortiums where people do pretty competitive work that have been going on for a while to provide some very front end but still when it comes to process integration I think you’re down to just a handful at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: I was just wondering if maybe we could look ahead into 2015 if somehow yields get back on track for FinFET and 3D NAND and we do end up with maybe a 5% up CapEx year like you’re predicting, what you think demand could grow in 2015, what kind of a percentage increase do you think could happen?
Bren Higgins: I don’t know if we want to, we can size it I mean I think when you think about these transitions and how compelling they are I think from an end market perspective I think that some of the noise around how big 2014 is some of these rather significant projects actually start to shift into next year. So I think the way we’re looking at is given the strength of these transitions, I think the commitment from our customers towards them from the leading customers to the secondary customers I think everyone is very focused I think on investing to stay competitive in the business. So I think we think we have got a year or couples of years of CapEx growth in front of us but sizing it that I have hard enough time with June let alone thinking about 2015 but I think in terms of how we’re sizing the company and how we’re running the company is that we do expect the kind of business levels we’re seeing now and holding as we sort of move through into ’15. So operating in this $700 million - $800 million range, doesn’t mean you won't have some quarter-to-quarter volatility in there but generally operating in that level and I haven't seen anything to make me think otherwise at this point.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities: And just real quickly, can you also give us an idea on 3D NAND activity in terms of the number of companies you see working on that fan out, has it broaden out to all four being sort of actively I guess more than actively engaged not just really doing development work but maybe looking to add pilot lines.
Rick Wallace: I would say at this point no. I would think momentum since our last call has cooled on 3D NAND, you still obviously have a leader in it but I think the other players are in development but I would say right now it's kind of slowdown in terms of active plans to drive to production and we’re not forecasting it in this calendar year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Summit Research. Your line is open.
Srini Sundararajan - Summit Research : I just have only one question, do you expect any 10 nanometer orders this year?
Rick Wallace: Yes, some of our forecast is baked into the second half of the year, has some early development work around 10 nanometer beyond what we have already booked on the mass inspection side. So again I think it's part of the second half thesis but obviously it's I think dependent on how progression through the current node focus and as we get to 10 nanometer we will see if that schedule holds but right now we do have some activity forecasted for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group: Rick the first one for you, I’m looking at your shipment over the past several years, overall shipment has averaged around $3 billion and it seems to me we’re in this perpetual pause mode where we have a strong one or two a strong quarterly booking, and then things phase out and some may refer it to as a pause and to that extend my question to you is what is the confidence that all of these inflection points in technology like a 3D NAND and FinFET is going to materialize and would lead to growth in shipment. What is it's all it's spread over multiyear period and it will be more of a gradual. I hope you understood my question.
Rick Wallace : Well I think the -- yes let me just back it up and restate it and what gives us confidence that we’re going to outgrow WFE as a percent? Is that really the question?
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group: Yes and also with the caveat that we have averaged 3 billion of shipment over the past three years. We have had 1 or 2 quarters of strong momentum and then things slows down and we have these perpetual pause mode that we have every year. What gives you confidence that next year will be any different?
Rick Wallace: Well I will actually turn it back to Bren because he has got the specific numbers but for example for calendar ’14 when we modeled this year it depends on where you think WFE lands in terms of overall but we do expect to outperform the market for the year and Bren maybe you can walk through the numbers there.
Bren Higgins: Well Mehdi, I think it is clear and if you go look from our FY ’11 through FY ’14, they were almost finished with year [ph] that we have been operating between 2.8 billion and 3.2 billion of revenue and so clearly from a historical perspective that is unique. I mean I think it's one of the issues as why we think the industry driven by the end markets has changed fundamentally that we don’t have the cyclicality that we used to have and you can have quarter-to-quarter volatility with even some debts because of customer consolidation if one customer turns on or off but at the end of the day it's still relatively less cyclical and frankly maybe a little bit more predictable over the long run. I mean I think it has changed and I think as we look at -- I think there are inflection points in the industry that can drive I think some growth but I think over, you know the area under the curve is much larger too right? Because you don’t have the volatility so you’re generating more aggregate revenue through a cycle and more aggregate obviously earnings and cash flow. So yes it's different and I think makes you know the quarter-to-quarter changes less relevant in terms of an indicator of something more broadly cyclical but I think overtime I think we can run the business more efficiently, we can generate more aggregate cash flow with less volatility. But the inflections will provide some opportunities for some relative revenue growth as well.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group: So let’s say in a scenario where your shipment were to average 3 billion for a few more years, would there be any expense to the operating model to be able to adjust to it given where your margins are?
Bren Higgins: Well I think you know we’re operating with our operating model that we have had historically here so. I mean I think the challenge obviously in that scenario would be how do you improve your productivity and find cost offsets to maintain your spend levels in a consistent way. I mean overtime I think we have done a pretty good job with that certainly of inflections around program spending as you’re bringing new product to market. But in general I think it's what we have been doing historically but I think we just have to look for those opportunities and keep our focus operationally, just continue to deliver the kinds of operating margins that we have over the years.
Rick Wallace : But to your point let’s assume that there was an ongoing the market stayed flat, WFE stayed flat, the percent of process control stayed flat or went up slightly and we held market share. Then what you will be left with is growth in services which are actually continue to grow overtime but we don’t anticipate it will be flat, we think there are opportunities for process control that continue to increase as a percent but it's, we don’t see it doubling, it's not going to go from 15% to 30% but based on what we have seen overtime we do see some opportunities for that to drive growth and then you also get growth in services and as Bren says, our operational efficiency keeps improving over time as we drive the revenue with pretty effective utilization of our resources.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: You had a pretty good year of memory over this last year. If my calculation is correct, your orders were up 100% and you’re back down to probably 2000 level run-rate. So I’m assuming when you talk about the second half pick up you’re expecting most of that coming from foundry and none from memory, probably more sluggish or down in the second half?
Bren Higgins: No Mahesh, it's Bren, so we’re expecting obviously some recovery from foundry and logic but we’re expecting memory to improve in the second half as well. I think right now it seems later in the second half and as I said earlier I think that’s one of the swing factors in terms of actual CapEx or WFE growth in calendar ’14. You know as you think about the next phase of capacity adds, at the China NAND flash fab I mean right now we’re planning for those orders late in the year. If those were to pull in and those tools were to ship into revenue in December certainly that would have an impact on the WFE number. So right now I plan for those for some of those shipments out in early 2015 but I think as we have seen even over the last couple of months that our customers can be fairly fluid in terms of their plan. So we will see how that plays out but I expect a higher percentage of memory in the second half than we have in the first half.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: And second question on the 2016, is it your opinion that 20 nanometer is completely billed out and the inflection you are waiting for is more 16 – 14 from three customers you’ve I suppose that are the three probably three customers on the foundry side. Is that the right way to think about?
Bren Higgins: I have to take to talk specifically about 20 given that it's a relatively very small number of people than (indiscernible). But I think that it is true mostly the investment we’re anticipating for the rest of the year is coming at sub20 nanometer investment on the memory and on the logic and foundry side. So that is true but that is the bulk of the investment we’re anticipating for the rest of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Rick I know this very hypothetical but looking out to the 16 and 14 nanometer ramp next year, at 28 you guys benefited from a lot of the yield issues that the customer initially had where you saw additional process control capacity buys. Given the significant challenges you mentioned with FinFET, could you see a repeat of that type of scenario when 16 and 14 go into high volume manufacturing.
Rick Wallace: Yes, let me explain how the dynamic works because we have seen this moving [ph] before. When people start with a new node usually there is a fair amount of investment in the front end including in process control but if they are struggling to get yield then it's a pause because there is no point in pouring a lot more investment in if the process isn't performing and if the process isn't performing as people expect, the costs aren’t there, there aren’t enough designs behind the customers so there is this natural pause but then they restart and when they restart and when they start getting more confidence you start bringing in more customers, then you hit another set of yield problems. So I would characterize it in three phases of yield challenges, you have the developmental challenges where we participate. In fact certain of our tool sets go in more of that phase and we have seen that penetration. Then in the ramp which is can be depending on the complexity of the node can be sometime later because they have to work out a bunch of issues, not all or in many cases not many of them may not be related to what our tools can help with. But in ramp then there is a huge opportunity. Ramp is arguably the biggest opportunity for process control is during the ramp phase. Then in high volume it's more about securing the gains that people have made and that’s when the mix like in 28 and second half of last year moves towards some of the lower cost tools. So right now I would say we’re not completely done with development depending on which customers you’re talking about and we’re ways away from ramp. And when that ramp hits, I expect there will be plenty of opportunities. Does that make sense?
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:
 :
Bren Higgins: Well I think it's right now I would say it's biased towards V-NAND but I think one of the things that I think to Rick’s point earlier I think depending on progress around improving yield reliability and cost around that node that you could see some of the bit growth get met by expanding NAND or planar capacity to support that but right now I’m thinking about it in terms of V-NAND but it certainly could change and I think there has been a fair amount of information publically recently that there are some challenges there including what Rick just talked about.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: So follow-up to Patrick’s question, should the industry continue to face issue the V-NAND and some of your customer decide to spend a little more planar than rather V-NAND. how does the process of control intensity affect you with decent [ph] margin?
Rick Wallace: It's too soon to really say, I mean it depends on if they are scaling, how much they are scaling a planar. If they are not scaling then it doesn’t really, you know you go back the intensity but if they are scaling the planar there is a lot of opportunity there. The challenge has been with scaling planar is some of the technologies associated with that. There is less process control in margin in there and so you need more process control but the truth is we’re very early in the 3D NAND to know exactly what process control intensity is going to be until somebody has gone through a real ramp of it and arguably you would say more than one player because the characteristics are usually different for different players ramping. So I would say it's early but our model say that they are not that different if they are similar kind of performance expectation and device. They are different technologies but the intensity is probably pretty comparable.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: And then you had talked a little bit about some of the shipments (indiscernible) back half as a result of this pause right? Have you seen more competitive pressure as a result of that? Has your competitor take advantage of the fact that business is slower and they try to get into a customer and say, hey qualify my queue instead because now the customer has more time to do that?
Rick Wallace: No I haven't seen any change in the competitive environment over there. I mean there is always a push by customers to get the most value that they can for their investment but if anything the thing that’s driving some of the pause is related to solving very hard problems and if anything we’re seeing more push on us providing more support and capability to our debugging some of these processes. So while I haven't seen a change negatively I would argue that we’re in some cases being relied on more heavily to debug.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Lockwood I will turn the call back over to you.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you Jamie. And I would like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team for joining us here today. An audio replay of today’s call will be available on this website later this afternoon and again we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Candace, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ted Lockwood: Thank you, Candace. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. KLA-Tencor executed well in the second quarter of fiscal year 2014, delivering revenue and EPS in the upper half of the range of guidance and shipments above the top end of the range, and demonstrating market leadership and strong execution across our worldwide operations. New orders were below the range in Q2. As previously indicated, in Q2, a customer delayed a large order for mask inspection tools earmarked for 10-nanometer development. We currently expect that order to book in the first half of calendar year 2014. Regarding our customer focus and growth objectives, as the market leader on process control, our success is dictated by ongoing productive collaboration with customers, and continuing to innovate and execute so we can bring new products to market. KLA-Tencor advanced our leadership in the December quarter, winning key customer engagements in each of our major end markets. Process control is continuing to play a critical role in enabling the major technology inflections underway at the leading edge, as well as helping customers solve their most complex yield challenges. Customer highlights in Q2 included adoption of our latest generation broadband plasma inspectors by customers for 14-nanometer pilot programs in foundry and in memory for both 3D NAND and 2X nanometer DRAM projects. KLA-Tencor's broadband plasma inspection platform leads the optical inspection marketplace today in terms of capability and cost of ownership. In laser scattering wafer inspection, KLA-Tencor extended our leadership in mine monitoring applications in Q2, achieving a significant advantage in head-to-head competition in the quarter, both in terms of dollar and unit share. Q2 also marked a record for quarterly bookings in our fill measurement and optical CD division. KLA-Tencor's specter shape metrology solution is critical and a successful ramp of leading edge logic and memory devices with complex 3-dimensional shapes, such as FinFET and vertically stacked NAND. Metrology is playing an increasing critical role in the success of our customers' technology roadmaps, as they move beyond traditional scaling in the incorporation of new materials and advanced structures at the leading edge. Overall, in spite of the bookings data, the December quarter yielded good results for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating the strength of our market leadership, our superior business model and successful execution by our worldwide team. Now for some perspective on the current industry environment. End demand for our wafer fab equipment continues to be driven by mobility markets and a high level of investment in customer activity at the leading edge. Today, the market leaders are engaged in an all-out race to leverage their scale and technology advantages to gain a competitive advantage. For 2014, our outlook is for a continuation of this multi-year investment cycle, with the aggregate semiconductor industry CapEx expected to grow at approximately 10% for the year. As is typical, we can expect the quarterly spending levels supporting these technology transpositions to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, as our customers address their yield challenges and adjust their capacity plans and outlook throughout the year. In foundry and logic, the pace of investment in 20-nanometers is accelerating and expected to continue in 2014, with the market leader currently ramping early 20-nanometer capacity, and with broader customer participation expected at 20-nanometer later in 2014. Initial pilot production of FinFET technology at 16- and 14-nanometer is also expected from the leading foundries in 2014. The introduction of FinFET structures and leading edge logic significantly compounds device complexity that drives new requirements for advanced inspection and measurement to address the significant yield challenges associated with ramping these new devices. In memory, in addition to investment in the 20-nanometer planar roadmap for NAND, the first phase of 3D NAND production has begun and is expected to grow in 2014, with more than one leading edge memory customer announcing intentions to bring 3D NAND devices to market in the year. For DRAM, tight supply conditions and improved pricing environment are driving higher investments. With the increasing cost and complexity associated with introducing 3D structures in leading-edge memory, we're seeing higher adoption of process control for memory customers, and we're strengthening our competitive position in this end market. In summary, 2014 is set up to be an exciting year for our industry and for KLA-Tencor, with CapEx growth projected in each of our major end markets. On the technology front, the cost and complexity associated with competing at the leading edge continues to increase, and our customers can no longer rely solely on scaling to achieve their performance and cost improvement targets. With the incorporation of complex new device architectures, materials and processes, such as multi patterning, FinFET and advanced packaging, the number of process steps requiring inspection and measurement is increasing. And our customers are relying more than ever on KLA-Tencor as the market leader in process control as they execute their growth strategies. Against this backdrop of industry growth, customer competition and increasing device complexity, we believe KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue our market leadership, to benefit from the expanding need for process control and to deliver greater than industry average growth and superior profitability and stockholder returns in 2014. Turning now to the guidance for the March quarter. Bookings are expected to increase approximately 10% at the mid-point and be in a range of $700 million to $900 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $790 million and $850 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1 to $1.20 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren.
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. Revenue for Q2 was in the upper half of the range of guidance at $705 million, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.83. Non-GAAP earnings per share finished the quarter at the upper end of the guided range at $0.85. In our press release, you'll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release. New orders in Q2 were $728 million, finishing below guidance of $800 million to $950 million for the quarter. As previously discussed at investor conference in nearly December, a significant multiple system mash-up order that was originally scheduled to book in Q2 moved out of the quarter as the customer shifted the delivery dates for these tools into the first half of calendar 2015. These shipments are now expected to revenue in the middle of 2015 instead of in the beginning of that calendar year. Customer concentration is driving more volatility around the order profiles on a quarterly basis. Though our December orders fell short of our forecast, our aggregate orders across the December and March quarters remain in the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion we have been targeting, only slightly below the 6-month outlook that we expected at the beginning of the December quarter. This forecast range is consistent with business levels that would support strong revenue growth for KLA-Tencor in 2014 and strong relative performance for the company in what is expected to be a good year for industry growth. Turning now to our customer segment commentary. Foundry came in below the original forecast at 47% of new orders for Q2. Foundry demand was slightly weaker than expected due to timing delays for 28-nanometer fill-out capacity, as well as marginal weakness at the leading edge. We believe the near-term foundry pushouts are largely a timing issue and a function of a variety of factors, including our customers' yield improvement activities related to ramping complex leading-edge device technologies and architectures, in addition to new capacity timing at both the leading edge and at 28-nanometer and customer concentration. We see foundry orders increasing in the March quarter, with strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving order growth. Memory was stronger than expected at 46% of new system orders in December, with upside from DRAM and from the Japan region driving upside in the quarter. We expect memory to decline to 20% of orders in the March quarter, as orders for Phase 1 of the latest NAND capacity project are largely complete and 2 installations are in process. Memory investment remains focused on 3D technology development and new capacity and NAND and technology upgrades in DRAM. Logic was 7% of new orders in December, slightly below the original forecast. Investment by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 63% of the orders we received in the December quarter. Turning now to the regional distribution of new system orders in Q2. The U.S. was 26%, up from 22% in the September quarter. Europe was 1%, down from 8%. Japan was 12%, up from 10%. Korea was 18%, flat to September. Taiwan was 30%, up from 26%. And the rest of Asia was 13%, down from 16%. The approximate distribution of orders by product group was: wafer inspection was 43%; reticle inspection was 11%; metrology was 22%; service was 22%; storage, High Brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%. Total shipments in the quarter were $862 million, up 35% from the September quarter and $32 million above the $830 million mid-point of guidance. Customer pull and activity for shipments of our latest products is encouraging and highlights the demand for the higher performance capability required at the leading edge. In total, we ended the quarter with just over $1.2 billion of total backlog, comprised of $820 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months and $407 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. We expect shipments in the March quarter to be down approximately 13% at the mid-point compared with Q2, as the shipment pull-ins from March into December, coupled with delivery timing for key projects, drives a lower output level in the March quarter. March quarter shipments are expected to be in a range of $720 million to $780 million, and current expectations are for shipments to return to the $800 million to $850 million range in the June quarter. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was $705 million. This result was up 7% quarter-to-quarter. As you may recall, we discussed in last quarter's call that our revenue guidance for the December quarter reflected the impact of high shipment levels of newly introduced products during the quarter. As these are new products, they do not meet our criteria for recognizing revenue upon shipment, so customer acceptance is required on these products for us to recognize the revenue. These systems have met customer expectations, and our product and regional teams have executed our processes well. So we expect we will recognize revenue from these new product shipments in the March quarter. As discussed last quarter, we expect these factors to result in strong sequential revenue growth in the March quarter. For the March quarter, total revenue is expected to be in a range between $790 million and $850 million. Gross margin was 59.8%, up 160 basis points from the September quarter. Our gross margin significantly exceeded guidance for the quarter, due to a favorable product mix and better-than-expected manufacturing efficiencies due to the higher factory output. We expect gross margin to be in a range of 58% to 59% in the March quarter, as the benefit of higher revenue volume is offset by a weaker product mix compared to the December quarter. With faster order-to-revenue conversion rates on backlog, our gross margin volatility on product mix has increased. However, over time, we expect our gross margins to perform consistent with our longstanding 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. Operating expenses were $228 million, flat from the September quarter and in line with the guidance range of $225 million to $230 million. R&D was $133 million, up $2 million from September, as we continue to invest in key research and development activities and customer collaborations for next generation technologies. SG&A for the quarter was $96 million, roughly flat compared with Q1. We are continuing to size the company's quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range and expect it to remain in this range for the next few quarters. The timing of product development investments will lead to some fluctuation within this range quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $11 million, up $1 million from the September quarter. We expect OIE to be a net expense in March, between $10 million and $11 million. The tax rate was 21.5% in the quarter, lower than the 23% planning rate, principally driven by an increase in offshore income relative to the U.S. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share would have been $0.83. Going forward, you should continue to use the long-term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Net income was $143 million or $0.85 per fully diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investment ended the quarter at $2.95 billion, essentially unchanged versus the September quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased $60 million of stock at an average price of $62.87. As of December 31, we had 3.9 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We paid a dividend of $75 million in the quarter. In July, we raised our dividend per share $0.05 to $0.45 per share. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend. Cash from operations was $115 million in the quarter, down $62 million sequentially, as expected, due primarily to higher accounts receivable associated with the ramp in shipments. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $573 million, up $132 million from the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding based on shipments were 61 days. Net inventory increased nominally by $3 million quarter-to-quarter to $663 million to support expected shipment levels for 2015. Inventory turns on GAAP COGS were 1.7x, flat to the September quarter. Net capital expenditures were $14 million to support continued facility expansion activities worldwide. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just over $168 million and are expected to remain roughly flat in the March quarter. Full-time headcount ended the quarter at 5,981. Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of the business environment at the leading edge. We expect that the yield challenges associated with multi-patterning and FinFET will drive sustainable process control investment by foundry and logic customers through 2014. Continued investments in technology buys, in DRAM and 3D NAND development and early production activity, should lead to an increase in overall memory spending versus 2013. Given these expectations, we continue to believe that semiconductor industry CapEx in 2014 will be up about 10% versus 2013. Given process control adoption during node transitions and our market position, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to outperform the overall capital equipment industry in 2014. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the quarter is bookings are expected to be within a range of $700 million to $900 million; revenue between $798 million and $850 million; and EPS of $1 to $1.20. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ted Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions].
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Bren, does the order guidance in March, does that assume that the pushed out reticle business books in March? And then I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Yes, Tim. As we roll it up. I mean, I think, as I said at the end of last quarter, I think that business shifts into the first half. I think, right now, we expect it to book in March. But as I had indicated in the past, I think there is some fluidity to this particular order because the delivery date is further out. So right now, our expectations are that we'll see this business book. But, obviously, there's an extra element of risk with it. And I think because of the size of the ASPs associated with this particular quarter, it is something that has driven our views on, perhaps, maybe a wider range may be appropriate. This, coupled with just general customer concentration, overall, large orders. So that's how we're thinking about it today.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, Rick, there's been a lot of talk about EUV and about the insertion point and a lot of confusion about what TSM has said about EUV and what they haven't said about EUV. But can you just give your perspective? Because it seems like these chip makers are able to push out the need for EUV by just extending emergence. So I'm curious, your perspective on the timing of EUV.
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. I think that the timing has moved out, from my perspective, especially for high-volume manufacturing. And the insertion point at 10 nanometers, I think, is now pushed to 7. Although there still could be a couple areas at 10. But one of the indications we have was the industry's need for an at-wavelength reticle tool. We have seen that push out. Because -- well, the feedback we get from customers is they believe they can make do with what they have in terms of using our 6xx because it's relatively low volume. And it's all about the economics. EUV remains too slow to be put into production on an economic base. So there's a lot of work to do to get the source up, to get the throughput up. But right now, what we're getting from customers is double patterning is more and more the plan of record as they go to 10 nanometers, and that puts EUV and high HBM more at the 7-nanometer node. And that's how we're currently planning.
Operator: And your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Over the past couple of months, it seems as though there has been a firming of your customers' programs and projects across all segments. CapEx outlooks have been provided to the markets. I believe you're still projecting 10% WFE growth this year. But relative to your view 3 months ago, has anything changed as it relates to CapEx spend by segment? It seems like foundry and DRAM could be a bit stronger than previously anticipated. But would love to get your views.
Bren Higgins: Well, I think, on the nearer term -- I think, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks -- in December, we did see a little bit of weakness which we've really attributed more to timing related to non-leading edge foundry and, at the leading edge, some adjustments to some capacity planning. So on the whole, relative to 3 months ago, I think our view is slightly weaker, as I had said. I think in terms of how we're thinking about 2014, we feel pretty confident. It's always hard to say how or where it's going to land from an order and shipment perspective. But in terms of our overall views on the remainder of the year, we still believe that we're looking at somewhere around plus 10%. And as you said, I think as you see more input from customers, in terms of their discussions about next year's planning, I think overall, from a year perspective, we feel pretty good about that forecast today.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. And then the team has talked about the migration to sub-20 nanometers driving a mix that is more focused on some of your high-end inspection tools, like your broadband plasma platform, let's say, versus your darkfield line monitoring products. So given all of the migrations that are taking place across your customer base, how are you seeing that sort of current order mix playing out? Are you seeing that it is being more relatively skewed towards high end and any way to quantify this mix or mixed shift relative to, let's say, 18 to 24 months ago?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. This is Rick. I think that the best way to think about it is the way we laid out the segments and the process control intensity back at our Analyst Day in July. And that is that at 2x you see an increase, overall increase, in process control intensity. And we baseline 4x to 2x from 13.7% blended to 14.7%. So an increase of over 10% in terms of the overall from 13.7% to 14.7%. But -- I guess a little under 10%. But we were basing that partly on the increased adoption of the more advanced tools. And so 2 things have happened. One, the laser-based tools have gotten more complex as you go down, and therefore, higher ASPs. And the broadband plasma also has advanced. And I'd say the mix is more dependent on where you are in the ramp, but I think we laid that out. Early in the ramp, you tend to see more of the broadband plasma tools, and then as the ramp progresses, the laser scanning tools come in. But all of them, because they're more capable, provide more value. And with that comes higher ASP, which is a big part of what drives the overall WFE number. So, so far, what we've seen since we laid out that model publicly but also since we started modeling it probably 24 months ago, it's pretty much conforming to what we thought it would be in terms of that. And we have seen strength in both product lines as we've increased the intensity associated with the new nodes. Does that make sense?
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, makes sense.
Operator: And your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: The first question I had is very close. In terms of your March quarter guidance for memory orders, 20% of your bookings is going to be memory. What is the split between DRAM and NAND? And also, along the 3D NAND side, you said Phase 1 is almost complete for the leader. When do you expect Phase 2 to start ordering?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Krish, it's Bren. I'll go ahead and start. So NAND as a percent of the memory mix is 40%. So 60-40 DRAM to NAND in the March quarter. We've had 4 pretty good quarters from a memory mix perspective and so we think that March is a little bit lower. To my point in the prepared remarks, as most of the orders came in, in the second half, mostly in the September quarter related to the significant project in China. And so those tools shipped in the December quarter and those tools are being installed today. There will be a second phase and we think it's a big part of what happens in 2014. That second phase happens some time midyear and into the fall in terms of timing of deliveries. So that's what we're planning today. And no indications that things are not on track there and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing in terms of the installations and the new tools going in.
Richard P. Wallace: And the other part of your question, I think, talked about other players. We do see other players coming in, in '14, probably toward the later part of '14, for 3D, and maybe 1 or 2 more players in that time frame, depending on how technology development goes for them. But I do think it will be a competitive market if you view out 12 months from now. My estimation is there'll probably be 3 players with that capability and development and ramping.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. Rick, I remember your SEMICON slides on process control intensity growing. I was just wondering, just if I look at foundry specifically, when you go from 20 planar to 16 or 14 FinFET, is there a way to quantify what is the increase in the sam [ph] for you guys?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we did it with steady-state, the steady-state assumption about process control intensity. So it depends how much they're investing in the node obviously. But we had the increase, we had the logic foundry at 2x being 17% going to 18.4%. So not quite a 10% increase in the sam [ph] just from that node transition. But as you know, it depends on where you are in the ramp, it depends on which particular players and what kind of challenges they're facing. But I think, overall, we're continuing to see that kind of pressure, driven largely, of course, by the FinFET challenges with yield, but also the multi-patterning that's more prevalent once you go to the 1x, given the current lithography options people have.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jack Sheng - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Jack Sheng on behalf of Jim Covello. So my first question is, given your view on WFE spending this year, can you just give us an idea of on the weighting of that spending between first half and second half? In addition, can I also get some color on the differences between logic, foundry and memory?
Bren Higgins: Jack, this is Bren. So I think, in terms of weighting, I'm not really ready to call that yet. I think the biggest wildcard in that is, at least from an order perspective, will be timing related to some significant projects that are going to happen in that sort of midyear to fall time frame. But we mentioned the memory project earlier. There are a couple significant projects on the foundry logic side as well. I think the deliveries are fairly firm on those projects in the second half of the year or so. And I think the timing of those, the order placement, I think, is one question in terms of whether the first half of the year is stronger or weaker than the second half. So we'll see how that goes in terms of timing. In terms of mix, overall, I think foundry and logic probably grows in line with market about 10% or so. We think NAND flash is probably up somewhere between 10% and 15%. And we're a little bit more cautious on DRAM just because historically, there's just been more volatility there. So there's some growth there but off a low base. So that's how we're thinking about it. And I think when you think about the overall mix, you probably end up with foundry and logic somewhere around 60% to 65%, the memory 35% to 40%, in terms of how we're thinking about it today.
Jack Sheng - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's incredibly helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, so many of your competitors have been pretty vocal about gaining share over you guys this year. So with that said, how should we think about share shifts and markets such as e-beam and low-beam inspection going forward?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we -- when we look at the market share data over the last several years, in spite of a lot of claims that people have made they're gaining share, we actually feel pretty good about our position and don't really see much evidence of share loss. In fact, in some of our most important segments, we've actually moved ahead. And some of our products it's actually quite hard to measure share. For example, our broadband plasma, there's really not another broadband plasma tool. There are laser-scanning tools, but they compete with our laser scanning where we have a pretty good position. So -- and that -- as I -- if I look out -- I look back and I look forward, I don't see a lot of change in the share position. I do see some potential going forward for some gains on our side. But I don't really -- right now, we've not been experiencing any real significant challenges that make me change our view of our share position. There are always bumps in the road as there have been in the past in certain segments at certain times. But in aggregate, we feel very good about our position and confident we can maintain it going forward.
Operator: And your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I believe you alluded earlier to a statement regarding capital intensity of memory and inspection increasing. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more.
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, Terence. We laid out in SEMICON West we're sticking with the analysis we did, which had, just to remind people, 4x node at about 8.8% capital intensity. As compared to logic and foundry, by the way, it's 15.8%. So significantly less but still increasing, 2x going to 9.3%, and then 1x going to 10.2%. But the other way you can think about 1x is being V-NAND being equivalent even though that's not technically a 1x node. In fact, it goes backwards in terms of lithography technology. But it is increased in overall opportunity for us. And since we laid that out, and we had that model before we laid it out, we've seen market behavior pretty much in order with that dynamic of what we've forecasted of about a 10% increase from the 4x, the 2x node and then another, not quite 10%, but on that order, increase as we go to the V-NAND node.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, terrific, Rick, and then, I believe that you talked a little bit earlier about EUV. My question specifically is, does the change in insertion in EUV that seems to be a consensus now, does that affect any of your investments in EUV reticle inspection? And where are you in the process of developing reticle inspection for EUV?
Richard P. Wallace: It will certainly change our ramping up of our investment. We will maintain core technology and continue to invest. But it -- there have been different scenarios in which we would have ramped that investment over the next couple of years. And what we talked about at SEMICON West was doing that in conjunction and partnership with our key customers to be able to support that ramp. We don't believe that, that's as eminent as people believed it was 9 months ago based on the delays and productivity gains on the scanner. So we will continue to invest, but it'll be at -- we won't see a ramp as we had forecasted going forward. But again, that was going to be shared with customers. So Bren can speak to the implication that has to the overall model. But in general, we won't be ramping our investment as soon as we originally planned.
Bren Higgins: Yes, so Terence, I think that from an EUV perspective, we've been essentially investing in early development activity, technological feasibility work. And so we continue to do that obviously, having the ability to continue to progress here and maintain some optionality around this. It's important for us. But I don't expect inflection on spending, and that's why I feel pretty comfortable with the guidance around our OpEx sort of flattening out here at this level over the next several quarters.
Operator: And your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I'm a little bit confused, Rick. If I were to take the $100 million out of your March guide, it suggests to me that the core business declined by 8% compared to September and March will be down 4%. And we have been waiting for these turns, especially from foundry side, for almost 12 months. So where is the turn? And from what I hear from now, there is incremental emphasis on 3D NAND. Can you help me reconcile the trend and how you see things evolving? Because your booking trend is not really giving me much confidence. And I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: Well, as I said, I mean, I think that it is a bit of a wide range because we're not exactly sure how the reticle inspection business sort of ends up here at the end of the quarter. I mean, as I said earlier, there has been a little bit of weakness on the foundry and logic side of things over the December quarter and into March in terms of timing around some of the non-leading-edge activity. And I think some rational, not with the rationalization, but some digestion, if you will, around some of the wafer start plans for particular customers on the leading edge. So we think that, that resolves itself. It's mostly about timing. And I think, as I said earlier, I mean, fluctuations quarter-to-quarter here in our order profile, given the size of the orders, the number of customers, the big ASPs and so on, can cause a little bit of volatility there. I don't think the order number is as a cyclical indicator, perhaps, as it used to be, as the industry has changed. As we look at calendar '14, we continue to believe, consistent with the revenue guidance for the March quarter, that we're operating at $800 million to $850 million range from a revenue perspective. We'll see some fluctuations in orders, to a larger extent in shipment. But that's how we see the year and that's how we're sizing the company to support the dynamics they're having in the industry.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I'd also just add to that. I think what we saw in September was uncharacteristically strong for that part of the cycle. Typically, September, we don't have enough quarter like that. And I think, in effect, what we had was some pull-in to the September quarter from December and then we did actually have a little pushout from September -- from December into March. But to Bren's point, when we aggregate it and we look out, it's still pretty much falling in line with what we believed would happen if you integrate it over time. And I think, as we look out for '14, that's pretty consistent with our view as well.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Sure. Let me ask the question a different way. You talked about $800 million to $850 million of shipments for the June. Would you have to hit the high end of your booking guide to do that shipment in June, given where your backlog is?
Bren Higgins: No, I think given just timing in terms of where deliveries are lining up, it's driving a lower number than you would expect in the March quarter. And I think, as we move into June, we'll see that, that ramp pick -- we'll see a ramp in shipments in June, which is why I put that color into the prepared remarks. So I think that's consistent with general views around the current views of the range in the midpoint to be able to make that happen. Obviously, if you were to come in the extreme low end of the range or below that and then perhaps those plans would change. But given our backlog and the lead time we get from customers, we feel pretty good about how those quarters are shaking out.
Richard P. Wallace: And also, Mehdi, the other thing is on those -- on that bookings, to some degree, the bookings we're talking about that have been in question, some of the reticle bookings, wouldn't ship in June anyway, right? So that's more a part of the -- what it would look like in terms of where we are in that range. And that's part of the wildcard and the wide range for the quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Farhan, asking a question on behalf of John. My first question is on memory. If I look at the long-term trend, KLAC's orders in memory segment have outpaced your peers' and I just wanted to understand better, like what's driving the long-term growth on a relative basis to your peers in terms of memory growing at a faster rate for KLA. Is it more of a market trend or more of a market share trend?
Richard P. Wallace: Great question. I think there's 2 elements. One, our share has definitely increased in memory. We've focused on that a few years ago. It didn't show up because there wasn't a lot of memory activity and so when finally the memory guys started spending, we benefited from that trend. The other thing is that the process control intensity has increased with the new design roles. And lastly, I think that the memory manufacturers have recognized the value of getting memory process control capability early in the ramp or for technology development. So part of what we're seeing is accelerated demand earlier in the cycle. I think it does normalize over time to the process control intensity we talked about at SEMICON West. So in some ways, we'll get -- we'll benefit very early in the ramp. There's also some technology catch-up. There were people that were doing investments were on hold for a while, I think, while they were integrating acquisitions and so on. And once they got focused again on manufacturing at new nodes, they invested. So I think it's a combination of those 3 factors: increased share, increased investment, process control intensity and timing of where they are in the cycle.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got it. And just one question on the June shipments. I mean, your -- if I adjust for the $100 million of orders, the guidance for March quarter orders is in the range of -- it's lower than the December quarter. You're basically guiding to $600 million to $800 million. How can you get a shipment growth in June quarter? Because the $100 million order won't start shipping in the June quarter. So the June quarter orders need to increase significantly, is that a fair assumption?
Bren Higgins: Also I'm not guiding the June quarter shipments. I was just giving some color on our expectations about the range. When we get there, we'll actually provide a number. But as I look at the build plans today and the timing of some of these shipments, I would have expected, given our expectations for the quarter, that shipments would have been a little bit higher this quarter. But as I said it was all about where delivery timing is set up. So as I look at the June quarter, given our expectations for orders in the next 6 months, plus our backlog position, I was comfortable with providing the color statement that I gave around $800 million to $850 million range. So that's how we're thinking about it. And we'll see -- around those reticle inspection shipments, we'll see where those ultimately end up landing from an order perspective. And as I said earlier, that's why we're -- I've expanded the range to see how -- to deal with that potential risk.
Operator: And your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Mahavir. Just one question about order profile for calendar '14. Rick, you talked about a number of memory projects in the second half. And if you look at the memory order guidance for the March quarter, it's at $160 million roughly and your peak was about $300 million back in September quarter. Just wondering if we should think about order profile as perhaps growing throughout 2014 or kind of bucking the trend, if you will, in the September quarter when you typically have a decline.
Bren Higgins: Yes. As I said earlier, I think it's hard to say in terms of the timing of that business midyear. And I think I mentioned one significant memory project. The others were foundry and logic projects that are out there in that time frame. So we'll just have to see, from a timing perspective, where they land. I mean, one situation that we do deal with today is we do get less lead time than we used to get historically, so in terms of order to shipment. So there is some fluidity, if you will, in terms of the timing. But in terms of how we're lining up the rest of the year, we see ourselves operating in this range of $800 million to $850 million and orders could come in above that level, orders could come a little bit below that level in the 12-month or 12-week cycle. But at the end of the day, we think we're going to -- we're operating at that level.
Operator: Your next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest Securities.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just real quickly, you had mentioned advanced packaging is one of the drivers for growth. And I just wondered if you could give us some idea how much of that really could be contributing at this point and potentially how big that market could be and maybe even if you could lay it out over the next couple of years, that would be helpful.
Richard P. Wallace: Not much. I mean, we're not counting on advanced packaging for calendar '14 to significantly contribute. We do have some investigations developments there. But we're not -- that's not in our baseline for what we're seeing out for the rest of this year.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: So -- understood. But since you mentioned it as one of the drivers for growth, can you give us an idea of how the market could evolve maybe for you?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we have some plan and I do think there are -- if you look out a couple of years, there's probably $100 million or so of opportunity on an annualized basis for us there but we're not seeing that today. We're seeing maybe part of that and so I do think there's some growth opportunity. But it's -- it would be high growth rate just off of a reasonably small base.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, I just want to follow up on your commentary on the foundry. Can you give your view on what do you think is driving the delay or pushout of the foundry, especially the -- I'm interested in the 20-nanometer? Is it that customer is having issue ramping or that the demand has pushed out? That would be very helpful.
Richard P. Wallace: I think there's a couple of things. One, there's -- certainly, not everybody is delaying. So I think it's more -- the leaders are still going and then there's there some delay behind. And I think the delays tend to be around a combination of factors. One is getting the process right, so the yield is there so they can ramp. The other one is I do think there is a bit of churn going on based on some management changes in some of the foundries. And I think that's creating, at least, a pause, as people are regrouping and trying to figure out different kind of partnership strategies and who might be doing what for whom.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. I think that makes perfect sense. On -- and there's one -- I want to follow up on the EUV reticle inspection. I know you mentioned in the past that you would need in order of $500 million of investment from your partners to be able to invest in that project. What's the response? Is the customers, they're not willing to do that or they want to wait and -- but they would do it? What's the response on that -- your proposal?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we said, just to clarify, $500 million we thought was the total cost and we were looking to share that. So not $500 million from them but $500 million in total. The response was there was a lot of interest last summer and earlier last year. But it was all contingent on people feeling like the insertion point was going to be as planned. I think every one of the major partners we talked to indicated their belief that the insertion was delaying and, therefore, their urgency waned quite a bit. So they're all very interested. Many have said, not just the overall companies, but individuals, that they think it's a must because the need for pellicles is becoming clear on EUV. The challenge with the need for pellicles is -- the need for pellicles also means more power is needed because the pellicle actually consumes some of the power. But it does drive the market to need an actinic tool in high-volume manufacturing. But the biggest issue is the perceived delay in the timing of that high volume. So interest, but not yet at the point of us securing funding where that looked [ph]. I'd say much more promising if I go back 9 months in terms of it being a near term. And we're in agreement with our customers that we don't want to be investing in a capability that they don't need because jointly there are great, high-return projects we could do. And so instead, we're focusing our efforts on supporting the multi-patterning challenges that people are going to face as the alternative to EUV.
Operator: And your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So first one is on gross margin. This past quarter, you have a margin expansion. You mentioned favorable mix. Just wanted to know if that's metrology inspection or customer mix, any kind of color around that? And then I noticed that you guys are effectively guiding margin to be lower in the coming quarter but your revenue backlog actually expanded and you have more tools being signed off by customers. Why are you guiding margin to be lower?
Bren Higgins: Yes. So gross margins in the December quarter were stronger than expected and our product mix was a little bit richer than what we thought it would be in the October quarter or at the October call. So we're higher in wafer inspection. Obviously, it has higher gross margin and so that was a part of that as well as higher-end reticle inspection as well. As I look into the March quarter, I mean, we are benefiting. And then, of course, I think also in the December quarter, efficiencies in manufacturing were favorable to our planning. So we had a very strong incremental gross margin in March outperforming -- or in December outperforming our model, 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. We'll underperform it a little bit in the March quarter as the mix is less favorable. But I think when you think about it, over the 6-month time frame, I think the incremental gross margins are high 60s, 68%, 69%. So a little bit of volatility driven by some of the dynamics I mentioned earlier. So it depends what you're shipping and as those tools revenue that drives gross margin. We do have, obviously, a number of products in the company and they all have different margin profiles. So mix is probably a bigger factor for us than it is for some of our peers.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. And then for -- I think, Rick, you mentioned on your prepared remark that you have record order for OCD and metrology is very strong. Was wondering if that's driven by the kind of foundry or the logic side. Or are you seeing incremental demand on the memory side because of things like 3D NAND? What's the driver for the stronger booking? And is this a sustainable trend?
Richard P. Wallace: I think it is. I -- not -- probably not quarter-to-quarter, just the way the orders tend to come in kind of lumpy that way. But what's driving it is really 3D structures, both in memory, but also in logic. That and finally having capability to meet the needs. It's a very tough technical challenge, and it's taken our team who has done incredible work -- it takes a lot of work to get to having solutions that are robust enough to work in production. But we've made a lot of progress and I think we're seeing the benefit from that. And as we forecast going forward, I think it's a -- it's not a technically a share opportunity in the sense that we have a large share. I think it's a share opportunity in terms of against the alternatives, which historically, CD SEMs have been the primary use for -- primarily used for CD measurement. But I think the optical has a lot of capability, especially when you're dealing with the 3D structures.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Rick, maybe first, can you give a little more color in terms of the 3D NAND opportunity? When you mentioned the process control intensity being above 10% [indiscernible], is there a waiting or a bias towards inspection or metrology? Or is it kind of a mix of both kind of 50-50 split in terms of the increasing process control intensity for 3D NAND?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I don't think there's much difference actually. There's, I guess, probably, I'd say, maybe a little metrology bias because overlay becomes a bigger challenge. I do think that the 3D inspection challenge is pretty significant as well. But I think probably, it's a little biased toward metrology. But I wouldn't say by a lot. I don't have the data in front of me. But my gut says it's probably a little more metrology focused, although we had success with inspection. I mean, one of the big challenges people had and their fears, and I think we're not out of the woods yet because nobody's really ramped in production on it, was trying to figure out how, once you identify defects, you can deal with them because they're going to be varied and what is the -- how do you determine the root cause and then fix it. And we've got some clever inspection technology, as well as metrology and technology, to be able to penetrate those layers. But there's still this issue of fixing and moving forward. But overall, if I'd have to tip it, I'd tip it a little more toward the metrology side.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. That's really helpful. And maybe a big-picture industry outlook. I think you've given us a good color of what you expect for 2014. But obviously, there are always a lot of moving pieces. If the industry does trend, and you've seen many of these upturns, a lot of time they track higher than expected. If there are key customer variables as we get into the second half of the year, where do you see the potential upside between foundry and, say, memory? Where's the greater chance for upside potential as the year progresses?
Richard P. Wallace: Wow, it's a good question. I don't have a great answer. I guess I would say foundry because I think there is -- foundry can be driven like -- I guess both can be driven by this opportunity for share gain. But foundry, in particular, I think there's a lot of dynamics around that and I do think the fabless companies would like to be able to have alternatives. And so if you have success of the advanced nodes at multiple foundries, I think you could see investment tracking that. Memory guys, I think, are going to have to prove out 2 things. One, the DRAM technologies. And we know that, overall, they're not as capital-intensive as the foundries would be. And then 3D, I think, you could have the followers to the leader come in. But I'd say, again, if I had to bias it, I'd say probably a little more toward the foundry and logic phase toward the end of the year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Ben Pang with Northland Capital.
Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: First, just to follow up on the EUV pushout. How long does it take you to develop your part of this technology?
Richard P. Wallace: 2017, 2018 is what we'd said we'd have a production tool had we gone and followed the investment plan. So I think we're looking closer toward 2020 based on what I anticipate a massive -- a one-node essentially shift toward HBM. Now we do have capability in our 6xx, and I think customers will utilize that for the relatively small volume. But I would say that the HBM that's going to require actinic reticle is pushed out.
Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: And when you talk about small volumes in terms of just the number of layers, that would be a 1 or 2 layer you would look at it as high volume or small volume?
Richard P. Wallace: Low volume. And I think what will happen is there's going to be a number of EUV scanners out there that are already -- people are committed to getting. There's a number, they're going to want to use. And once they're out there, they're going to want to try what they can to get in some production. But they're relatively low throughput. So they're going to get a couple of layers. On their own, economically, they wouldn't have probably passed. But since they're already out there, they're going to get used. But there's not going to be a massive ecosystem development to support that. That's what I'm talking about. That's the HBM stuff. So it's not inconsistent with the idea that there's going to be a number of scanners out there. They're just not going to be doing a lot of layers on them.
Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then a follow-up on the reticle inspection pushout. Is that an indication that 10-nanometer has also pushed out then?
Bren Higgins: Well, it's about -- yes, that was what we said in December. That the customers had split their delivery date, and it -- because they split the delivery date, they split the PO placements. So those delivery dates slipped into the first half of 2015. And as a result, the orders will slip into the first half of this year. So we're planning for them. But I'm always a little cautious. Once you've had one move and a point -- there is some fluidity around those plans. And perhaps, one slips into June. And it -- and then which is why we wanted to set the order guidance the way we did in terms of the range. Because at $30 million, you can have a sales impact on, and you'll end up the course [indiscernible].
Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Okay. My question is more, is that an industry trend or just specific customer?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I'll jump in on that. I don't think it's a big trend. I think it's -- we're talking about the timing and I think they're -- they do have capability to handle some of the development with the existing tool. And this is to get to higher volume. So I think -- and Bren's point, it's a 3- to 6-month kind of delay. And these are people that were ahead. So I don't know that it's an industry issue.
Bren Higgins: The issue will come is if everybody else, when they're -- the whole industry struggles on the FinFET technology, what does that do overall, does that push everything? And that's gotten a lot of people's attention, the challenges associated with FinFET.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters.
Ted Lockwood: Thank you, operator. And on behalf of management, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on our call today. Just a reminder, an audio replay will be available on our website later this afternoon. And once again, we appreciate your continuing interest in KLA-Tencor.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Ted Lockwood: Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you'll find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2013, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information, including factors that could cause those differences, is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2013 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone. I will lead off the call today with summary highlights in Q1 and the current business environment, and then provide guidance for the December quarter. Then Bren will follow with more details on the results. Q1 2014 was a good quarter for KLA-Tencor, demonstrating our market leadership, the strength of our core markets and process control and solid operational execution. New orders in Q1 grew 11% sequentially to $790 million, above the range of guidance and setting a new record for total bookings for the company in the September quarter. We experienced good momentum in order activity in the quarter, and demand was strong across each of our end markets, highlighted by record memory customer bookings in Q1. Bookings activity was also robust in foundry, where we witnessed pull-in orders to support 20-nanometer development. The solid demand affirms our ongoing focus on providing superior value to customers, both in terms of meeting market requirements and delivering superior competitive offerings. In fact, a key contributor to our strong bookings performance in Q1 was the success of new products, particularly with memory customers, with whom, we achieved quick acceptance of our latest generation plasma inspection tools, as well as a key mask inspection win. With the increasing cost and complexity associated with leading-edge memory, we are seeing higher adoption of process control for memory customers, a trend we believe will continue to benefit KLA-Tencor over time given our market leadership position in that field. As we look ahead to the December quarter and into 2014, we expect continued strong order momentum, high levels of business activity with our customers. And we believe this sets the stage for a positive calendar year 2014 for demand and capital equipment industry overall, and for process control in particular, giving the increasing importance the process control is playing in helping our customers achieve their growth and cost objectives at the leading edge. With KLA-Tencor's strong backlog, our market position and the forecasted growth of the segments in which we participate, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to successfully execute our strategies to deliver superior growth and financial performance relative to our industry and return significant value to stockholders. Looking ahead to the December quarter, we expect the strong demand environment to continue as momentum for new technology development continues to strengthen across multiple customers. We're encouraged by the pace of this investment and how well we are positioned with new products to address this increasing cost and complexities that are associated with competing at the leading edge. Now for guidance for the December quarter. December bookings are expected to increase approximately 10% at the midpoint and be in a range of $800 million to $950 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $670 million and $730 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.67 to $0.87 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bren Higgins for his comments. Bren?
Bren Higgins: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon. This was a solid quarter for KLA-Tencor in terms of financial performance and operational execution. Revenue for Q1 was $658 million. Fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.66. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.68. In our press release, you'll find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of the $0.02 difference. My comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments covered in the press release. As Rick mentioned, Q1 results are highlighted by new orders finishing above the upper end of the range of guidance at $790 million, with our order forecast for both Q1 and for Q2 strengthening as we progressed through the quarter. Memory investment is focused on 3D technology development and new capacity in NAND and technology upgrades in the DRAM. Foundry demand in Q1 was stronger than expected with upside to our original forecast coming from pull-in orders to support 20-nanometer development and pilot activity. We see foundry orders increasing in Q2, with ramp in investment in 20-nanometer and strong customer acceptance of our latest generation products driving order growth. The regional distribution in new system orders and quarter-to-quarter change was: the U.S. was 22%, down from 38% in the June quarter; Europe was 8%, up from 6%; Japan was 10%, down from 12%; Korea was 18%, up from 10%; Taiwan was 26%, up from 10%; and the rest of Asia was 16%, down from 24% last quarter. The distribution of orders by product group was: wafer inspection was approximately 52%, reticle inspection was 8%; metrology was 19%; service was 20%; storage, High Brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 1%. Finally, for new semiconductor system orders, the approximate distribution by customer segment was as follows. As expected, memory was strong once again at 47% in new system orders in September compared to 44% in June. Foundry came in above the original forecast at 45% in new orders, an upside from sales directed at 20-nanometer compared with 33% in June. Logic was 8% in new orders versus 23% in June, which was in line with our original forecast. Our continued heavy investment in research and development is enabling us to maintain our strong position at the leading edge as evidenced by the fact that investments by our customers at 20-nanometer and below constituted roughly 76% of the orders we received in the September quarter. Total shipments in the quarter were $637 million, down 17% from the June quarter and slightly under the midpoint of the guidance range. In total, we ended the quarter with just over 1.2 billion of backlog comprised of $964 million of shipment backlog or orders that are not yet shipped to customers and expect to ship over the next 6 months, and $251 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been signed off by customers. We expect shipments in the December quarter to grow 30% at the midpoint compared with Q1 and be in the range of $800 million to $860 million, with a number of newly released products shipping in volume in the quarter. Turning to our income statement, I'm proud of the operational execution in the September quarter with revenue, gross margin and earnings finishing at or above the upper end of our guidance ranges. Revenue for the quarter was $658 million. This level is down 9% quarter-to-quarter and down 9% versus the same quarter last year. For the December quarter, total revenue is expected in the range between $670 million and $730 million. Our revenue guidance for the December quarter reflects the impact of high shipment levels of newly introduced products during the quarter. In general, our revenue recognition policy requires the completion of formal customer acceptance on new products prior to recognizing revenue. This formal acceptance process typically takes up to 90 days to complete. As a result, revenue recognition on several tools shipping during the quarter is expected to be delayed into the March quarter. Once the acceptance pattern is demonstrated for new products that ship to the same facilities with the same specifications, our policy generally allows for revenue recognition at the time of shipment. As a result, we expect strong sequential revenue growth in the March quarter as we begin to recognize revenue from the December newly released product shipments and as these shipments begin to convert into revenue more rapidly than in the December quarter. Gross margin was 58.2%, up 40 basis points from the June quarter despite the lower systems revenue level. Our gross margin exceeded guidance due to the favorable product mix and lower inventory reserve charges in the quarter. We expect gross margin to remain roughly flat in the December quarter as we support higher levels of manufacturing in shipments. As revenue grows over the next several quarters, we expect gross margin to increase consistent with our 60% to 70% incremental gross margin model. Operating expenses were $228 million, up $5 million from the June quarter. Operating expenses were $8 million higher than the midpoint of guidance for the quarter, primarily due to a pull-in of investments for some of our engineering programs and timing issues associated with cost-sharing milestones of certain projects. R&D was $131 million, up $5 million from June as we continue to invest in key research and development activities and customer collaborations for next-generation technologies. SG&A for the quarter was $97 million, about flat quarter-on-quarter. Going forward, we are sizing the company's quarterly operating expenses in the $225 million to $230 million range for the next several quarters. The timing of engineering investments and milestone achievements in our cost-sharing programs will lead to some fluctuations within this range quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense for the quarter was a net expense of $10 million, down slightly from the June quarter. We expect a similar result in the December quarter. The tax rate was 21% in the quarter, lower than the 23% planning rate due primarily to nontaxable increases in our deferred compensation savings plan and the tax benefits resulting from divesting of employee equity awards in the quarter. At the 23% guided tax rate for the quarter, earnings per share would have been $0.66. Going forward, you should continue to use the long term planning rate of 23% for modeling purposes. Net income was $115 million, or $0.68 per fully diluted share. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investment ended the quarter at $2.95 billion, an increase of $33 million over the June quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 61 million of stock at an average price of $58.31. As of September 30, we have 4.8 million shares available for repurchase under our current authorization. We paid a dividend of $75 million in the quarter. In July, we raised our dividend per share $0.05 to $0.45 per share. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend and reflects our ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Cash from operations was $177 million in the quarter, comparable to the June quarter. Net inventory increased by $26 million quarter-to-quarter to $660 million to support the expected shipment ramp. Inventory turns on GAAP COGS were 1.7 versus 1.9 in the June quarter. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $441 million, down $84 million from the prior quarter. Day sales outstanding based on shipments were 63 days. Net capital expenditures were $22 million to support facility expansion activities worldwide. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter just under $169 million and are expected to remain flat for the December quarter. Full-time headcount ended the quarter at 5,913. Finally, as we commented earlier, we're encouraged by the strength of the business environment at the leading edge. We believe the factors we described earlier that led to what looks to be a strong second half of calendar year 2013 will continue into 2014, giving us confidence that we'll see industry CapEx growth in 2014 of about 10%, if not a few points higher than that. Given process control adoption during no transitions in our market position, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to deliver market leading revenue growth. With that, to reiterate, our guidance for the quarter is: bookings are expected to be within the range of $800 million and $950 million; revenue between $670 million and $730 million; and earnings per share of $0.67 to $0.87. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ted Lockwood: Okay, thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] We'll do our best to make sure everyone has a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permits. So, Mike, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer with Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Farhan, calling in for John. You're guiding to a very strong growth in the January quarter. And I just wanted to understand what's the mix that you're expecting. Is it going to be mainly foundry-driven? Relative to your shipments in this quarter, how do you expect the mix in the January quarter -- sorry, in the March quarter?
Bren Higgins: I think you mean the December quarter. We're not going to guide the March quarter. This is Bren. So when you think about the mix for December, we see memory at about 30%, and that's 50-50 NAND and DRAM. Logic at about 10% and then foundry would be 60%.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Krish Shankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick or Bren, first question, when you look at all the memory-related bookings you're getting, are these primarily technology-related? In other words, I'm trying to figure out does this mean that they will slowly start weaning off for you guys as the quarter progresses because the technology buys would be done by then?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, as Bren mentioned in his prepared remarks, the memory -- there's 2 elements in memory. One is the work on 3D, which is a new technology that's going to be ramping over the next several quarters. And then the other is on DRAM, there are technology buys. And I think we're well-positioned in both to see increasing adoption, which we laid out that case at SEMICON West and that's starting to be what we're seeing now. So I think we're in reasonably good shape. And also, as we mentioned, there is the element of the technology buys at the front end of ramps, and we hope to continue to see that over the next couple of quarters.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And then if I could just -- for the follow-up, December quarter looks like you might probably do $400 million in bookings on the foundry side. Can you help us understand how many foundries is it going to be? Is it going to be 1, 2, or 3, and is it all 20-nanometer?
Bren Higgins: Yes, this is Bren. And I'll start and then Rick can follow up. So most of the activity we expect in the December quarter is focused on 20 and below. Multiple customers, investing. There will probably be some 28 investments as well that will happen in the quarter, but that's generally how we see it.
Richard P. Wallace: Right. I think everyone is in the mode right now -- all the foundry players are in the mode of needing to make investments to support the FinFET work that they're doing below 20, but we're also seeing, as Bren mentioned, some of the guys are maybe a little bit behind or also investing to get yields up as they anticipate 20-nanometer demand. There is even some 28 spending that is still going on.
Operator: Your next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Given your view on WFE spend for next year and sort of given your pipeline and visibility, Rick, can you just give us an idea on the weighting of that spend, maybe first half versus second half and some color on how the different market segments, logic, foundry, memory will kind of shake out from a mix perspective next year?
Richard P. Wallace: Why don't I let Bren start and then I'll follow-up?
Bren Higgins: So I think -- I don't think know if we can comment at this point around whether it's first half or second half. I mean right now, it feels pretty evenly distributed. But we'll see how that goes as we get closer to it. When you think about the composition, I think memory is probably somewhere between 30% and 40%. And so I think you'll see logic foundry there at 70 with, let's say, the logic pieces around 20 and foundry at the difference. So as I said, pretty evenly distributed. I think we're, right now, we're sizing the company given our comments in the prepared remarks around WFE, up 10%, maybe a few points better. So that, I think, puts us in a position where we're sort of sizing the company around $800 million to $850 million a quarter in terms of new business levels.
Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Got it. And given that most of the activity today is around both migration and given the significant step up in complexity for this next-generation processes, I know that you guys have talked about increased process control intensity at the front or the ramp of a new node. But are you guys also seeing a bias towards usage of predominantly leading-edge tools, like for example, a bias towards your 29xx platform versus your 28xx platform? Any way to quantify, let's say, for 3D NAND or 16-nanometer FinFET, what percentage of tools are skewed towards your leading-edge tools, is it 70, 30, and so on?
Richard P. Wallace: No. It's more -- it's higher than that if you're talking sub-20-nanometer. And really, the mix is not so much 29xx versus prior generation. The broadband plasma, I think, is almost all going to be the 29xx if you look below the 20-nanometer. It's really a blend of that versus the laser scanning tools that we have. And again, as we laid out at SEMICON West, you'll see a mixture of that probably at the front end of a ramp more heavily loaded toward the broadband plasma and then later in the ramp, the laser tools will come into play. But you're right, process intensity going up. We think in 2014, probably somewhere 15% to 16%, and that really depends, as Bren indicated before, what -- how memory ends up being as a total percent of the mix. While memory is up, it's, as we know, it's less intensive for process control than foundry and logic is.
Operator: The next question is from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: First thing, Bren, just a reference to your answer that you just gave. So you're sort of implying that March quarter revenue, given all the deferred, is sort of an $825-ish million range, is that right?
Bren Higgins: Well, I'm not guiding it, but I think that given these new tools actually get acceptance and we move into the March quarter, there is going to be a delay there. So I'm expecting strong sequential growth, somewhere in probably the 10% to 12% off of the midpoint. So I'm not guiding March. $825 million probably feels a little high, but we'll see how we do when we get there and we'll see what happens in terms of our performance relative to the guidance ranges that we gave. The higher end, I think it makes it more possible, but we'll have to see how it plays out.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then can you just give us the September breakdown in memory bookings by NAND and DRAM? And then I wanted to ask Rick, if I look at R&D expense and I just compare it relative to the last time you were sort of an $800 million range. I'm just looking at the March. It's like a good $15 million, $20 million, arguably even $25 million higher. So can you just sort of address what that increment is? Is it related to $450 million versus last time or is it related to an increased competitive environment?
Richard P. Wallace: So first on the NAND versus the DRAM in the September quarter, it was 60% NAND, 40% DRAM. As far as the increased R&D, there's a couple of factors. One, just the advanced technologies are requiring more investment and just the materials alone, if you think about bringing those in, are up. But there are 2 programs that are -- so I would argue absent EUV work that we're doing in the reticle space and some of the 450 we're doing, we'd actually be at a lower level. But -- so the efficiency keeps going. But that's not really fair because we have to do 450, and there's some element of investment that's going on with that. And then the EUV, while it's not at full rate, it is certainly taking investment that is now -- probably nothing comparable to that back then because we were at the end of the 6xx peak investment at that point. So I think those are the probably the 2 biggest single elements to that.
Bren Higgins: I guess the only other thing I'd add to that is that we are investing in some other markets that we weren't back then. So that's probably a factor in this as well, right? So more TAM [ph] opportunity but some investment requirements to participate.
Operator: Your next question is from Srini Sundararajan.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: The additional spend from Intel on solving the defect density, do you have an idea on what that could be and whether you will see that from other vendors such as other foundries such as TSMC and others?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, as you know, we're not going to comment on specific customers. But in general, it is absolutely true that once you go sub-20 or really, it's about FinFET, that I think that process control and complexities really increase in 2 areas. And I'd say one is, no question, there's more metrology opportunity there, especially as EUV is being delayed. I think there's more opportunity for opportunity in process control around just the patterning space. And then the other one is defectivity, and we are seeing advanced opportunities for us as people go sub-20. And as I mentioned earlier, the need to go to our latest generation broadband plasma tools and the latest generation laser scanning tools. So I think all those factors are contributing.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Summit Research Partners, LLC: Okay, just a quick follow-up. Rick, do you have any comments on the Tokyo Electron, Applied Materials merger potentially?
Richard P. Wallace: No, not really. I mean I think that it kind of makes sense, I suppose, from their perspective. From ours, it's -- the one perhaps advantage is we've remained very focused on an opportunistic time period where we've got a great market. And I think one of our competitors is going to be a bit distracted. But we're not kidding ourselves. All competition is going to be intense and we got to continue to execute.
Operator: Your next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, I have a question on the memory booking. And If I look at a number and also triangulating with kind of increased memory intensity that you guys talked about on this -- during SEMICON, it seems like memory booking is picking up a lot faster. Do you see that the memory intensity is actually expanding faster than what you guys have talked? Well, I think you guys talked about only 140 basis point on the next 2 node. Do you expect that to kind of accelerate as you see these new memory orders?
Richard P. Wallace: We don't know. It's early. But I would say 2 factors. One, there was a long period in which people weren't investing. And I think that there's a bit of catch-up going on relative to that. And then the other factor is I think some of the guys that are ramping new technologies have recognized the value of accelerating their investments. So getting inspection metrology capability in place at the front end. And some of those guys have logic experience now and they recognize the value of that. So I think there's some catch-up. I think there's front end loading, small degree. And I think that I'd still stick with the model that we showed at West.
Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I see. Okay, that's helpful. And my follow-up just quickly on account FinFET versus 20-nanometer planar gate, right? You said a step-up in process control intensity. Based on the comments from the last question, it sounds like you believe there is. And in that way, if that is, is there a way that you can kind of quantify that?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. We definitely model that as we laid it out at West. But I think the process control intensity goes up both in the metrology space but also the defectivity. We did quantify that. I don't have a...
Bren Higgins: About 30%, if you went from, let's say, 28 to 20 and below. A little hard to parse out what's 16 versus 20. I mean, they're doing the lithography at 20, FinFET at 16 and below. But generally, about a 30% increase in terms of dollars per wafer start. It's the same tool set, generally, for the 20 and below. So we capture it that way.
Operator: Your next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, a question on consolidation in the process control. We still have several players in the process control. In visual processing side, you're seeing a pretty good consolidation. What are your thoughts on consolidation, especially in the metrology segment?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I don't see a lot of impetus to change for us. I think we're well-positioned with the products that we have. It may be true that some of the smaller players that we compete with will find that there's some benefit in merging or doing some M&A. But I kind of don't think that makes a lot of sense because a lot of what they've done to be able to have a business at all is focused on a segment. And I actually think that they would run the risk of losing some focus if they were to try to put together companies that didn't naturally go together. I don't think anybody else has the same kind of opportunity to put together a KLA-Tencor kind of company based on just geographies and technologies. And I think we're uniquely positioned to do that. So it may happen, but I don't see it likely that it happens.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And then one more question on market share. I think, earlier in the year when the markets were a little bit weaker and your orders were weaker, there were a lot of discussions on market share losses in several segments. Now that you are coming to closer to the end of the year, do you have a good estimate for where you will end up in market share on some of the segment, particularly on the wafer inspection, considering that there are claims being made that you're losing market share?
Richard P. Wallace: Right. We don't see it. We haven't seen that we are losing. We've seen, in fact, that we have some strengthening going on in the broadband plasma adoption, which is very high-value capability for our customers, strong performance for us. I think that it's always hard when we have competitors who have a small part of their business in our space. It's hard to refute their claims that they're gaining share. But I think if you look at our overall relative performance, we seem to be doing well, and I think that's a function of both process control adoption but also our share. We think there's actually opportunity, I mentioned this at SEMICON West, to see some gains in market share through this year and then into 2014. And we feel very good about the position we're [Audio Gap] that we had in the quarter are associated with new technologies, new capabilities. So we think that that's strengthening our position as we go forward. So we feel very good about the market share.
Operator: Your next question is from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Rick, I just wanted to understand your outlook in 2014, kind of 2014. If you're talking about increasing process control intensity and greater process control share in the memory space, is it fair to say that you guys should see better-than-expected revenue growth, better then industry revenue growth in 2014? And also, can you talk about how you see the use of e-Beam tools, sub-20-nanometer node in logic?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I'll let Bren take part one and I'll take the second part.
Bren Higgins: Yes. I think you know we covered this a little bit in our prepared remarks. But I think given the compelling nature of these node transitions and how customers are now actively moving that direction that we think we are positioned to see the kind of dynamics that we saw, let's say, in 2011 and 2012 around relative growth for process control in KLA. So I think, in contrast to most or the earlier part of this year where maturing yields in 28-nanometer, the last sort of 1/3 of capacity being added that most of the spend was really focused on capacity buys. So as we move forward here with what we believe is a strong technology environment, given the strength that we're seeing with our new products and multiple new products across all our major core segments, we feel pretty good about an opportunity to outperform the industry.
Richard P. Wallace: In terms of e-Beam below 20-nanometer, I probably meant it this way. I think the e-Beam per review of optically detected defects continues to be a good segment to be in. And we have a very strong position in that segment. We gained share recently and have a great product offering there. In terms of inspection, it remains a niche application. I do think there are opportunities for it but it's a relatively small niche. And I think it would grow on the order of similar kind of growth rate to what we see in optical inspection, overall, probably not as fast. But I think there is some opportunity but it's pretty niche. So I don't see that there is a particular gap that, that technology is filling. I think it's more of a specific niche. Review is where we see the most opportunity and we've got a strong position there.
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just wanted to follow-up, again, on the logic order question at 14-nanometer. Do you get the sense that higher logic spend at 14-nanometer to address this defect density issues is all accounted in your 2014 view, again with the process intensity growing to 15% to 16%? Or do you get the sense of growth beyond that as we get into 2015, which is when the foundry has really hit the FinFET spend.
Richard P. Wallace: In 20 -- or just in terms of logic spend, we had a very strong first half of the year in logic. Now we tend to get more lead time in logic. So it's not -- it's consistent with our forecast that we haven't seen a lot -- we didn't see a lot of orders in the September quarter and don't expect that much in December. I think as we progress into next year though, I think as the 14-nanometer ramp starts to play out and planned out, I think that we'll see it pick up then. I mean, it's always interesting whenever we hear these little data points or these or announcements around, well, CapEx is up or CapEx is down or we're having these issues. We work pretty closely with our customers, and so within -- around the logic space, we're pretty tight in terms of their plans around yield management and process control. So we don't necessarily see these blips in business associated with an error there.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Maybe I can follow up then on the gross margin progression that you're going to likely see on all these new tools. I mean how should we think about modeling cost of goods sold from these products shipped but not recognized for sales? Is there perhaps a step function increase in gross margin in the March quarter when the revenue show up?
Richard P. Wallace: No. I don't think it's going to be all that different than what we have seen historically. And that's why I made the comment about, from an incremental gross margin perspective, the 60% to 70% model is how you ought to be thinking about it. Certainly, in any given quarter, we'll have mix issues that will drive us over or under that range or the higher end or lower end of that range. I mean, one of the things that's encouraging is we are starting to see a bit of a pickup in the mash-up segment of reticle inspection here going forward. And that's a more favorable mix product for us that has been pretty weak over the last several quarters. So I think as that comes in, I think we feel pretty good about the mix overall and the margin performance. And assuming we can manage our product transitions well and minimize our inventory exposures, I think we should be fine.
Operator: Next question is from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions, Rick. If I look at your foundry orders based on the guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like your foundry orders for calendar '13 could be down somewhere in the vicinity of, say, 15% year-over-year. We've all known that the foundries are supposed to be the highest in terms of the process control intensity. I'm just trying to reconcile where are we wrong here and how was the trend going to shake out in 2014, given all the industry inflections in the foundry next year? And I have a follow-up.
Bren Higgins: So this is Bren, I'll start, and then Rick can come in if there's anything to add here. So yes, foundry in calendar '13 was a little bit weaker for us so I think your numbers are about right. We're seeing the orders here starting to pick up now here in the second half. And I think it bodes well for what we expect in '14 where we think foundry should be solidly up next year to drive the 10% kind of growth that we expect. I think when we think about next year right now, memory is probably flattish for us, right? Maybe a little bit up, but with foundry picking up and logic may be up as well. So...
Richard P. Wallace: And it's probably true that if you looked at bookings, obviously, that would be true. If you look at revenue, probably a slightly different story because a lot of what we saw in '13 was revenue that came for foundries from orders that were in '12. And so we -- there is kind of this node component of it so that at the beginning of 28, we would see some strength and then you kind of hit an air pocket until you get to 20, which is what we're starting to see some of now we think that picks up. So it's a little bit hard to dissect it on an annualized basis. You really have to look node to node. And that's how we expect, and we are already seeing signs that, that will strengthen as we go into '14.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And then as a follow-up, [indiscernible] backdrop that we all know that spending is going to be up at least 10% year-over-year. [indiscernible] subsegment between inspection metrology and reticle inspection going into next year, given the spending mix that you see, particularly with 3D NAND being extremely process control intensive. so I'm just trying to get a sense from that.
Bren Higgins: Can you repeat the first part of the question? We didn't hear it.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Yes. The first part of the question was that with spending going to be up 10% year-over-year, how should we think about movements that trends between your various segments, i.e. between your wafer inspection metrology as well as reticle inspection between 413 and 414, and given the spending that you're going to see particularly from 3D NAND, which is process control intensive. I'm just trying to get a sense of how directionally the wafer inspection metrology and reticle moves.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, so reticle inspection tends to be a little bit lumpy. So we can probably expect to see that somewhere between sort of the 10%, maybe as high as 15%. But generally, most of -- that is a business that has been a little bit weak. It's starting to pick up again. But -- and I think we'll see investments happen in a given quarter and then it will fall off on follow-on quarters. So I think you can think about it in terms of 10% to 15% range. I think metrology generally is about 15% to 20%. And I think wafer inspection is around 1/2 the business, and that includes high-end pattern inspection on pattern e-Beam and so on.
Operator: Your next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Rick, what is going to be driving the variance in your December quarter booking? Is that by the type of a device manufacturer, foundry versus memory? Or is it more driven by product mix?
Richard P. Wallace: You mean how do we have the range?
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes.
Richard P. Wallace: Both sides of the range or...
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes. What's going to drive having -- you having the low end versus the high end.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. It's less about particular device types and more about customer activity. And as you know, we often have some products that are pretty big in terms of the big impact because the dollar value is high and with those come in or if they don't, that'll swing it. So I think it's less about any particular segment and more just the general variation we see in the bookings environment, given fewer customers that place bigger orders and just if they come in or not. Nothing in particular in terms of device type or projects that we're counting on.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Got it. And then going back to prior commentary on R&D. You emphasized some 450-millimeter-related projects. But how about the EUV en masse inspection? Could you elaborate on your plans? Or how should we think about incremental spending that is needed to get the R&D up and running?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we have investment going now. We'll continue to make that investment. We believe that eventually, there's going to be a need for an [indiscernible] inspector so at EUV wavelengths. We have the capability now in our 6xx platform to satisfy market needs, probably through the 10-nanometer node for EUV. Although it's not ultimately what people want for volume production. It will have -- we'll start seeing delays in our forecasted timed market if we don't ramp inspection investment through 2014. And right now, we're working with customers to determine exactly what the demand is. It's a bit of a waiting game because our customers are feeling, I think, more and more concerned about the insertion point of EUV production. And I'd say in the last few months that the sentiment has been pushing out EUV in terms of its high-volume manufacturing, which means that pushing out and giving sort of more time for the investment. So on the one hand, that'll dampen our investment in our reticle tool, but on the other hand, it creates great opportunity and patterning process control and we're going to benefit from that. So I would say, it's still stay tuned because we haven't secured customer commitment toward the need and the sharing of some of the investment risk of that. And I think that's going to take some time.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Just to make sure that I understand, that incremental investment that you would need to make, that has to do with sub-10 nanometer or you're still not sure on 10-nanometer?
Richard P. Wallace: No, we think that the tool set that we have, the 6xx, can support -- we think that 10-nanometer will be pretty light for EUV production. And so EUV is likely pushing out of 10-nanometer, in which case, customers will be able to, by and large, do what they need to do with the capabilities that we have. But that's not high-volume EUV manufacturing. So we'll need to invest significantly more if we want to have a tool that intercepts high-volume manufacturing EUV, but that continues to be delayed.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Rick, can you just remind us what the incremental increase in capital intensity is in the transition from planar to 3D NAND in terms of process control? And maybe you could go, well, one step below on the inspection side as well?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I don't have it committed to memory. I think, in general, that what we see is that there's a significant CAGR on the increase if you go to 40 nanometers down to some of the 3D stuff. But remember, the adoption rate was low, I think, in the mid-8s. And we're talking about a 30% increase in that adoption as you go to the 3D. And we're seeing some evidence. But again, nobody has really done volume 3D, so nobody really knows for certain. But the initial activity we see from our customers support the thesis that we're going to see increasing demand for process control.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Ben Pang with Northland Capital Markets.
Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: For the foundry node, can you refresh, again, on what the differences are in the capital intensity between 28, 20 and FinFET? And for 2014, for foundries, do you think your opportunity is bigger for 20-nanometer or for the FinFET development? And the last question is, what should we look for, for the tax rate for 2014?
Bren Higgins: All right. I'll start here on the easiest one. I think the tax rate does fluctuate a little bit, but I think for modeling purposes, you should just go ahead and assume 23%, now bridge it to the actual against that number as we go through. But I think that overall, as we model it out, that's a reasonable percentage.
Richard P. Wallace: So on the question of process control intensity, what we laid out at West was that in the logic foundry space that the 2x nanometer, 4x, it was about, we average 15.8% intensity. At 2x, it was 17%. And we saw that at 1x going to 18.4%. So that's really the difference between the 2x would be the planar work and what we see going into the 3D. And so 18.4%. For memory for 3D, we saw that increasing as you go from 8.8% as we said up by about 30%.
Benedict Pang - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division: Do you think in 2014 for the foundries, are you going to sell more of your equipment for 20-nanometer capacity or for FinFET development for foundries?
Bren Higgins: Well, I mean I think a lot of it, to Rick's point, the intensity goes up on a per wafer start basis. So it really gets back to how much capacity ultimately gets added in terms of how many tools are actually purchased, how much we actually end up shipping. So -- but node to node, as Rick mentioned, we see a 30% increase in dollars per wafer starts spent on process control.
Operator: There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Lockwood.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, Chief Financial Officer; and Bren Higgins, Vice President, Finance and Prospective Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2012, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. Given that we've provided a thorough update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then, Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 financials. Let's begin with a quick review of the quarter. Gross bookings in June were $713 million, down slightly from the March quarter. June quarter revenue was roughly flat compared with March at $720 million, coming in above the midpoint of the range of guidance. The non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.82 in Q4, also above the midpoint of guidance. Cash flow from operations was $176 million in Q4, and we were active in returning value to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 1.3 million shares in the quarter for $68 million. For the full year in fiscal 2013, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total of $273 million and paid dividends of $266 million. And finally, as we announced on July 9, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. This is the fifth increase in the quarterly dividend level since it was first instituted in 2005 and reflects management and the board's confidence in the long-term outlook for the company, as well as our ongoing efforts to reward our stockholders for their continued investment. Our performance in Q4 highlights the continuation of the trend of market technology and business model leadership for KLA-Tencor, as the increase in cost and complexity associated with managing yields makes process control increasingly more critical to our customers' success. Against this backdrop, KLA-Tencor is successfully executing our long-term strategic objectives and delivering strong stockholder returns. Turning now to our view of the current business environment. The Q4 bookings profile for KLA-Tencor was highlighted by order strength from memory customers. Memory accounted for 44% of gross bookings in June with several customers delivering upside to their original order forecast in the quarter. We expect memory orders to grow to 55% of our bookings in September with orders to support a large new fab project comprising a significant portion of the mix. We're also experiencing more breadth of demand among DRAM customers to support technology transitions and growth in mobile DRAM. Memory customers are facing increasingly more complex yield challenges at the leading edge, and as a result, we expect to see higher relative adoption of process control and strengthening market share for KLA-Tencor in leading-edge memory, as customers continue to advance their technology roadmaps. Foundry accounted for 33% of new orders in the June quarter. We expect foundry to comprise approximately 35% of September bookings with demand spread across a broad base of customers and focused on ramping leading-edge devices. Because foundries tend to have the highest adopter -- adoption of process control, the sustained level of foundry investment we are experiencing is favorable to KLA-Tencor and a key driver to our market leadership and strong financial performance. Finally, bookings from logic customers represented 23% of new orders in June, driven by continued migration to 14 nanometer. In keeping with our expectation for logic demand to be concentrated in the first half of calendar 2013, bookings from logic customers are anticipated to decline to 10% of the mix in September. Now for some additional perspective on the demand picture for the remaining of the calendar year. We noted at SEMICON West, we expect order levels to strengthen modestly in the second half of 2013 with sustained strong demand from foundries and the growth in memory offsetting a weaker outlook for logic. This is consistent with our view for industry CapEx to be down in the range of 5% to 10% and total revenue for KLA-Tencor to be down in the range of 8% to 10% for calendar 2013. Looking ahead to calendar 2014, although it's too early to quantify with any detail, we're aligned with the widely held view that the 2014 year will be strong for the industry and have significant industry growth, as the factors, which have sustained the high level of CapEx investment in the cycles, remain in place with mobility markets fueling a rapid pace of innovation in next-generation semiconductor devices and driving growth for the market leaders. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We expect September bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $750 million. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $620 million to $680 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.73 in the quarter. With our strong shipment revenue backlog levels and our anticipated order growth in the December quarter, we expect revenue growth to resume in the fourth quarter of calendar 2013. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers.
Mark P. Dentinger: Good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions; restructuring-related charges and credits; and any costs or credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.02 after tax difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. Q4 new orders were $713 million, down from the $738 million in Q3. Q4 net orders were $705 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. 38% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 17% in the March quarter; Europe was 6% of new systems orders, down from 17% in Q3; Japan was 12%, up from 9% last quarter; Korea was 10%, even with last quarter; Taiwan was 10%, down from 35% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 24%, up from 12% in Q3. The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 54% compared with 51% last quarter; reticle inspection was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 20% in Q3; our non-semi businesses were 2%, down from 3% last quarter; and service was 21% of new orders in Q4, up slightly from 20% in Q3. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 33% of new systems orders in Q4 were from foundry customers compared with 47% in Q3; Logic customers were 23% of new orders in Q4, down from 25% in Q3; and memory orders were 44% in Q4 versus 28% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q1 fiscal 2014 will be within the range of $600 million to $750 million. In Q4, we shipped $769 million, up from $694 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $620 million and $680 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased slightly from the end of March, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in systems backlog. Backlog at June 30, 2013, included $271 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $817 million in system orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q4 was $720 million, down about 1% from $729 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q4 was $570 million, down about $10 million from last quarter, and services revenue was $150 million, roughly even with Q3. Our expectation for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $620 million and $680 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.8% this quarter, approximately flat with 57.9% from last quarter. For Q1, we are expecting gross margins between 56% and 57.5%. Operating expenses were $223 million in Q4, up $10 million from the $213 million we posted in Q3. Part of the quarterly net expense increase was attributable to a decrease in reimbursements under our direct write lithography program. More specifically, a $4 million milestone payment, which we had been expected in Q4, is now expected in Q1. Consequently, we anticipate net operating expenses in Q1 will be down slightly from Q4 to a range between $218 million and $222 million. OIE was a net $10.5 million expense in Q4, up slightly from the net expense of $10.1 million in Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of about $10.5 million in Q1. In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $44 million or 24% of pretax income versus the 14% rate in Q3. The unusually low Q3 rate was mostly related to reinstatement of the U.S. Federal R&D tax credit in January. As we move forward, we are forecasting a non-GAAP tax rate of about 23% for fiscal 2014 based upon the anticipated distribution of next year's earnings. The actual rate could differ, especially quarter-to-quarter. But under our current structure, we believe 23% is the midpoint in a range of outcomes, and we have used 23% in our Q1 non-GAAP EPS guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $139 million or $0.82 per share in Q4. At the revenue range I've previously mentioned in applying a tax rate of 23%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.53 and $0.73 per share. Weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q4 was 168.7 million versus 169.2 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of June 30, 2013, we had approximately 5.9 million shares available under our current authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about 168.6 million for Q1. We also paid $66 million in dividends in Q4. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share in Q1. On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.9 billion, up $39 million from March 31. Cash generated from operations was $176 million in Q4 compared with $415 million in Q3. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in cash flow from operations was largely attributable to $155 million decrease in customer collections, as well as higher outlays for trade payables, income taxes and interest on our debt. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $525 million, up from $454 million at the end of March. DSO was 66 days at June 30 versus 57 days at March 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories were $634 million at June 30, down slightly from $650 million at the end of March. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 1.9 turns in Q4, the same as Q3. Capital expenditures were $19 million in Q4, up slightly from $18 million in Q3. Full-time headcount at June 30 was 5,821 versus 5,838 at March 31. We expect our headcount to remain about flat in Q1. In summary, our guidance for Q1 is new orders between $600 million and $750 million, total revenue between $620 million and $680 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.53 and $0.73 per share, applying a 23% tax rate. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open your call up to questions. [Operator Instructions] So Jay, we're ready for your first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of Satya. Just wanted to understand your expectations for the full year revenue a little better. It seems like you are down ticking the revenues for this year to be somewhat underperforming the WFE. So just wanted to understand like what's driving that change.
Richard P. Wallace: All right, I'm going to let Bren take that one.
Bren Higgins: So I think when you look at the second half view, which is essentially consistent with what we said at SEMICON of $1.5 billion in orders, and you flow that through our backlog number and then take the revenue guidance for this quarter, it does lead you to this calendar year view of the calendar revenue down 8% to 10%, so roughly consistent with our expectations for the industry of down somewhere between 5% and 10%. But that's how, as we bottoms up the revenue this quarter to come up with the $650 million and then flow through our backlog model into the December quarter. So that's how the math works.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then thinking about 2014, it seems like 2013, just based on what you're saying for the second half, the memory shipments seem to be up quite a bit. And for -- that could be one reason may be why you're not doing as well as the WFE this year. How should we think about 2014? How do you think relative to the WFE, what do you expect should process control and inspection in KLA be up next year? Or do you think it will be down?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, certainly, we see the memory mix being probably strongest in the quarter that just finished and the September quarter. For us, we see memory kind of reverting back to historical norms than the December time frame, and next year, I think the large -- the expected increase in the overall market will be driven by the traditional drivers of late, which are the logic and foundry, both of which are going to be good for KLA-Tencor. So we think 2014 should be a good year for us and for process control.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, you said at SEMICON that you thought orders were going to be about $1.5 billion during the back half. So if I just take the midpoint of September, that implies you're like $875 million or up 30% sequentially in Q4. Is that sort of the way to think about it?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, Tim, no change to our view of what we think the rest of calendar '13 looks like.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just as you assess maybe some of the stuff going on with respect to your exposure to 3D and to FinFET, as more of that stuff shifts next year, can you again sort of remind us how to think about your exposure to your 3D NAND relative to FinFET? So if we were to try to assume what sort of an impact that might have on your ability to outgrow the industry next year, those 2 factors?
Richard P. Wallace: I think 2014, we will expect to see some 3D NAND, and as we mentioned, we have, we believe, a good position, very good market position when it comes to serving that market, and we do see growth off historical levels for that. And I think there is also a period of investment now basically playing catch-up a little bit on the memory side. So memory will be at a higher level of intensity than it's been in the past driven by that but not as high as it would be if it were a pure foundry and logic. So we kind of go back to the historical -- we think next year looks a little bit more like the 70-30 split in logic and foundry and the 70% in memory on 30% with intensity going up in both.
Bren Higgins: Tim, it's Bren. Just one other thing, so on the order outlook, so at $1.5 billion, if you take the midpoint of the Q1 guidance, that puts the December quarter nominally around $825 million, so up about 20%, up 30% would be a little bit higher than what we see today. So largely unchanged from -- or essentially the same as what we saw at SEMICON.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have a 2-part question. Number one, on the revenue guidance, it seems a little weaker than expected. Is it partly because some of these memory bookings you made is scheduled for shipment in calendar Q4 or later? And the second question I had is, since your kind of visibility into current [ph] -- the December quarter bookings, how would that mix look like if memory comes down? Are you expecting foundry to come in a big way to pick up the slack in December?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, Krish, this is Rick. I'll take Part 2 and then give Bren Part 1. We do see the mix reverting back to the 70-30 mix we talked about at SEMICON West in the December quarter, memory being 30%, most of that, actually, being in the NAND space, as we get out to December. And so logic, we'd see some pickup in logic and foundry to comprise the rest of what we see for the rest of the year. And then Bren can take the revenue for Q1 comment.
Bren Higgins: So Krish, on the revenue guide, so there are a couple of ways to model it from a top-down perspective, but when we give the guidance, what we do is we build it up, bottoms up, tool by tool. And in some cases, you have tools that have acceptance cycles that we have to go all the way to product acceptance to take revenue, which impacts timing. And then other tools, sometimes you can take that revenue in shipment. So as we build it up and go through that process and look at it, we come out at about $650 million. So when you look at the overall model, lead times are still roughly what they've been. We're averaging about 4 months from order to shipment and about 1.5 months in terms of shipment to revenue. So that's how it works. So sometimes, you can end up with some disconnects from a top down versus bottoms up. But as we build it up for the current quarter, which is our process, that's where we end up.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of the Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Rick, you mentioned memory intensity is going up. Can you talk about your expectations of process control intensity in the memory sector as you look into the next couple of quarters? And how much of the impact on revenue could be attributed to share shifts? I mean, in other words, can you say that your overall market share this year is going to be flat, up, down versus last year?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. Let me start with the memory question. What we laid out at SEMICON, and we have no reason to change it now, is memory intensity at the 4X node we saw about -- in aggregate -- about 8.8%. With it going to 9.3% -- this is process control intensity and memory at 2X and 10.2% on the 1X. And so what we're seeing now is depending on who's buying that increase in [ph] intensity, but it's -- that averaged over time. And what happens is much is the same in the case with logic or foundry, you see it may be heavier at the beginning of a ramp and lightening up as you go later into a ramp. So there are some increased buying. There are some increased buying now because at the beginning of some new fab activity and new ramps. That's part of why we're seeing a heavier concentration of memory right now. But over time, we think it normalizes to those percentages that we laid out. And the other question was on share. Our expectation, we just did the analysis. We finished our fiscal year. We looked back, and we did not see a meaningful change in market share in terms of dollar spent on process control for KLA-Tencor as a percent of what we noted the overall spend. And as we look forward, we don't anticipate any change in that, in our plans for the upcoming fiscal year. And we do think there are actually some opportunities for share improvement.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Rick, just wondering if you could share your view on how much you think 2014 WFE spending should be up. Are you kind of estimating at least double-digit growth? And then do you think foundry CapEx spending will be up again next year?
Richard P. Wallace: As you know, Stephen, it's really hard to predict. I went back in time, and I was looking at August predictions, and well, it was a bad year to pick it. But 2008 and some of the leading equipment companies were saying 2009 was going to be up 10%. That didn't happen as you recall. So I think the perils of long-term forecasting are still with us. But assuming there's no macroeconomic changes, we do see '14 looking better primarily driven by the transition toward that 20/16-nanometer nodes in the foundry section continue to invest in logic and memory returning to maybe more historical levels of investment driven by some of the activities in the VNAND and the better pricing in DRAM. So all in all, we're kind of sitting with the rest of the industry in terms of industry consensus on what we think '14 will look like. We think we're going to start seeing some of that increased activity, as we said, in the December quarter, supporting what we believe will be a pretty good year in 2014.
Operator: The next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, you talked quite a bit at the SEMICON on the competitive front on what's going on. I mean, there is, of course, a lot of talk about the market share movements. Can you update us a little bit more on brightfield inspection? You talked about that we're at the trailing-edge [indiscernible], and there is some movement. As we see the 20-nanometer orders, are we going to see a big pickup in your share in terms of brightfield inspection?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. Let me start with the one of things that was brought to my attention as we were reviewing last year. We had a record shipment year for brightfield in our fiscal 2013, so all-time record for the fiscal year. And as we look forward for 2014, our fiscal '14 starting now, we see continued opportunity for brightfield as we look at some of the challenges being faced by customers in the 20- and 16-nanometer transitions and also some of the activity that's going on, as I said, the renewed investment going on in memory. So we feel very good about our position there and think we'll continue to show strength. And as I mentioned, the NanoPoint discussion that we had at SEMICON West, we're actually seeing more positive examples of that coming out even as recently in the last couple of weeks with customers, so feel very good about our position in the broadband inspection of brightfield.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And one quick follow-up on the memory, I think you mentioned, but I'm not sure that I got exactly. Can you tell us that, in terms of in the memory, how is the composition between DRAM and NAND changing from June quarter to September to December quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we had -- in June, it was about 60% of the memory was for NAND, and it looks to be about that for September. I don't actually have it modeled for the December quarter at this point but roughly, 60-40 for NAND versus DRAM, which is good to see DRAM actually investing at that level. It had been much higher in the past, and -- but there is some catch-up going on in DRAM.
Operator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Rick, I have a rather philosophical question. When I talk to technologies, both in the memory and also logic, the guys who are in the field, they're actually doing the design for circuit chip or working on the process technology. I hear conflicting things on the sense that, as was captured last night by Cadence Design, there are just not a whole lot of design activity. And if I were to assume that EDA companies are leading indicator, they're not seeing a whole lot of volume until 2015. And when I talked to technologies on the NAND side, nobody sees commercialization of 3D NAND until '15 or '16. So I want to hear your opinion as to what gives the confidence that in this kind of environment, CapEx next year could be really great.
Richard P. Wallace: All right. Well, in terms of the investment -- let me start with the second one. What we've seen on 3D, people are absolutely building fabs, ordering equipment and talking about need for increased stability to support those RAMs [ph]. Those are the signals that we're getting and some of the business that we got in the June quarter and we expect to get the next 2 quarters is in support of that. And there's a lot of activity in terms of people moving to support that, customers, multiple customers making investment there. So whether or not there's a demand for it, I actually have heard differing views that there is actually a pretty strong demand for the 3D coming from some new consumer markets and the challenge, I think, will be to ramp and meet that on the new technology. And that's -- we're feeling that pressure to support those ramps right now. So it's as real as any kind of ramp pressure that I've felt in the past -- people wanting, customers wanting very explicit support plans because sometimes they're in new locations. In terms of the FinFET, I do think that the question of how long the 20-nanometer node lasts is a very good question. And we are seeing some evidence that there are customers that are going to skip to 16 and 14 because they feel that either that they're not necessarily going to benefit enough from going to 20, and they're going to move beyond that. I don't know that the mix is going to be incredibly high initially. I think that there are probably not as many starts, so maybe there's some -- that, that may be somewhat consistent that it's a limited number of devices on those. But that is not atypical for a new node ramp. So we are definitely hearing very similar conversations from customers. The ones that are later in the process of 28 nanometers, I think will come later. But the ones that are further along and are in their 20-nanometer, maybe higher volume at this point are definitely pushing us toward preparing for the next generation. So it may be true, but it's certainly not the signs. In fact, I'd say that the memory thing has surprised us in terms of how much investment is going in, in some cases, to brick and mortar to prepare for what they believe is a strong customer demand.
Operator: The next question comes from Srini Sundararajan with Summit Research.
Srinivasan Sundararajan: Rick, this is Srini and just wanted to ask you as to whether you see any differences between the FinFET in the 28-nanometer node and maybe in the 14-nanometer node or the 20-nanometer node. What are the differences as you go down in the node size?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, the differences for us, so I'm not a device physicist, so I'm not going to be able to tell you the differences in terms of challenges performance wise, but -- or leakage wise. But what we're definitely seeing is 28-nanometer in some customers is much more mature than others. So I would start by saying that there are some customers much further along on the yield curve. There are others, by the way, who are still struggling with the yield on 28 and working very hard, and we're seeing good opportunity from those customers who try to get them up and yielding. On the next generation, I think that the tolerances are all very, very tight for people. So we're seeing a strong push toward next-generation inspection and measurement tools from us to be able to handle the increased, I guess, process and tolerance if you will. And that's what's driving us right now. We have very tough specs coming from customers that are going down that path, and it's resulting in us having to sell our latest generation equipment to serve that. So I think it's a refresh cycle. The things that -- or the products that we're going to make to support 16 and 14 are going to be the leading edge that we have now. I think they'll be very little of the trailing edge in those nodes on those critical layers because the requirements are just too high but from a defectivity standpoint and a metrology standpoint.
Operator: The next question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just wondering real quickly, you had mentioned there you see some opportunities for share improvement, and I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail. I know that in the past you mentioned that NanoPoint might help with potentially some e-Beam review traction. But is that one of those opportunities? And are there others that you might like to highlight?
Richard P. Wallace: I think we've got some pretty good opportunities. I mentioned NanoPoint. I think we have some good opportunities in terms of films. And actually, it might be surprising, but I think there are some good opportunities in reticle, and that's an area where, historically, we had some strong share, has not been quite as strong recently partly because we've been toward the end of -- not end, but we're in a mass-maker holiday a bit, not pushing mass technology as much as you do double and quad patterning. And some of the new challenges on some of the advanced reticles are, once again, taxing technology and really play to our strength as technology leaders. And so we think there's a reasonable likelihood we'll actually see share gain in reticle as reticle starts investing again as we go forward. Also, we found some customers recently that felt that they had strategies where they could limit their adoption of reticle potentially even in the fab, and they've had -- been burned by some problems recently, and they're coming to us for some solutions. So we feel pretty good about the opportunities there.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. That's helpful. And then just on the NanoPoint piece, you mentioned some good revenue growth opportunity, and I'm wondering how NanoPoint plays into that in terms of the revenue from it being an add-on option versus it driving incremental demand in e-Beam and brightfield.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I wouldn't stress the revenue from NanoPoint as much. I think that what NanoPoint does is it creates additional value, so we talked a lot about it at West in terms of what it was doing for brightfield, and I just mentioned earlier on the call, when we tallied up FY '13 and just finished, we had a record year in brightfield for the -- all-time record for the company. And I know that part of that was driven by some of the adoption of NanoPoint. And when it comes to e-Beam, it's more substitutional. I think there are some customers that -- and this is part of what's driving it with brightfield is that they were feeling that some of the defects that they were looking for, they could only really find them with e-Beam. And even though e-Beam had incredibly slow throughput, that was the only thing they could do. And with NanoPoint, to a number of those customers, we demonstrated the ability to leverage a much, much faster brightfield tool in conjunction with NanoPoint to take over those inspection points. And I think the result is more adoption for brightfield and frankly squeezing some of the opportunities that e-Beam had been seeing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Rick, 2 questions. First, given the intensity of edge and deposition steps in 3D NAND and yields unproven, how would you characterize that yield ramp? Is it you have a foundry ramp that you have seen where people have stumbled on 28 nanometer? I'd like to get your thoughts on the yield RAM [ph]. And how incremental would be the opportunity on 3D versus 2D NAND? And I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. I think that one thing I did learn more about, I'd say, since West is that -- SEMICON West, is it does appear that there's prettier progress being made by some leading customers on VNAND and I think that it does create opportunity. So I think some of the question about will their investment materialize, I think it's -- there's some evidence to suggest that they're making progress and it's creating a lot of opportunity for us because a lot of the help we're being asked to provide is to assist in those RAMs [ph]. So I think we're past maybe some of the parametric challenges and into actual defectivity. So I think a pretty good opportunity, although it's a different challenge process-wise, so we don't really know yet what we don't know in terms of how our customers are going to use the tools. So we're seeing good opportunity there. And I think that relative to 2D, it's just different because it uses some different technologies to get at the high-aspect ratio structures. And you had a follow-on?
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Yes, I have a follow-on. So how should we be thinking about your logic orders in calendar '13 versus calendar '12 in terms of is there going to be any year-over-year improvement in that segment? Can you give us some clarity on that?
Richard P. Wallace: For calendar '13 -- yes, we're not really modeling out as much as we finish the calendar year. That'd be forecasting more into December than, I think, we're comfortable doing. But I don't think we see -- in average, not a big change.
Bren Higgins: Down probably a little bit at this point, but again, a lot that -- a lot of time to cover here before we get to the end of the year.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Because the reason was that one of your customers are -- key customer's going to start ramping 14 nanometer, and I just wanted to get the magnitude of how we should be thinking about it.
Richard P. Wallace: Right.
Bren Higgins: We had a strong first half in logic, so -- and we tend to get longer lead times in logic, so that certainly supported the first half of the year. So expect it down a little bit in the second half but on the strong first half.
Operator: The next question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Just to follow-up on a prior question, can you just discuss the inspection challenges associated with 3D NAND? I've heard that it's incredibly more difficult to inspect these devices because the way they're built. Can you just discuss whether in fact the -- these chips or this 3D NAND can be inspected?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, they can be inspected. It's different though because now we're looking in a vertical direction. So part of that attraction of 3D NAND is you can back off the dimensions, so you're not printing -- the lines and spaces aren't as small, but they're going vertical. So instead of just looking for smaller and smaller defects, which would push, in one axis, the performance, you're actually looking for defects in the vertical direction, which pushes another axis. Fortunately, our tools have enough flexibility in them to be tuned to do those kinds of inspections. And then there's the review challenge, and then there's the corrective action. So we are finding, as we work with our customers, that we're able to create methodologies with them that help them address some of these defectivity challenges. But they're just different than what you would see if you were just in straight, linear scaling on a 2D device.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Limited, Research Division: Okay. Great. And just a second question, quickly, just what are your expectations for timing of sort of 16-nanometer FinFET or 14-nanometer FinFET from the foundries in terms of spending there?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we expect to start seeing investment toward the end of the calendar year, and then, I think throughout 2014, there should be continued investment as the leaders are followed by other close -- fast followers behind them. We'll see continued investment through the year in '14.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So first question on the memory customers, right? I think you mentioned that you're seeing a broadening of customer spending. But at the same time, I take your commentary on the back half and how it imply for the fourth quarter, you kind of imply your memory order could potentially be down even though you have one big customer that plans around [ph] a new fab. Can you help reconcile those for me?
Richard P. Wallace: Our lead times tend to be longer than others.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I see. I see. So basically, a lot of orders already come in right now in the horizon [ph]?
Richard P. Wallace: We talked about it being strong in September as well.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I see. Okay, that's fair. And then one quick question on gross margin. This quarter goes on and came in above your guidance range, and I remember last quarter was something due to the revenue, timing of revenue that allows you guys to have stronger margin. What happened this quarter? And why are you guiding for September gross margin go back to that 56% to 57.5% range?
Bren Higgins: I think, incremental gross margins in Q4 were pretty consistent with our model at about 67%. So revenue was largely flat, and as you know, with our products, we always end up with a fair amount of puts and takes around the mix. But with mix being sort of largely flat in the quarter from our guidance, we ended up with a little bit better factory utilization on the stronger output in the second half, and service and warranty and things like that were favorable as well. That's how we got the incremental point from the guidance.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just a quick question in terms of the R&D spend, the tick-up a bit this quarter. First, in terms of -- is there any -- can you give a little bit of granularity in terms of where that spending may have been targeted whether it's for $450 million or just for continued product development? And secondly, how do you expect it to trend at least in the first half of the year, calendar year of next year?
Bren Higgins: Yes, Patrick, so I've been saying for a while that the OpEx range was going to be somewhere between $215 million and $220 million, and we've been bouncing around within that range. Programmatic swings have caused it to be a little bit under. in the last couple of quarters, it has been, but there was always sort of this possibility that it could be over that, too. We guided about $218 million, $219 million back in April. We came in at $223 million, but as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a milestone related to a cost-sharing plan we have with the government that slipped out of the quarter. So that drove this incremental $4 million or so from our guidance. As we look out going forward, I think we're probably, as we size our FY '14 based on our expectations here around the second half of the calendar year and in an improving environment in the calendar '14, we're sizing that company somewhere around $880 million, let's say, plus or minus $10 million. So works out in that range of around $220 million or so a quarter. But we could have some fluctuation here and there around it. You mentioned $450 million. $450 million is in the number. We've been pretty consistent in terms of our expectations around that spending. It's roughly be between $50 million and $60 million a quarter that we're -- or $50 million to $60 million for the year that we're going to spend, and that's largely the same as what we saw last year as well. So no incremental uptick related to $450 million in our plans at least over the next 12 months.
Operator: The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, I just wanted to ask another question here. I was just looking at your memory order guidance for September, and you're going to be back up to peak absolute memory order levels, back into 2007 type of dollar numbers. And back then, there was a lot of capacity added by the industry. I know that this time, it's a bit different because this is a new technology. It's going to actually take it time to ramp. But there's this prevailing wisdom that it's going to be so different this time. And I guess, it just seems to sort of fly in the face of that, particularly given your commentary that maybe there's another company in Korea that's actually readying plans to build out 3D as well. So can you just maybe, from just a super high level, talk about how the memory companies are acting this time and if it really is going to be a lot different?
Richard P. Wallace: Tim, you would have noticed that, that's [ph] level memory. Well done. We're noticing that, too. This one's a little different though because I think it's front-end loaded at the beginning of a fab ramp with new technology. So there's no reuse really because there's nothing -- the product mix that we have for dealing with the new technology is all new. So there's no ability for people to reuse. But it is largely, for us, going to be front-end loaded towards the beginning of a ramp. So that's why we see it reverting to normal back in the -- or more traditional 30%-ish in the December quarter, but that's really what that's related to. We could and we believe we will see, as other companies come on line, additional opportunity for us but again, likely front-end loaded and probably, over time, reverting to the process control intensities for memory that we saw that we outlined at West. Now the one difference is we don't really know yet what 3D problems customers are going to have, and I don't believe they know yet just how much process control they're going to need. So it looks like a good beginning, but we may be being a bit conservative on the opportunity there as we go forward.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. I turn the call back over to the presenters.
Ed Lockwood: All right, thank you, Jay. I'd like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team for joining us here today. A reminder that an audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later this afternoon. And once again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2013. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. The March quarter results for KLA-Tencor were in line with the company's expectations. New bookings in the March quarter were $738 million, down about 3% compared with December. Orders were concentrated among our foundry and logic customers, with particular strength from logic customers in the period. Third quarter revenue was $729 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.01 per share, applying an effective tax rate of 14%, resulting from a onetime R&D tax credit taken in the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.89 at our modeled tax rate of 24%. So a good start for KLA-Tencor in calendar year 2013 following a year of very strong relative performance for the company in calendar 2012. In fact, according to Gartner's recently published industry report, KLA-Tencor sustained its strong relative market position in calendar 2012, in an environment in which overall process control market revenues were flat in 2012 and the industry CapEx was down approximately 10%. These results highlight a continuation of the trend we've seen in this cycle of increasing adoption of process control, as the mobility markets fuel growth in foundry and logic demand and the increasing cost and complexity associated with managing yields makes process control critical to our customer success at the leading edge. Turning now to our view of the current business environment. Consumer demand for mobile technology continues to be the primary force behind semiconductor industry demand, with strong smartphone and tablet unit growth, competition and increasing device cost and complexity driving our markets today. For KLA-Tencor, the Q3 bookings profile was highlighted by strength in logic demand, with these customers accounting for 25% of bookings in March. We expect logic orders to comprise 32% of our orders next quarter and to be strong into the second half of calendar year 2013, though below first-half levels. Foundry customers accounted for 47% of new orders in March. We expect foundry orders to comprise 35% of the orders next quarter. And our foundry customer forecast for the second half of 2013 show growth over the first half of the year, with more breadth of demand among these customers. Because foundries tend to be the highest adopters of process control, the sustained high level of foundry investment we've experienced is favorable to KLA-Tencor and a key contributor to our strong relative performance. Finally, orders from memory customers represented 28% of total orders in March, nearly double the percentage from the December quarter. We expect that memory will be 33% of new orders in the June quarter and that memory demand will strengthen in the second half of calendar 2013. Although we are not currently forecasting significant capacity investment for memory customers in the year, we're encouraged by signs of higher relative adoption of process control and strengthening market share for KLA-Tencor among the leading-edge memory customers. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, our outlook for the industry CapEx investment in the year has moderated somewhat from our initial commentary in January, as our customers adopt a more measured outlook for new wafer capacity investment in the near term and prepare for the next node. We believe some of the major factors impacting the timing of equipment demand in the near term include uncertainty in the potential magnitude and breadth of participation among fabless customers for the 20-nanometer node, challenges associated with the transition from planar to 3D device architectures and a persistently weak global economy. As a result, our current market outlook, for modest incremental improvements in overall equipment demand in the second half of the year driven more by the breadth of foundry demand, sustained levels of investment from logic and a strong resurgence of demand from Korea, both for logic and memory applications. That said, given the factors I just mentioned, our bias today is for industry CapEx in 2013 to trend toward the lower end of our original down 5% to 10% range for the year. The driving force behind KLA-Tencor's market leadership continues to be our focus on the customer. With each successive generation of new technology, our customers are facing increased process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirements. Process control is on the critical path to successful management of these complex technical challenges. And as the market leader, KLA-Tencor is positioned to continue to benefit from strong relative adoption of inspection and measurement technologies, as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology roadmaps. Turning now to guidance for the June quarter. Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $625 million to $775 million. Revenue in the June quarter is expected to be in the range of $670 million to $730 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.66 to $0.86 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges and credits and any cost or credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.03 after-tax difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. Q3 new orders were $738 million, down slightly from $760 million in Q2. Q3 net orders were $736 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 17% of new systems orders in Q3, down from 33% in December quarter; Europe was also 17% of new systems orders, up 1% -- up from 1% in Q2; Japan was 9%, up from 7% last quarter; Korea was 10%, down from 13% last quarter; Taiwan was 35%, down slightly from 39% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 12%, up from 7% in Q2. The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 51% compared with 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 6%, down from 10% last quarter; metrology was 20%, up slightly from 19% in Q2; our non-semi businesses were 3%, even with last quarter; and service was 20% of new orders in Q3, the same as Q2. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 47% of new systems orders in Q3 were from foundry customers compared with 67% in Q2; logic customers were 25% of new orders in Q3, up from 16% in Q2; and memory orders were 28% in Q3 versus 17% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for fiscal Q4 will be within a range of $625 million to $775 million. In Q3, we shipped $694 million, up from $673 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $740 million and $800 million in Q4. Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from the end of December, and we ended the quarter with about $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2013, included $218 million of revenue backlog, or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $880 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q3 was $729 million, up 8% from $673 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q3 was $580 million, and services revenue was $149 million. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $670 million and $730 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 57.9% this quarter, up from 55.1% last quarter. The major contributors to the quarter-over-quarter improvement in the gross margin percentage were higher systems revenues and lower reserve requirements. For Q4, we are expecting gross margins between 56% and 57.5%. Operating expenses were $213 million in Q3, almost even with the $214 million we posted in Q2. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be up between $3 million and $7 million from Q3. OIE was a net $10.1 million expense in Q3, up about $1.7 million from Q2. Most of the quarter-over-quarter increase in OIE was due to a gain on the sale of a nonoperating investment during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of about $10 million in Q4. In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $28 million or 14% of pretax income versus 29% rate in Q2. The Q3 rate drop was mostly due to the current quarter and catch-up effect from the reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit in January. Our estimate for the non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 is about 24%. Non-GAAP net income was $171 million or $1.01 per share in Q3. Using our planning tax rate of 24%, our Q2 EPS would have been $0.89. At the revenue range I previously mentioned and applying our tax rate of 24%, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.66 and $0.86 per share. The weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q3 was 169.2 million versus 169.1 million in Q2. During Q3, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2013, we had approximately 7.1 million shares available under our current authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about 169 million for Q4. We also paid $67 million in dividends in Q3. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in Q4. On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.9 billion, up $301 million from December 31. Cash generated from operations was $415 million in Q3 compared with $77 million in Q2. The significant improvement in quarterly cash flow from operations was largely attributable to an increase of $190 million in customer collections, as well as lower outlays for trade payables, income taxes and interest on our debt. In all likelihood, Q4 operating cash flow will revert to a more typical result. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $454 million, down from $606 million at the end of December. DSO was 57 days at March 31 versus 82 days at December 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories were down $13 million from Q2 and ended the quarter at $650 million. Inventory turnover, based upon GAAP cost of revenues, was 1.9 turns in Q3, slightly higher than 1.8 turns in Q2. Capital expenditures were $18 million in Q3, up slightly from $17 million in Q2. Full time headcount at March 31 was 5,830 versus 5,816 at December 31, 2012. We expect our headcount to remain about flat in Q4. In summary, our guidance for Q4 is new orders between $625 million and $775 million, total revenue between $670 million and $730 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.66 and $0.86 per share, applying a 24% tax rate. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open the call up to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So Jay, we're ready for the first question.
Operator: Our first question comes from Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess I was wondering, there is a slight bit of disconnect between what you guys are guiding for the year and what we saw from one of your peers yesterday, and also, what you're looking into June. Is this a segment concentration-type situation that's going on? Or are there any market share changes that's happening that's affecting your outlook?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, Satya, it's Rick. I don't see any particular segment different. I think there is just a matter of perspective on the year. When we look out and talk to customers, we do see some improvement in the second half, but still we see, as we said, a little bit trending down based on all the factors we cited. I think that if you go case-by-case, I think you got -- memory is technology, but not a lot of investment for capacity. I think foundry continues to be relatively strong, and we'll see logic probably continuing, although probably cooling off a little bit in the second half. And that's how we roll up to the annual. As far as share, our share continues to be very strong. I think that we see, from overall perspective, some opportunity actually to gain share this calendar year. We've got some really strong product positions and making pretty good investments in close collaboration with our customers. So we don't see share overall for KLA-Tencor to be a -- and obviously, you have to work for it, but we're not modeling any share loss through this year. And as we talked about last year, we actually did quite well in share, 2012.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen and Company.
Timothy M. Arcuri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to dive into that a little more because there's just such a difference between what you're saying and what others are seeing. Rick, do you think that there's been any change in your view that process diagnostic is still 15% of wafer fab? Is there -- can you maybe discuss what could push that up from here and what might be pushing that down, if only in the short term?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, Tim. I think that the -- I guess, overall, we model memory to be improving in terms of adoption of process control, but not at the level of what we see for foundry and logic. So the degree there is a mix change in the near term that would mean that process control, overall, would probably not see as much appreciation as somebody that was more exposed to memory. However, for the -- overall, for the year, we think that foundry continues to invest, although the build-out of 20 nanometers is -- largely people are making those investments, but we think that will possibly be light participation, with more customers gearing up for the transition to below 20, whether it's 16 or 14, depending on who. So yes, there is a bit of a mix in the near-term scenario, but long term, overall capital intensity for foundry is, I think -- probably we're modeling it pretty consistent with others. And I think that process control for foundry continues to be very strong.
Operator: Next, you have a question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, just to follow up on that. Your foundry booking for June quarter looks like it could be the lowest over the last 3 years. And is it just purely a timing issue? Or do you see your foundry customers actually stalling the spending because of the planar/FinFET transition? Or maybe you've not decided which way to go?
Richard P. Wallace: No, I think right now, what we're seeing is, in the June quarter, that we do see some -- a bit of pause in some of the foundry business. There is another factor, which maybe we talked about in the prepared remarks and I can address a little bit. We did guide shipments to be quite a bit up in this quarter, up to in the $740 million, $800 million. And part of what that is, is there are a number of tools in that, that are early in the development and that will -- it will take us a little while to revenue -- recognize those. And those probably will not fall into the June quarter. And in some cases, what we're looking at for those tools is those are more oriented towards future development process technology nodes. So there may be investment leading into the FinFET development in the foundry space that maybe offsets that a little bit, but we don't expect to see that necessarily be as large in the June quarter as what we've seen in the last couple of quarters. Then we see resumption of that spending in the later part of the calendar year.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So just to follow up with that. For those developments today that you're saying those are targeting 20-nanometer, are they 14-nanometer and are they specifically for foundry? And I guess on your outlook for the year, are you not factoring in much 20-nanometer investment in the second half of this year?
Richard P. Wallace: No, not a lot of investment on the second half for 20, still some, but I would say a little broader participation. So maybe some of the players that haven't been as active in 20 already will participate, but we're modeling relatively modest on a compared basis. And toward the end of the year, more investment associated with maybe the later phases of 20 and some of the sub-20 work.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a question on your view on the order trends for the second half of the year. It sounds like you said you're still planning for orders in the second half to increase from foundry and also to be up from memory, but logic might be down a bit. So I just want to clarify, despite your more cautious view on CapEx this year, are you still planning for, I guess, total second half orders to be flat or slightly up versus the first half?
Richard P. Wallace: We see second half being better, but I'd say when we modeled earlier in the year and we were -- the bias was a little bit more toward down 5%, our bias for the year is still down, but a little bit toward the down 10%, which I think is consistent with actually most of our peers but one. And what we see in that is that you see a second half comeback, as we said, a little bit more investment happening, primarily on a broad-based foundry investment on the second half. So memory, but not a lot of capacity in memory, more capacity-related, and logic perhaps cooling in the second half. The other thing that affects us a little bit about, too, is we're looking some of the ancillary markets like the wafer manufacturers, which we have not seen a lot of investment out of them. And historically, if you look at past cycles, we would have seen more investment out of our wafer guys. We just don't see that happening and that's usually an early indicator overall capacity buys. So we don't see it happening and that kind of aligns with our thinking of overall trends for the year.
Operator: Next, we have Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Rick, I just wanted to get a sense from you. You made comments around second-half growth in the foundry bookings, but just wanted to understand the magnitude of upside or growth that you are expecting. If you look at the first-half bookings run rate, I mean, your bookings would have to almost double in order for overall bookings to be down slightly compared to last year. So I'm just wondering what kind of magnitude of bookings growth you are expecting in the second half.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, well, obviously, we don't guide beyond the quarter. But I can tell you, as we model the overall year and you can do the math, as you said, on how you look at it, as you model the overall year, we think the capital intensity investment for the industry is, on a relative basis, pretty flattish. The overall CapEx, down anywhere from flat to down 10%, and we're saying it's more the down 10%. But we do see mix coming back a little bit and a little bit strength in the foundries and -- breadth in the foundries and strength in memory. And so that's kind of how we get that memory more on technology than on overall capacity buys at this point. And logic, flattish but maybe a little bit more first-half loaded than the second half. And obviously, if you want to walk through the models, our guys can do that with you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Rick, your September quarter has historically been a down quarter given how your fiscal year ends in June. Given the kind of picture that you painted us -- painted for us, and I appreciate all the details and sincerity, how should we think about seasonality and historical trend playing into the September quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Again, that's -- I appreciate the desire to get that. We don't have a good view of September right now. We're still working on finalizing what June looks like and that's why there's such a large range on there. I'd also offer that at SEMICON West, we'll have a much better picture and be able to talk in more detail. But you're right, we do view -- September, historically, has been seasonally softer for K-T, and counterbalanced by what's often a very strong end to the calendar year. So we don't know exactly where we're going to get it in the calendar year quarter-by-quarter, but we're modeling. If we see this overall CapEx down 10%, then it kind of fits with our thesis that process control at least hold our overall intensity and probably outperform, but it'll come later in the calendar year.
Operator: Next, we have a question from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, so in terms of your incremental minus 5 to -- flat to minus 5 to flat to minus 10, is there one specific segment which has -- you've become more incrementally more cautious on?
Richard P. Wallace: What we really haven't seen is any strength in the non -- in the stuff that's outside of the core, so some of the manufacturers of wafers, for example. We do see that, overall, being softer. And the first half is probably lower than we thought it would be in January, and so that -- you still have some comeback in the second half, but it won't compensate for some of the softness we're seeing now.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And one more question is, I mean, how much of your -- the difference between you and your competitors, is timing of ordering. I see that your guidance is pretty similar to lithos, where the guidance for the full year is down, whereas I think the depth and edge, those segments seems to be stronger. Is there some kind of a timing issue that litho and process control order has happened earlier and there is probably some capacity out there, and there's more of capacity orders right now that's making some of your competitor looks better?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, there's certainly -- there are players that are more attuned to capacity buys and the regard -- I would say that it is probably more similar to litho. Our profile looks a little bit like it, but perhaps for slightly different reasons. From our standpoint, it is true that if you look on balance, there is more investment at the very front end of a node than there is on the later parts of the node until they get on to the next node. And that's what we're suggesting is we're seeing more investment continuing and probably phase shifts it a bit. That's not true of all our products, and some of our products are sensitive to capacity and those we do not see a lot of capacity being added, for example, I go back to the wafer manufacturers, but on balance, that's true. The other thing that's happened is we're in a relatively soft period for reticle inspection, which historically would have been stronger through a period of technology development. And that has been softer due to this continuation in double patterning and quad patterning, not stressing the map [ph] shops as much. So that's the other counterbalance to it.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And one final question on ASML suggesting that they have integrated metrology on CD measurement and overlay. And I'm just wondering to what extent that is an additive market or how much of that cannibalizes your overlay market. I think CD measurement is probably not that significant because it's only for FICD. But it's definitely on overlay, you have a very strong market share. I'm wondering if you are seeing any kind of impact in that part of the business.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I think as far as integrated go, customers are interested, and have been for many years, in the concept of integrated metrology, but still not very clear on exactly how to use it. And that comes from the fact that you're then at basically one unit per track step or pair, which is a higher concentration. And it's not clear that that's either economical or feasible from a production worthiness perspective because if it goes down, you can bring down the line. But there is certainly interest in increasing the capability around registration control as people push multiple patterning. So we do think that the market is growing significantly and there is going to be plenty of room for alternative approaches to dealing with that. As far as the CD control, we're actually very happy and have made tremendous progress in terms of market share there, where we did not have a strong position and have recently won planar record buys at a number of key customers for providing optical CD control. So we're really pleased with that part of our business.
Operator: The next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just wanted to -- had a question. There's a view out there, Rick, that 28-nanometer could have more longevity, as customers seem to be at the cusp of deciding on 20-nanometer or sub-16-nanometer by skipping a node. So as they try to debug some of the processes, do you think this flux is causing you to be more biased toward the negative side? And hopefully, if they get more clarity on it, that probably we could see much more uptick from the foundries?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I'd say there's -- Jagadish, very good observation. Two thoughts on that. One is, I think in many ways we're saying the same thing, is that we do see some question about the strength of 20-nanometer based on interest we're seeing in sub-20, which would, by extension, extend the life of 28. The other thing is that even though 28 has been -- there are people that are successful at 28, there's still a broader market, broader participation by other foundries in 28 that creates other opportunities. So we do see some strength in that build-out. And I suspect that there's still some process changes, even on 28, that will create some opportunity for us as well. But yes, that is the question, is how big the participation and how quick people go to 20 or if they skip it or not. Should that change, I think it does improve our prospects for the calendar year.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next, we have a question from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Rick, maybe if you could give a little bit of color in terms of the 3D NAND opportunity and whether you see that transition as being, I guess, an inflection point or a step-up in terms of the memory adoption of more process control, given some of the challenges in that type of manufacturing?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, there's a couple of opportunities that 3D presents and some are less obvious than others. One is, obviously, as you can imagine, trying to find defects requires some new capabilities for people as they deal with 3D. And finding them is just one part of it, then validating that they actually found them. There's been a lot of work going on to try to support customers as they do that, as they try to make that manufacturing process production-worthy. The other thing is there's plenty of opportunity there for some of this optical CD measurement that I talked about, and we're doing well in that regard. The third one is because many of these structures are multilayered within a process tool, there's actually a pretty good opportunity for bare wafer inspection, to make sure that the cleanliness of those tools is at a higher level than historically. So we are seeing increased opportunity for bare wafer inspection to support 3D, which is an additive bonus to -- perhaps counterintuitive to the opportunities of 3D.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Maybe just a real quick follow-up. What kind of percentage in terms of dollar opportunity from what you're doing today in planar versus what 3D could be like, I guess, on a percentage basis of an increase in the TAM?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think if you think about process control intensity being -- I don't want to get into specific numbers, but let's say memory process control intensity is 50% of what foundry is, this probably takes it to 70%, 75% of what foundry is.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: It's B. Riley & Co. now. First, you commented on the capital intensity that memory adoption is not as high as logic and foundry, but isn't the capital spending still much greater than 50% for foundry and logic this year?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. No, overall, that's right. I think that the memory investment for the year is certainly not -- you go back in time and it was actually driving a lot of the CapEx. But we are in a momentary point in time where there's probably, on a relative basis, even for us, we're seeing -- we're looking at June, thinking 33% or 1/3 of our business is going to come from memory. And you have to go back several years to the market split used to be 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And I now I think we're in this temporary phase where memory is 1/3 of what we're going to be in terms of opportunity, which means it's probably more than that of the overall market, and we think that reverts as we get to the second half of the year, which is why we think we'll see more strength in the second half.
Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: And then usually, I think we're always worried about utilization rates for other types of tool. Is there any kind of situation where there was too much buying of your equipment early, like 2012?
Richard P. Wallace: Not really. I mean, I think the question often becomes, can it get redeployed on additional nodes? And so part of what drives our product roadmap is the -- is a slight difference, is you could redeploy inspection and metrology capacity towards advanced nodes with some level of success. So part of our challenge is always to create more capability in the next generation to make a compelling case for customers to upgrade or go to new products. Otherwise, you would see that. You would see the transition of some of that, especially as yields got very high on the older nodes. So I'd say that we are constantly -- and one of the products we just introduced, for example, in NanoPoint, is to extend the capability, provide a motivation for our customers to go to the next-generation technology. And we're seeing that bear out, but usually there's an adoption cycle of that.
Benedict Pang - B. Riley Caris, Research Division: So just to clarify that answer, as my last question. If your tools weren't utilized for the manufacturing node, you'd see more redeployment to the next generation. Is that what I'm hearing?
Richard P. Wallace: It depends how big a transition the technology change is. And for example, 28 to 20 is too big a change. So if they were at 28, they're not going to do a great job at 20, except in the case where they -- it's probably more like litho. The very critical layers on 28 probably correspond better to the non-critical layers on 20, so there will be some. But that cycle has been going on for a while. But even in that case, if you can provide compelling reasons to upgrade, you can often get customers to make the transition.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Lockwood.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Jay. I'd like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team today for joining us. An audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later this afternoon, and once again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Candice, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter fiscal year 2013 conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please begin your call.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Candice. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2012. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. We're pleased with the company's performance in the December quarter, with bookings, revenue and EPS results for Q2 coming in at the upper end or above the range of guidance and marking 2012 as another year of market leadership, differentiated financial performance and high stockholder returns for KLA-Tencor. New orders in the December quarter were $760 million, an increase of 50% compared with the September quarter, with strong foundry and logic demand. Second quarter revenue was $673 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 per share. For calendar year 2012, KLA-Tencor delivered revenue of $3.1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.23. In calendar 2012, we also returned $521 million to stockholders in the form of stock repurchases or dividends. Our dividend payments of $250 million in calendar year 2012 reflect the July 2012 increase in the level of our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. Turning now to our view of the current business environment. Consumer demand for mobility continues to be the primary force behind semiconductor industry demand, with strong unit growth in the mobility markets, competition and increased cost and complexity fueling our markets today. For KLA-Tencor, the Q2 bookings profile featured another period of strong foundry demand, with foundry customers accounting for 2/3 of the new orders in the period. The foundry markets are being driven by mobility. And though current industry projections are for foundry spendings to be flat to slightly down in 2013, the market leader in foundry is forecasting an increase in CapEx for the year, and overall foundry investment remains at a high level. The sustained high level of foundry investment we have experienced in this cycle is favorable to KLA-Tencor and a key contributor to our strong relative performance, as foundries tend to be the highest adopters of process control. Logic was 16% of bookings in December. The logic markets are in a period of transition as growth in mobility markets crowds out the traditional PC markets. We believe the demand for logic customers should strengthen in the first half of the year, reflecting the important role process control plays in improving yields and driving device innovation at the leading edge. Finally, orders from memory customers grew to 17% of total orders in December. We anticipate higher memory bookings in March, but we do not expect memory demand to improve meaningfully until the second half of calendar year 2013. The driving force behind KLA-Tencor's market leadership continues to be our focus on the customer. As our customers execute their investment strategies at the leading edge, each successive generation of new technology is characterized by increased process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirements. Process control is on the critical path to successful management of these complex, technical challenges. And as the market leader, KLA-Tencor is positioned to continue to benefit from strong relative adoption of inspection and measurement technologies as our customers move ahead with their advanced technology road maps. Now for some perspective on our broader outlook for industry CapEx for calendar 2013. As we look ahead to 2013, even though global economic and political uncertainties and cyclical factors present a headwind for growth, we believe the industry demand environment has stabilized, and we see 2013 setting up to be another period of high capital intensity and featuring relatively high foundry and logic investments as a percentage of the total. Our current yield is for the overall industry CapEx to be down in the range of 5% to 10% in calendar 2013, with industry order levels stabilizing in the first half of the year and demand momentum building in the second half of the year. Against that backdrop, we believe KLA-Tencor is well-positioned to continue to benefit from demand trends that have been favorable to the adoption in our core process control markets and help to strengthen our market leadership. Turning now to guidance for the March quarter. Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $700 million to $850 million. March quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $690 million to $750 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.76 to $0.96, assuming an effective tax rate of 18% in the March quarter to account for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges in credits and any cost of credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There is no difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP EPS because excluded pretax expenses, which increased EPS by $0.02 after taxes, were offset by a $0.02 per share discrete tax item. Balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I mention GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available on our website. Q2 new orders were $750 million, up sharply from $506 million in Q1, and Q2 net orders were $740 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 33% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 43% in September quarter; Europe was 1% of new systems orders, down from 13% in Q1; Japan was 7%, down from 13% last quarter; Korea was 13%, down from 20% last quarter; Taiwan was 39%, up from 7% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 7%, up from 4% in Q1. The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 48% compared with 51% last quarter; reticle inspection was 10%, up from 1% last quarter; metrology was 19%, up from 15% in the prior quarter; our non-semi businesses were 3%, down from 4% last quarter; and service was 20% in new orders in Q2, down from 29% last quarter. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 67% of new systems orders in Q2 were from foundry customers compared with 54% in Q1; logic customers were 16% of new orders in Q2, down from 30% in Q1; and memory orders were 17% in Q2 versus 16% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect new orders for fiscal Q3 will be within a range of $700 million to $850 million. In Q2, we shipped $673 million versus $686 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $690 million and $750 million in Q3. Total backlog at the end of Q2 increased by $65 million from September 30, and we ended the quarter with almost $1.1 billion systems backlog. The backlog at December 31, 2012 included $252 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $837 million of systems orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q2 was $673 million, down 7% from $721 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q2 was $523 million, and services revenue was $150 million, which is a record for KT. Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $690 million and $750 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.1% this quarter, down from 56.6% last quarter. The largest contributors to the quarter-over-quarter decline in gross margin percentage were an increase in inventory reserves associated with several product transitions and the continuing modification of our product -- production and service inventory management processes to keep pace with our customers' rapidly changing requirements. For Q3, we are expecting gross margins between 55.5% and 56.5%. Operating expenses were $214 million in Q2, slightly higher than the $211 million in Q1. Most of the increase in operating expenses was due to higher research and development expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were roughly flat with Q1. We expect operating expenses in Q3 to be up between $2 million and $6 million from Q2. OIE was a net $8.4 million expense in Q2, down about $1.6 million from Q1. Most of the quarter-over-quarter decline in net OIE expense was due to a gain on the sale of a nonoperating investment. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense between $9 million and $10 million in Q3. In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $43 million or 29% of pretax income versus a 24% rate in Q1. The Q2 rate increase was largely a function of a change in the estimated distribution of earnings between our U.S. and international locations. We anticipate our rate will decline significantly in Q3, following the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in January. And our best estimate for the non-GAAP tax rate for the fiscal year is about 24%. Non-GAAP net income was $106 million or $0.63 per share in Q2. Using our standard 24% tax rate, our Q2 EPS would have been $0.67. At the revenue range I previously mentioned in defining our planning tax rate of 24%, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.70 and $0.90 per share. At the lower tax rate we are expecting for Q3, our EPS range will be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.96. Weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q2 was 169.1 million versus 169.8 million in Q1. During Q2, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.5 million shares. In November, our board approved an additional 8 million shares for our repurchase program. And as of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 8.4 million shares available under our current authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about 168 million for Q3. We also paid $67 million in dividends in Q2. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in Q3. On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, about even with September 30, 2012. Cash generated from operations was $77 million in Q2 compared with $245 million in Q1. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $606 million, up from $537 million at the end of September. DSOs were 82 days at December 31 versus 68 days at September 30. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factorings. Net inventories were down $27 million from Q1 and ended the quarter at $663 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 1.8 turns in Q2 versus 1.9 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $17 million in Q2, down from $20 million in Q1. Total headcount at December 31, 2012 was 5,816, essentially flat with September 30. We expect our headcount to remain about flat in Q3. In summary, our guidance for Q3 is new orders between $700 million and $850 million, total revenue between $690 million and $750 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.70 and $0.90 per share applying a 24% tax rate and between $0.76 and $0.96 per share using our anticipated Q3 tax rate. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open the call up to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So Candice, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: A couple of them. First off, I think previously, Rick, you were saying that you thought CapEx will be down, closer to 10%, and now you're thinking around 5% to 10%. What segments of the 3, between logic, foundry and memory, has improved the most? And in this environment of down 5% to 10%, what do you think about the outlook for KLA in 2013?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we did see some strengthening recently. Primarily, it looks like foundry is a little bit better than we felt when we had talked about the down 10% to 15% based on some recent news that we've seen. What that means for KLA-Tencor is positive because we do all in foundry and the needs for process control are only increasing as the transition happens to 20-nanometer, which is what's going on in 2013. So we anticipate that we will outperform the industry this year, as we have in the last couple, based on the increasing intensity of process control, plus the mix of customers.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: All right. On gross margins, it was a little light for December related to your guidance and given your -- what came in at the higher end for revenues. I understand the quarter-to-quarter variation, but could you help us go through the effect of the product mix, customer distribution and competition related to your gross margins?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes, Satya, this is Mark. It has less to do with the customer distribution than it simply had to do -- we are going through a pretty active period of product transitions right now, and we built up the inventories somewhat purposely to accommodate that. And when we do, do that, you do get some excess and -- excess demand outcome as a result of that, and we had to take some reserves. Now historically, we tended to get some of those back, but that does take a little bit of time to come back through the system. And we do expect it will digest these and then return to a more normal level in the next quarter or 2.
Operator: Your next question comes from Terence Whalen with Citibank.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: The first question is related to general foundry activity. In terms of the strengthening that you've seen, has that been in the form of pull-ins by customers? Or has it been just an inflation and overall forecast?
Richard P. Wallace: Terence, yes, it's Rick. I think that it's associated with 2 things. One is, I think there is more broad demand, so it's not simply with one customer. We're seeing some strength in others as well. And we do see 20-nanometer. I think the understanding of the challenges associated with 20-nanometer are playing it out. So we believe it's likely that they'll be a differential investment in process control as a result. So I think it's both factors at work.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then the follow-up is to take that a little bit further. When you look at the 20-nanometer node, including 16 or 14 variations, more looking at it planar versus FinFET, is there any way to help us understand what perhaps the requirement increase would be moving to FinFET from planar?
Richard P. Wallace: It's a great question. Unfortunately, it's a rather complicated answer. I think it depends upon a couple of factors. One is, if the companies that are moving forward, in general, have an experience in 3D, then their process control perhaps is better understood and they might be a little less intensive than others that haven't. But we see, in general, increased demand in metrology as one area certainly where 3D drives demand, especially in product lines such as our optical CD and our films measurement tools. We also see a different kind of defectivity concern, which drives adoption, in our case, at the very high-end brightfield inspectors, which is necessary as people are trying to deal with the aspect ratios and the defectivity. We haven't really quantified exactly how much is the increase between 28 and 20. We already see some of the demand. We'd say that probably 1/3 of our orders today are associated for 20 or below. So we're already seeing that start to play out, but we think it will accelerate through the rest of the calendar year as people look at adding more capacity for the 20-nanometer node. Beyond 20, the question of 16 or 14, depending on how you define it, we think there's still investigation as to what's going to be needed, and we're working very closely with customers on that.
Operator: And your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess, first question, Rick, you talked about stabilization of orders in the first half and a pickup in the second half. And I'm just curious, you identified memory as a place that would pick up. But also, I would love to hear your thoughts on how you see foundry trending into the second half, as well as given that large budget we heard from a company down the road from you, how we should see that playing through the model as we exit the year.
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, C.J. I think that when we looked forward, we actually saw some increase -- slight increase. And memory, actually, as a percent of our whole, went up a little bit in the December quarter, and we're anticipating that to continue to grow as a percentage of our total. So we'll see some memory pick up even in March but more pronounced in the second half, and we think that's driven more by technology investment and some capacity in NAND as we get to the second half. Logic, pretty steady in the last couple of quarters. I shouldn't say steady, I should say lumpy but kind of a steady average run rate. We see it at about 25%, 26% for the March quarter and then continue investment through the year. Foundry, actually, we anticipate coming off as a percent, and more in the 50% to 52% range is what we're snapping right now when we look ahead, which is down from the 67% we did. As we go through the year, foundry, I think, is somewhat dependent on overall what happens with 20-nanometer and how many players are really in -- and expanding that. We know there are some activity and some customers, but how that broadens out and the timing of that will influence, I think, whether it's flat or slightly down for the year. We do see some memory strength in logic, I think, pretty steady, maybe some increase in logic, but again, we'll have to see how the year progresses.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Very helpful. And I guess as a follow-up, on the foundry side, Morris [ph] spoke to you, 20-nanometer being a bigger node than 28. And I think there's some confusion as to whether he was talking revenues or clearly wafer prices are much higher or wafer starts. We'd love to get your thoughts on what that kind of node could be like relative to 28 and whether you would include within that the 16- or 20-nanometer FinFET.
Richard P. Wallace: Right. I think it's a big question right now. I think from many of the established guys, they're trying to figure out if they are going to lean in to 20 heavily or if they're going to wait for 16 or 14, depending on what they see as end-demand. I think the other challenge that people have is what the manufacturability is of 20 and how the prices come down. There's certainly a lot of interest. I think that the initial skepticism about the number of customers has reduced. Frankly, I think there's more interest than there was. As far as whether it ends up being bigger than 28, I'm really not in a great position to answer that. I do know that from a process complexity standpoint, there's certainly a lot of concern about the number of processes that are changing, and that's what's driving a lot of our business. But I don't think we're in the best position to answer the actual magnitude of the capacity. I think it depends on a lot of factors. But we certainly see a lot of challenges associated with getting the process under control both from a defectivity standpoint and a process -- overall process control from metrology. So with all the changes with APL, 3D structures and the general scaling challenges, it should be a robust environment for process control and for KLA-Tencor.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: First of all, a cycle question. You guys have been very clear on the cyclical outlook, but the one thing I'm just trying to figure out for modeling purposes. [indiscernible], obviously, you have a very robust CapEx budget. They said of their stated budget, 2/3 of it was first half-loaded and then 1/3 second half. But they certainly held out the possibility that things would pick up in the back half of the year if they did some more for Apple. Incorporated in your guidance for the year in terms of that pickup in the back half, does that assume TSM is coming down on the back half or foundry TSM in particular? Does that assume kind of the more robust budget that they have or maybe the more conservative budget? In other words, is there upside to your forecast if they do wind up spending a little more relative to their commentary around what they would do for Apple?
Richard P. Wallace: We're not anticipating anything beyond what they've said publicly, which is a slight increase. I think they've stated 6% up for their CapEx. So the target mostly, the anticipated, what I've heard them talk publicly about is that, that will be first half, more loaded toward the first half. But I think as we all know, the foundries actually review their CapEx investment strategy more frequently than annually for sure in this environment. So I think it's very hard for us to speculate because our customers don't actually know what they're going to end up doing. We do know that the change, the volatility, the upside of all these great foundry business has been that there's good business for KLA-Tencor and we continue to perform very well in this market. The challenge is that as a result of the volatility and the lack of ability to really forecast, we end up, as a result, having to be more responsive, which impacts some of the things like we've talked already around inventory and our flexibility in operations to support it. But I can't really tell what they're going to do because I think, frankly, our customers are nimble and respond to the market as it plays out. Our overall thesis though is we'll continue to outperform the market, and the general consensus we're getting is a better outlook than we had a few weeks ago even and probably in the range of flat to down 5 right now.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's great. Very helpful. If I could for my follow-up ask, AMAT is once again kind of refocusing on process diagnostics, and this is something that's been around for several decades in terms of them trying to come in and compete with you in this segment. Obviously, they have some new actors that are doing it this time, but they've tried to do this before and it hasn't worked. Do you have any incremental concerns about their ability to penetrate even a little bit of share in this market when you so successfully defended that position so many times over the years?
Richard P. Wallace: I don't underestimate any competitor, and I think it's true that AMAT's got a renewed focus in general. It has caused us, I think -- we take note of all competitors. And certainly, we're in a very attractive space, and people are going to try to penetrate. So we're increasing our level of investment, and I'd say that we are very focused on satisfying our customers. And our strategy is to play our own game and play it -- take it to the next level and respond to customers and continue to invest in our road map. But I absolutely take seriously all competitors and have a lot of respect for the guys over there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, I had a question in terms of metrology. When you look at moving down the technology curve from 28 to 20, is that a trend of the metrology going more in line, especially for the critical steps like lithography where chipmakers are beginning to put it in foundry tools rather than ex situ or you don't see any trends like that?
Richard P. Wallace: Oh, I think there are certain cases where it makes sense to have metrology integrated. I think it ends up actually being a question of process control. And when there's a high-enough variation, then you want to reduce the lag time from the measurement to the correctables. And for a long time, for example, some basic measurements have been made in situ, in places like film thickness and CMP for many years. The question is, can you make the measurements that you need to make and get the feedback quick enough? And is it cost-effective? And do you need to make that frequent of a measurement, depending on how the variation is going? But I certainly think people are always looking for ways to improve their process control, and integrated has always been an idea that people have had. It's interesting because I don't think it's truly in situ. In situ would imply that it's actually in the environment. So the real -- there's only a couple of in-situ measurements that happened, and those tend to happen in chambers or in environments. These are tools that are actually linked to the process equipment themselves, whether it's to the -- often in the case of litho, it'd be linked to the tracks. And so I do think that there are opportunities there, and it's always a question of cost effectiveness against the perceived need, against the impact of reliability and uptime. But it's certainly an area where people have been exploring for a number of years. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's more interest, especially as the design rules create more need for more and more control.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, your memory orders moved up in December, and you're saying it's going to move up further in March. Is it all -- the driver coming from NAND? And if so, what is the breakdown of NAND and DRAM?
Richard P. Wallace: A lot of drivers, NAND, but actually, in the December quarter, it was about 50-50. So we did see some investment associated and primarily in technology-related. And I think for a long time, the memory guys, especially DRAM, have been somewhat on hold regarding investments, and now we're seeing some catch-up. There is an outlook that has NAND increasing and maybe even adding capacity later in the year. Our forecast, for what it's worth, for the March quarter is that it bumps up a little bit higher to 60% of the total memory forecasts. So still not back to levels in the past but certainly off of what was a very low number just a few quarters ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Rick, I had a question about equipment reuse since this has been a theme as of late, and how you're seeing that play out in terms of how it affects process control maybe versus other equipment types?
Richard P. Wallace: By reuse, you mean extending technology nodes with equipment?
Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. It varies. I think it depends on product capability, process change and the availability of tools. I would say that by and large, we do not see a lot of reuse happening, and we actually have set up and offer to sell, even refurbish some of our older equipment. But in the leading edge, the reuse tends to happen in process areas that are not as sensitive, in fact, often not even key inspection or measurement points. So therefore, it doesn't really lend itself because our tools tend to be utilized pretty -- people are very careful about where they implement them, and they tend to implement them on the processes that have the least amount of margin, which is not where reuse happens. So even though years ago we set up a business to support it, it's actually not been extremely active us -- either for us or anyone else because on the leading edge, the things people are pushing are things that need metrology and inspection. So it hasn't impacted KLA-Tencor, and I think it may be another reason why process control will continue to increase as a percent of the overall spend, as people try to leverage the assets that they have.
Christopher Rand Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then my follow-up question was tied to your gross margin. It's come down a bit. You mentioned that some new products coming out, some inventory buildup affecting it. But has there been a meaningful shift in your equipment shipments lately that have affected that? And what would you need to kind of get those back to the high-50s range?
Mark P. Dentinger: No, there's been no meaningful shift in the equipment mix. This is Mark. Basically, what we're experiencing right now is that we're getting clipped a little bit on excess demand issues, largely in conjunction with building up the inventories to be more responsive to the customer circumstances and to manage the supply lines. And we do believe that, that is, at least -- let's call it a 1-, 2-quarter phenomenon and then it should resettle back into more normal levels. We also are responding the same issue a little bit on our service side as the distribution in the multiyear migration towards the foundries has reallocating balances into the service inventory levels as well. So those 2 phenomena, I think, are underway. It's just a question of how long that -- if you will, that transition is going to be with us. But in terms of just the raw margin, in terms of the -- on the product sales, that does not appear to be a factor.
Operator: And your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a follow-up question, Rick, on the 2013 industry CapEx you use. So have you accounted for the higher CapEx spend by this leading logic customer in your new view? Or is there still possible upside as you kind of sort things out with that customer? Then I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace: So, again, we're not -- I don't think we're the best people to forecast this because we're going largely on what's being said publicly. But in order for us to get to a flat or down 5 kind of range, we are accounting for what's been publicly stated. Now we also think that, that's going to change based on history. So yes, it accounts for increases on the 2 major players and the decrease in the other player.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just a follow-up on that same topic. Can you share maybe some of your updated thoughts on the timing of KLA's 450-millimeter R&D investment since that same logic customer says it is setting aside a significant amount of CapEx this year or next year for facilities?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. Yes, we've already shipped 450 tools, and we continue to do that. We're shipping primarily to equipment manufacturers. And so some of the first tools that went out for that were -- are bare wafer particle inspection tools. We're actually seeing some demand for other equipment or services that we offer for 450. We have wafers that we make smart wafers that are used in that, in our sensory division that we're seeing some demand for as well. So we are already supporting the equipment world for their preparation for 450. And we will have a rollout over time of the additional equipment as we phase in the next-generation. We're not retrofitting any existing tools. What we're doing is, when we introduce new models in the road map going forward, they have 450 capability in them, by and large, is how we're going to satisfy it. So we believe we're well-aligned to the latest industry thinking on timing. I'll also point out that in the past, the initial entry of 450 or any wafer size change was well in advance of any production. So the challenge, I think, the industry has is satisfying pilot needs, followed often several years later by the time you get to full production.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Rick, just wanted to understand how I should think about the 20-nanometer capital intensity for process control. Is it a 40% increase that some of the foundry customers have been talking about? Or is it more or less for you guys?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think it depends on how you quantify the overall investment. I wouldn't want to say that our business is going to go 40% up as a result of the same silicon capability, maybe the same die out but if you take into account shrinks. We are seeing additional points. I think what's important to understand is, the way our customers figure this out is they'll go through pilot, which they're doing, and they'll try to map out where they need, what kind of capability. And that's kind of an ongoing characterization process. And then they will -- as they're ramping, tune that, depending on what they discover in terms of how much process control they actually have over the process, both inspection and metrology, so we anticipate that the transition to 20 has similar characteristics to the transition from 45 or 40 down to 28 in terms of the challenges, the number of process steps, the number of critical layers and, therefore, we think in similar increase in intensity as we go forward. All that being said, I think in the end, that's how we derive the increased performance of process control in KLA-Tencor versus the rest of the capital budgets that people are -- the different sectors inside of WFE.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Appreciate that. And just one other question on the OpEx front. I mean, your OpEx is going to go up a little bit. How should we think about the trajectory for OpEx for the rest of the year?
Mark P. Dentinger: This is Mark. I think you're going to see OpEx basically in the range of 215 to 220 for the rest of the year. We won't be aggressively adding headcount at this point, but you do get some lumpiness as a result of material bias and whatnot in the R&D lab. So I think that's not a bad range to think about, but again, we'll update you quarterly if things change.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I had a -- just a clarification. When you said flat to down 5%, was that for the industry or was that for KLA in 2013?
Richard P. Wallace: That was for KLA as a measure against a 5% to 10% down for the industry.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. And then I was wondering if you have any updated view on e-Beam inspection and review on your competitor. And Taiwan has been very vocal about how optical inspection will reach limits or barriers at sort of the 10-nanometer node. So I was just wondering if you have any updated view on the e-Beam market.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think e-Beam is essential, I think that -- particularly for a review. I think that the ability to be able to see the defects that you're catching, you can catch defects without resolving them, but it's very hard to take corrective action without better insight into what the defects are, which is why the primary application for e-Beam is in review. Inspection offers some advanced capability but has their limitations. So we offer inspection as well and have for quite a number of years, trying to meet the needs in some niche places. The challenge for e-Beam inspection, much like the challenge, frankly, for e-Beam and lithography, is throughput and the ability to target the e-Beams to get them effectively, to get enough down onto a wafer and return so that you can image them and determine the defectivity leaves you at least 100x gap versus optical. And we don't see anything that's going to limit capability of optical inspection at 10-nanometer below. It will continue to get more challenging and expensive as it has. But inspection -- optical inspection tends to lag lithography by -- I think of it as 1 to 2 generations. So you can envision, if you're doing EUV-like lithography, you can optically inspect that with what is essentially 200-nanometer, sub 200-nanometer optical inspection, so you don't have to be at the wavelength. e-Beam has, as I said, some attributes that are highly valuable, but it has many challenges, not just throughput but also associated with the kind of nuisance effects that the e-Beams create and the charging. So we do have active programs. We believe there is a role for it. We've been investing in for a long time. I just don't see it replacing optical as the core technology for inspection.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, you're sounding a little bit more positive on memory, definitely, compared to the last call. And -- but your CapEx number has not gone up significantly. Could you give us a little bit more color on what your thoughts are on NAND and DRAM? Are they -- year-over-year, are they up? And what's the driving -- what's driving the spending?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I don't see them being year-over-year up. Actually, when we're modeling it, we have them flat to slightly down but second half-loaded, primarily associated with DRAM capacity that comes on, depending on what you anticipate for results. We actually have seen some positive momentum in our space. But overall, for CapEx, we're not modeling memory up, in fact, slightly down or flattish, if you will. And I think that the benefit from some of the recent integration of some of the M&A out there was we have customers that are out now making investments in advanced inspection capabilities in order to enable them to do technology migration. So that's where we're seeing a benefit.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And the follow-up is on reticle inspection. So we saw the bottom in the order in the last quarter and we see some pickup. But where are we in that particular cycle? And what will drive the acceleration to the last peak on the reticle inspection?
Richard P. Wallace: I think reticle is going to be lumpy going forward. I don't think there's -- that there is not a huge demand being created at the leading edge based upon the work that's going on in double patterning. And there is a lot of high-end capability that's been served already. So we have basically done a great job of penetrating the leading edge with our leading technology. So most of the activity tends to be more in the fab lines for recall, which is not a big -- as big a market and is something that, of course, we're focused on. But I don't think I'll provide the same size that we saw when we were launching and introducing the 6xx. Compensating for that is the increased opportunity in process control around multi-patterning. So the corresponding decline overall in the reticle is made up by increases and opportunities in overlay. So I think that on balance, it ends up actually looking pretty comparable but a shift of products based on the technology. When it will come back is when we see or if we see advanced EUV really take off, then there'll be a lot of opportunity in reticle again. But right now, that seems to be further in the future than it was just a few months ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Rick, two questions. First, how should we think about your products -- product mix as spending pattern changes given the foundry and logic spend much more compared to last year?
Richard P. Wallace: Not really very different from last year in terms of overall products mix for us. I mean, we are seeing that, basically, if you look at overall CapEx, you could have different models. But let's say you say down 5%, foundry is flattish to down 10%, logic is probably flattish. So the impact to us is that not a lot changes in the customer mix or the kind of process controls being utilized, except for the more advanced process control because we're a further along in the technology road map a year later.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just on a follow-up. How would you characterize at least on a qualitative basis the 20-nanometer ramp versus the prior 2 nodes in terms of achieving acceptable yields? I'm just trying to understand the duration of the yield ramp versus the prior 2 nodes.
Richard P. Wallace: I think our customers are focused on accelerating faster. They certainly get a lot of competitive pressure in the market. They recognized -- certainly, the fabless companies have recognized that first to market wins. So when I talk to our customers about it, they're expecting and planning to ramp faster than they did on 28. And I think most of the customers recognize the challenges that they faced in 28. So that's why I think we're seeing increased interest in process control on KLA-Tencor equipment to facilitate that. But every technology node, our customers say that they want to ramp faster, but this one is coming on the heels of what was pretty challenging for many ramp. So I think that there's increased heightened sensitivity to that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Rick, given the limited capacity buys on the memory side today, where's the focus been, I guess, on the technology buys in terms of memory? Are you seeing more orders in terms of 3D NAND flash? What's driving it, I guess, in the near term?
Richard P. Wallace: There's certainly development going on around 3D, as you know, and I think there's -- that creates opportunity for us. There's definitely interest, in general, in pushing patterning further, but I think the NAND guys are struggling a bit with that. So we're seeing overall increased focus on supporting technology migration, and that is certainly driven, I'd say, right now in NAND by the 3D work, although we don't expect to see production for that until probably late in this year. [Audio Gap]
Unknown Analyst: So, Rick, I have a question regarding your logic versus your foundry customer regarding what kind of option you get from these guys. So the foundry customer typically have a lot more different type of chips going for the lines. Do you see that as a result of that? Do you think that the foundry customer have a greater opportunity? And anyway you can kind of quantify it, for example, on a node-to-node basis or maybe the logic guy is the only one who know ahead. Is the opportunity similar? Is it 10% more or 20% more? Any way you can help us with that?
Richard P. Wallace: Pretty similar. I mean, I think that it depends. There are different logic manufacturers. Obviously, they are market leaders in that. But by and large, the question of high mix versus low mix is -- does have an impact, but often, it's offset by the people who have lower mix tend to be pushing technology perhaps a little bit harder. So that kind of counterbalances it. And I think in the end, there's probably more variation across different companies than there is across -- for example, foundry to logic is probably -- if you looked at all the data and didn't know if it was foundry or logic in terms of how people adopt and what their strategy is, you'd see actually more variation in the foundry space per se than you would just by going -- jumping between foundry and logic. Does that make sense?
Unknown Analyst: Okay. All right. I think I get what you were saying. A follow-up question also on the NAND side. I think yesterday, SanDisk talked about it, one, why node started to see increased capital intensity and, therefore, they have to spend more. Do you think you guys benefit from that, 1y versus 1x, or the kind of very leading edge on the NAND side?
Richard P. Wallace: I think that there is definitely challenges that create different opportunities for us. And so we often talk internally. If we can solve our critical customer problems that creates opportunity for us, return for them, so any time there's a shift in technology, it creates opportunities. And often, it obsoletes existing capability, although we'll try to reapply whatever we can. But certainly, as people go in the y-dimension, one of the biggest challenges they have is, especially when there are many, many process steps that are in a closed environment, it pushes things like qualifying the tools very hard, which interestingly plays to our bare wafer capability because you wouldn't necessarily think it. But it's a way to qualify tools so that making sure that they are not contaminating at all as they're going through these multiple steps. It also creates opportunities for people looking for defects with optical tools and then trying to figure out what they are with review tools. So it helps us in that regard. So we do see opportunities, and it does cause us to have to modify some of the technology, which means new tool sets in order to do that often, or pushing, as I said in the bare wafer case, pushing existing capability even harder.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: On the December orders that you came in above your guidance, and you had a pretty wide range of guidance, was that entirely due to foundry? And if so, was that more 28- or 20-nanometer-focused?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, given that foundry was 2/3 of our orders, then obviously, foundry was a big player in terms of how the bookings came out. We've widened the range of guidance often because there is a customer concentration. So you never quite know if deals are going to happen, when they're going to happen. But the foundry space, as we said, about 1/3 of our business in foundry is around the 20-nanometer work and the rest is 28. So I'd say that foundry was the larger influence. But there was stuff that came in at the end of the quarter, which we were not expecting, which is how we ended up above the range of guidance for bookings. And that was actually across the board. We saw some memory business come in that we didn't anticipate, we saw some logic come in and we saw some foundry. So it was generally strengthening at the end of the year, which I take to be a very good sign.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: And I have one follow-up. At SEMICON, you had a graph that showed a die-size impact for mobility products at the different node changes, pretty big increasing die size. Are your customers expecting the same thing between 28- and 20-nanometer for the same number of cores?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, there's certainly -- I mean, part of the reason to go to 20 is to not have the die size go up. So you have your choice of either increasing the functionality on the same size or actually reducing it. But the only point was that what's been fascinating about mobility is the notion that people would be -- have good enough performance and stop innovating, and we've definitely seen that, that's not the case. So as people go to 20, they're definitely going to push very hard on shrinking. The question is, will they then add multiple cores or will they expand to get more performance? And I think certainly, in some cases, that's going to be the case. And then you also have graphic dies, for example, that try to use these larger die as they can to provide the most functionality. So we're seeing both, but I'd say that it's a similar phenomenon to what we saw in microprocessors in the '90s, where die not only got more complex but got larger over time.
Operator: And our last question comes from Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just had a quick one on ASML and metrology. So they even talked about this on their last call, but they're beginning to use closed-loop metrology to help improve their litho process window, especially as the double patterning becomes more prevalent. And it sounds adjacent or maybe even complementary to stand-alone KLA tools, but I'm wondering if there's anything here we need to watch relative to metrology and how it's used for litho and if there are any emerging opportunities or risks for KLA.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that there are definitely reasons for people to try to increase the capability in overlay, and certainly, the idea of having more functionality closer to the process can make sense. What we're seeing right now is that the overlay market has expanded quite a bit. I do think customers are going to try to pursue alternatives to get their process under control, first and foremost, and then to manage their costs. So we always anticipate any change like that to be one that could potentially displace us unless we continue to add more value and create more capability for our customers. And so we take it seriously, we take any alternative approach seriously and it drives us to create more capability in our products and continue to innovate and continue to invest in them. So we're the leaders in overlay. We think we've got a great position to build upon. But we certainly look at the opportunity associated with the challenges of process control to also be a potential disruptor, and we've got to continue to make investments and support our customers to optimize our position.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Would there be an opportunity to actually integrate into a litho tool? Or is that something that's more or less off-limits?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, it wouldn't be a litho tool, it'd be a track. The integration doesn't really happen on litho because you have to have developed -- people have tried to do latent image measurement. It's just very hard to do and has been unsuccessful in the past. So the opportunity actually happens in the track. And yes, there is an opportunity to do that. But they're integrated and we've been looking at integrated for many, many years. And there are some advantages and then there are some challenges. The real question is, is the rate of change fast enough to warrant dedicating one tool per one track, which is what it would take? And there are customers that are experimenting with that, but there are those that have concluded that, that's not the best way to go. But we're certainly in close conversations with the people that are interested in that capability to provide that if that's the path they choose to go down.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. Let me turn the call back to our presenters.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Candice. I'd like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team for joining us here today. An audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later this afternoon. And once again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor. Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Adam, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Mr. Lockwood, you may begin.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Adam. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2012. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2012, and our subsequently filed 10-Q report. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking result -- in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2012 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Good afternoon, everyone. KLA-Tencor's Q1 revenue and EPS performance was generally in line with guidance, but bookings fell significantly below the guided range due to a challenging industry environment. Q1 revenue was $721 million, slightly below the midpoint of guidance, and non-GAAP net income per share was consistent with guidance at $0.84 per share. New orders in the September quarter were $506 million. The weakened macroeconomic environment has clearly impacted industry demand, and the leading device manufacturers have adopted a more cautious approach to their capacity expansion plans and scaled back investment in the near term. Customer concentration was also a factor in the Q1 bookings performance for KLA-Tencor, as orders from the Taiwan region were only 7% of the total in the quarter. We believe this was largely a function of order timing as certain customers delayed new orders as they absorbed previous purchases. Our December quarter forecast shows bookings for the Taiwan region returning to more typical levels. In spite of these adverse conditions, KLA-Tencor continues to execute our long-term strategic objectives, capitalizing on our market leadership and strong business model to deliver industry-leading financial performance and return significant cash to our stockholders. To that end, we generated $245 million in operating cash flow in Q1; paid our quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share, reflecting the increase we announced in July; and continued to execute our share repurchase program by repurchasing approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock, ending the quarter with a healthy $2.6 billion in cash and securities. Turning now to a discussion of the current demand environments. The end market mix for new orders in September was consistent with recent trends, with a concentration of orders among foundry and logic customers and investment focused on the leading edge. It seems clear from discussions with our foundry and logic customers that they intend to continue to invest at a high level and advance their leading-edge technology roadmaps. Foundry bookings were 54% of new orders in Q1, with a single customer accounting for a significant portions of the orders in the period. Logic bookings were 30% of Q1 orders and are expected to be strong again in the December quarter as the market leader moves forward with their 14-nanometer capacity RAM. Memory bookings were 16% of the total in Q1, with ongoing weakness in PC demand. And with uncertainty surrounding adoption rates of the anticipated new computing form factors, memory customers have adopted a wait-and-see approach for their near-term capacity investment plans. And consistent with that, our order forecast for memory customers is low in the December quarter. We maintain a conservative view of memory spend in 2013. In conclusion, not with that -- notwithstanding the cautious tone overhanging the industry today, we believe that the dynamics driving long-term industry growth are strong and our customers remain committed to their advanced technology roadmaps to drive innovation and device performance and meet profitability targets. Given our market leadership and strong balance sheet and business model, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading profit and stockholder returns as we execute our long-term strategic objectives. Now, guidance for the December quarter. December bookings are expected to be in the range of $550 million to $750 million. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $600 million and $660 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.45 per share to $0.65 per share. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with the [Audio Gap] And credits, any cost and credits which are outside of our core operations including unusual tax items. There was a $0.04 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, including a $0.01 per share after-tax difference for restructuring charges associated with our decision to exit the solar inspection business this quarter. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I mention GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. Q1 new orders were $506 million, down sharply from $827 million in Q4, and Q1 net orders were $510 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 43% in new systems orders in Q1, up from 26% in June quarter; Europe was 13% of new systems orders, up from 3% in Q4; Japan was 13%, up from 6% last quarter; Korea was 20%, up from 8% last quarter; Taiwan was 7%, down from 55% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 4%, up from 2% in Q4. The distribution of new orders by product group and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 51%, compared with 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 1%, down from 9% last quarter; metrology was 15%, down from 22% in the prior quarter; our non-semi businesses were 4%, up from 3% last quarter; and service was 29% of new orders in Q1, up from 18% last quarter. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by segment and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 54% of new systems orders in Q1 were foundry customers, compared with 65% in Q4; logic customers were 30% of new semi orders in Q1 versus 20% in Q4; and memory orders were 16% in Q1, up from 15% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q2 fiscal -- our fiscal Q2 will be within the range of $550 million to $750 million. In Q1, we shipped $686 million versus $866 million last quarter. The shipment numbers included both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $620 million and $680 million in Q2. Total backlog at the end of Q1 decreased by $208 million from June 30, and we ended the quarter with a little over $1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at September 30 included $252 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $772 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q1 was $721 million, down 19% from $892 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q1 was down $172 million to about $574 million, and services revenue was $147 million, roughly even with Q4. Our expectation for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $600 million and $660 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.6% this quarter, down from 60% last quarter. Most of the quarter-over-quarter decline in gross margin percentage was the function of lower systems revenue and lower factory utilization. For Q2, we are expecting gross margins between 55.5% and 56.5%. Operating expenses were $211 million in Q1, slightly higher than $210 million in Q4. Research and development expenses were $119 million, up about $1 million from Q4. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $93 million, roughly flat with Q4. We expect operating expenses in Q2 to be up somewhere between $5 million and $9 million from Q1. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q1, down about $2 million from Q4. Majority of the change was due to a $1.5 million write-down of an investment on our venture portfolio during Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2. In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $44 million or 24% of pre-tax income versus a 19% rate in Q4 of last year. The Q1 rate increase was largely a function of a change in the estimated distribution of earnings between our U.S. and international locations. We are modeling a 24% rate for Q2 as well. Non-GAAP net income was $142 million or $0.84 per share in Q1. The revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.45 and $0.65 per share. The weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q1 was $169.8 million versus $170.2 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $68 million repurchasing about 1.4 million shares. And as of September 30, 2012, we have approximately 1.9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of about $169 million for Q2. We also paid $67 million in dividends in Q1. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in Q2. On our balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.6 billion, up about $100 million from June 30. Cash generated from operations was $245 million in Q1 compared with $273 million in Q4. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $537 million, down from $701 million at the end of June. DSOs were 68 days at September 30 versus 72 days at June 30. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories were up $39 million from Q4 and ended the quarter at $690 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues is 1.9 turns in Q1 versus 2.2 turns in Q4. Capital expenditures were $20 million in Q1, up from $16 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30, 2012, was 5,814, up from 5,710 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. In summary, our guidance for Q2 is: new orders between $550 million and $750 million; total revenue between $600 million and $660 million; and non-GAAP earnings between $0.45 and $0.65 per share. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And so, operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar from Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering if you could comment a bit about anything unusual happening with regards to customer concentration transfer bookings in the December quarter, particularly around the foundry/logic side? And as you answer that, perhaps you can give a sense of what the mix of bookings would be by segment in December?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. I think that the -- I guess, the nature of our business now has got -- especially the foundries, that the orders have gotten pretty lumpy, and we certainly saw that in the quarter we just finished. We do anticipate foundries -- as we said, we anticipate foundry to be roughly about 52% of bookings in the December quarter. When we look across the segments, I think wafer is going to be -- right now, we're modeling wafer at 43%, and we're at 51% in the quarter that just ended. Metrology, up a little at 21%. Reticle really was quite slow in September, and we see that coming back to 13%. Service dropping to 19%, with the increase in business, and the other segments that we're in, about 4%. So pretty much a return, a little bit back to normal in terms of overall. And from a geography standpoint, Taiwan, going from the 7% we were at in the September quarter. We went 55% in June, 7% in September, and we think that kind of splits the difference in December at about 36%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen from Citigroup.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Perhaps a follow-up in terms of some of the lumpiness that we're seeing in foundry. Can you help us understand on a more granular level what is it about the nature of the installations that's causing that lumpiness? Is it in response to a particular configuration? Is it in response to perceived supply tightness? Just help us understand a little bit more what's fundamentally underpinning this trend? What gives you confidence that it may improve into the December quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, Terence. No, I don't -- I'm not suggesting the lumpiness will improve. I think that we'll continue to have that. As in particular, when we're in negotiations with customers about longer-term agreements, I think that can influence some of the decision-making. But what is -- what we certainly see in December, we've had a lot of conversations about delivery times. And I think as the whole industry is pausing right now, there is trying -- an assessment of how much investment is needed at what points, and there's a fair amount of digestion of existing capacity coming in. So we'd still have a rather large range on the December bookings. We have seen this phenomenon. In fact, it feels remarkably like last year, where the September quarter was very light, we didn't have much visibility and December came back quite strong. This year, we're seeing the pressures associated with 20-nanometer. There has been improvement in yield on 28, but still not where people really want to be. And so we see that, and then we see it combined with desires to ramp on certain -- from our certain customers in the early 2013 time frame. So that's all part of what goes into the forecasting we have for December.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Barclays.
Unknown Analyst: [indiscernible] calling in for CJ. Just following up on the trajectory for foundry orders into the December and beyond. Clearly, there's a little bit of a pickup into December. Just curious, as you think about the trajectory for first half '13, do you expect that to be boosted by initial 20-, 22-nanometer investments? Or how are you thinking about the linearity there?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we definitely see pressure for 20-nanometer, 22 capability getting driven in the first half. And what we do see -- if you think about the overall year for 2013, we're modeling now flat to down 10% and obviously finishing 2012 with a better quarter in December than we saw going forward -- going through the September quarter. What will drive it in this quarter and the next couple of quarters is really the capacity associated with 22, but also in preparation for pilot line in the second half of next year for 20-nanometer. And I think there are -- people are still trying to figure out their customer flow right now for that, and that's part of what's driving some of the uncertainty we just saw in the September quarter.
Unknown Analyst: Got it. And then with regard the -- regarding the overall WFE outlook for 2013, you had some of your peers talking about more upbeat outlook for the memory spending, especially on the NAND side. What's your view based on your conversations with your customers?
Richard P. Wallace: I think memory is going to remain flat. I don't see a lot of drivers for memory. I think that as we look at it, there's certainly a lot of uncertainty around it, around the consumer demand. The people I've talked to recently are hopeful that some of the ultrabooks are going to drive the solid state drives, but there's been a rather disappointing start to some of the adoption for those technologies. I also think that some of the form factors you're seeing now come out in some of the mobility devices are not driving the level of content that some had anticipated for NAND, which means perhaps not the growth rate that people were anticipating. So when you have a slower bit rate growth than originally modeled, it's pretty hard to see how CapEx goes up significantly as we go out into '13. So when we look at overall WFE, we're looking flat to down 10%. I would say in the last 2 weeks, the bias is a little towards the bottom of that range. And I think that overall, memory, not really -- not a significant pickup next year. Some technology buys, but not a lot associated with capacity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to just ask a question on the logic side. You said that you were going to see some orders from 14-nanometer in the December quarter. I'm just curious to see what kind of real scalability does your logic customer have and whether you are going to see a first half -- a strong first half in the logic segment?
Richard P. Wallace: We anticipate logic to continue to remain pretty strong. I mean, obviously, we're -- there's a lot of discussion and a lot of interest in reuse by all our customer base, and we facilitate that where we can as it's part of the overall value proposition. But sometimes, there are new technologies. They get brought out, that change the equation, and that's all modeled in our forecasting for what we see going forward. So we do see some I'd say more steady investment on the logic side perhaps than what we've seen in the foundry. And pretty strong, and as we've said, relatively strong in the December quarter and in the first half of 2013 as best we can tell right now.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then just to follow up on the foundry spending outlook for next year. TSMC this morning was talking about a flattish outlook for CapEx next year, and then Samsung has been suggested at least were down 30-plus percent CapEx next year on the foundry side. So I'm just curious to see what you think foundry CapEx will be next year, in your flat to down 10% outlook for overall spending?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, that's a great point. And then that's why I said if you bias it, I would have biased the flat to down 10% a little more toward the down, as we come off of the announcements we've seen in the last few days, even today's. However, we do see a lot of interest in process control. I'd also say that history has shown that those forecasts can change. And they change on end market demand. We saw that last year, and then they get ramped up. So for the modeling purposes, I think I'd bias it in the flat to down 10%. But we have to actually -- we got ourselves in a little bit of some challenges last year by not anticipating the strong demand that we got, and so we're going to remain flexible in terms of responding to demand. And process control continues to be a favored investment for the foundry customers based on their advanced technology challenges and the number of layers and complexity that they're dealing with now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett from JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Lead times, how they're changing, obviously as your revenue levels come down, and how that's affecting your guidance for the quarter for revenue? Because it's quite a wide range right now. And maybe how that affects your thought process on what customers can do in the first quarter of next year.
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes, this is Mark. The revenue guide takes into account all sorts of factors in terms of our forecast. We have a reasonably good idea of the range of revenue. What is tough to call is inside the range. There are binary events in terms of when customers do final acceptance on products. And there are obviously product line to product line difference in terms of the magnitude of the system sizes. So we do our best to forecast that, and we monitor as we go through the quarter. A probably reasonable confidence inside the range, but inside the range, it gets very difficult to say is one point more likely than the other. I hope that answers your question.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess I was just trying to get more of how your lead times are changing and, say, a foundry customer comes with a big order, how fast can you execute to that customer? Meaning do they need to order this quarter to start next quarter or are we getting into some shorter lead times here for some of your more complicated equipment?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, it does depend on the equipment and the toolset. And I think that the answer is we've gotten -- I believe we've gotten better in terms of our ability to respond, but often still not at the speed of which our foundry customers would like to see response. So it's a balance that we're running there. I think in similar products, as you know, we have longer lead times for some of the key components. And those, we tend to maintain a longer backlog and often have a bit less flexibility associated with that. So we're trying to be responsive. I think often the foundries don't actually have a great idea of what they're going to need, and from that reason, they're looking for flexibility. Just met with a major customer last week who said, "We're not sure what our investment profile is going to look like, but it's addressing a group of equipment makers. But we'd like you to be ready and be responsive." And, of course, that -- there's a lot of challenges associated with doing that. But it does -- our lead times are still out there a bit, but we do have to try to be responsive. Because when they ramp, they want -- especially they want our support upfront because it's often used in debugging process and bringing it to market.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I was just hoping to come back to maybe some of the math around the capital reuse issue. And one of the struggles, the conversations we have with investors is that the biggest logic customer is pretty explicit about reusing now 80% to 90% of their tools from one node to the next, similar to what they did from 45 to 32. And the question I get most often from investors is, does this apply to KLA? Does this apply to ASML? And if it doesn't apply to them, how can Intel claim to be reusing 80% to 90% of the tools?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that there's 2 things, Jim. One is the tool type and the other is the actual tools themselves. But generally associated with new technology ramps for customers that reuse, unless they are converting an entire factory and not continuing to manufacture anything at the prior node, they're purchasing additional capability in terms of capacity to be able to support that. And you can see in our history the spend of the investment of logic is not that hard to figure out. It's been relatively steady and reasonably consistent with the overall CapEx. So I think there's 2 things, one is that, and then the other is do they really turn off the old ones? And we're not seeing -- in general, we don't see customers the retirement rate of older technologies being very high, any higher now than it's ever been. And that's why I think the capital intensity for the industry and for logic remains in a similar kind of range as it's been, depending on what node we're in and depending on the specific tool types.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So that's helpful. If I could just ask as a follow-up to that, I mean so what Intel did or what one of your big logic customers did when you went -- when they went from 45 to 32 was they took 45 offline and ramped up 32 in that footprint. So they did take -- they did kind of shutter -- temporarily shutter old capacity. They're reinstituting that policy now for the 14-nanometer transition. Is that baked into your forecast or is that your assumption? Or is your assumption that they're not going to be taking the 22 and 32 offline to ramp up 14?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, and so then you get to specific tool types. So I'll give you an example. In general, let's say you've got a new technology that's associated with the new technology node that requires new inspection. Obviously, that's new, there is nothing doing it before. And I think that's often the case. Or let's say you win some share in a new segment that you haven't been in. Then it's not a reuse, it's a transition to something new. There are cases where you try to extend existing capability and provide it maybe with upgrades to satisfy the new technology node. But I've seen very seldom where it's the same toolset. It could be a similar toolset or the same toolset with upgrades, in which case, we model that as part of the overall investment. But it's -- I've never seen it. Because if you think about how it works, especially in a company that has a strict discipline around introducing a tool on one node and then waiting an entire node until the next tool, usually the tools that they're talking about have been dated at that point, and there's an upgrade cycle associated with it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I had a 2-part question. One, Rick, the weakness that you're seeing in the foundry bookings. Is there any way [ph] passing through to say how much of it is related to the cyclical and seasonal aspect of spending versus the yield [ph] improvements? And the second part of the question was can you talk a little bit about your optical inspection tool? There are some concerns out there that once you get below sub-2x nanometers, you'll have an e-Beam inspection. Although the throughputs are low, they seem to be improving over time. So can you talk about the longevity and the viability of your optical inspection tool at the sub-2x nanometer nodes?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, 2 tough questions, but I'll take them both in that order. The first, I'd say part of it was seasonal for sure. I mean, we typically -- as you know, we see a downtick in the September quarter. I'd say another part was just general uncertainty and maybe shifting end customer demand causing some rebalancing and maybe a pause in the overall cycle. So I think that's what we're dealing with. And as we said, just like last year, we expect -- in fact, 8 out of the last 10 years, the September quarter had been down for us. And so that seems to be pretty much of a pattern. This one was actually not down as much as we were a year ago at this quarter, and we had our second-best quarter ever in December of last year. We're not forecasting that, but we do see a snapback. In terms of optical, again, optical inspection, it is not -- we're not required to resolve defects in order to detect them. What is critical for review is to be able to use e-Beam for review, which is why we've invested very heavily and now have a very strong position in e-Beam review. But we're confident of the ability of our optical inspection products, and this has been verified with customers to take us well below the 2x node, and we have plans in place to get us down pretty close at this point to 1x. So I'm not concerned about our viability of the inspection. But it does need to be coupled with a high capability review tool, which is e-Beam-based, which we have, and we believe we have the best review tool in the market right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller from CLSA.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Mark, just had a question on the OpEx. I think you said up $5 million to $9 million. Just wondering what's driving that? And also, can you help us think about OpEx as we look into calendar '13?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes. I'll take them in that order. And the $5 million to $9 million, a part of that is just headcount, which will -- we do anticipate going up slightly quarter-over-quarter. But the other part of it is engineering materials associated with the new generation products that are currently working their way through the lab. As you think about our OpEx going forward into 2013, I think in the -- at the business levels we're experiencing today, you can expect it to be fairly steady and maybe up slightly over that period of time. But we do adjust it and tweak it based upon changes in roadmaps and changes in customer demands as we move forward. And I don't think we're anticipating a radical shift at this moment, but you never know. We have our eyes on the market and are watching business conditions as well.
Mark J. Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay, great. And Rick, a follow-up. Can you just talk about maybe process control spending intensity at some of the newer nodes? 20-nanometer and maybe 16 after that versus 28-nanometer?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. We see increased opportunity for inspection measurement as we go to the -- on a relative basis, as we continue to shrink. And obviously, driven by -- in this case, advanced lithography, which drives the double patterning challenges. And also in metrology, we have 3D structures to -- for our customers to deal with, which require, in many cases, optical CD capability which we have. So those -- so it's good for metrology overall. I think inspection there become similar to past trends. People are looking for smaller defects and, therefore, running higher capability tools at higher sensitivities, which requires some of our new technology, which drives increased demand. So overall, as we blend it, we look out and we think what does next year look like, I think some of the challenges associated with 2012 repeat in 2013. And we're seeing, as we said, CapEx flat to down 10%, and we think the process control intensity ends up being somewhere in the 14% to 15% range of the WFE, which is where we've historically -- slightly up from where we've been, as we see this overall some of the new challenges coming into the market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, you would just mention that if based on last week's data, you would say CapEx more on the lower end of flat to down 10%. Can you give us a little bit color on -- that new data, is that from the memory side or the foundry side?
Richard P. Wallace: Both. Talked to -- have heard recently from both very large memory and very large logic customers directly and indirectly about what their plans are, and I think there's a fair amount of caution right now. So as we model it and we kind of go through the list of the big investors that that's -- we can roll it up anywhere from 5% to down 10%. But I'd reiterate that I think there's a -- in everybody's case, there's a lot of macro uncertainty and those plans can change up or down depending on other events that right now are obviously not knowable.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And just one clarification. When you mention logic, you mean you include foundry in the logic, I would think?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we have -- it's kind of blending now when you think about -- even companies that are foundry, a lot of what they do is logic and not strictly foundry work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions, Rick. First on the -- how should we think about your product mix for next year assuming the spend bias is similar to this year in terms of foundry logic between your various product segments, wafer inspection, metrology and reticle inspection? Can you give some color on that? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace: Right. I think that we don't generally give forecast over the next year, but I can tell you, for product mix, obviously we're modeling it. But I can tell you the blend of what we're seeing for December is not atypical, which is you'd see wafer that, in this case, in the 40s, 43%; metrology, around 21%; and reticle at 13%, Part of what's happened with reticle is that the opportunity in reticle, there is a bit of a hiatus for some of the reticle manufacturers in the mask shop because they've gotten our advance capabilities. So a lot of the reticle business is now in the fab line. And until EUV comes, which has been delayed, and we've seen that because our advanced reticle tools provide EUV capability. And right now, there's just not a lot of demand for that. I think reticle stays a little bit toward the lower end of the typical range of 10% to 15%. Metrology continues to be strong but as does wafer inspection, as we look out. And then service makes up the difference depending on where we are. We see a service business that's growing and obviously becomes a larger part of our mix as the overall business softens, as in the guide for our revenue for next quarter. But we expect over time that, that number is going to actually come down as we resume growth.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Talked about 14-nanometer in -- at one of your logic customers, I was just wondering can you give us some insight into where you've made some inroads there compared to the prior node?
Richard P. Wallace: I'm sorry, it was very hard to hear you at the last part of the question.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Yes, yes. No, I just wanted to find out, given that you had made a commentary about 14-nanometer, I was wondering whether you can give us some color in terms of where you have made some inroads compared to the prior node?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, it would -- then we're getting a little bit specific. And so I'd rather not do that. I would say we are generally -- from a market share perspective, we had good gains over the last year. We anticipate being able to hold our position in terms of market share and build on it, and where we particularly are strong is when we're getting into advanced nodes and people need the advanced capability. I think historically where KLA-Tencor has not won shares often when there's a good enough alternative in nodes that are not as demanding. We tend to do pretty well in the most demanding notes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Rick, just a follow-up question on the December gross margin guidance of 56%. Is this customer concentration causing the slightly lower gross margin near term? The last time KLA had revenues in this $600 million range, the gross margin was slightly higher. So just wondering if you think gross margin can recover back to normal level as business stabilizes.
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes. Actually -- this is Mark, the answer is, is that customer concentration is probably a factor in it. It's probably not a huge factor, but there's no doubt that in terms of size and magnitude and commitment and timing of orders, we take all of that into consideration in terms of how we price and plan. I do not think it's the last time that we will see margins getting back to where they were previously, simply because the new generation of tools comes out and the differentiation in our ability to hold margin in those segments is largely a function of the differentiation in the products. And to the extent we can remain differentiated, I think you'll see margin performance in the long run consistent with what you've seen in the past.
Richard P. Wallace: It is also important to remember that when we look back at historicals, $600 million of revenue today versus a couple of years ago or years before that, the service mix is actually larger now. And that, of course, is dilutive to the overall gross margin.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And just a quick follow-up question, Rick, on KLA's ability to outgrow WFE next year. Do you think process control share at WFE next year depends a lot on the pace of foundry 20-nanometer ramp?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think it definitely -- yes. I mean, obviously if 20-nanometer doesn't go forward next year, then our percent -- the percent intensity would slow down, and we're certainly modeling foundry to be pretty healthy again. Although, overall for the year, we're not modeling a lot of growth. And we think the process control intensity stays at the 14% to 15%, which is higher than it was a few years ago. So from that perspective, sure, if you backed off. But I wouldn't tie it explicitly to 20-nanometer. I think there's also, what's going on, still 28 hasn't been fully built out at all semiconductor manufacturers nor has some of the logic work on 22. So I think there's other opportunities other than strictly the -- what's going on at 20.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I'm looking at your booking trend quarterly and over the past 3 quarters, it has been coming at the low end. And then I look at what happened late last year, the significant -- it was a very strong December '11. And, therefore, it seems like the dynamics of the industry has changed given the fact that customers' concentration is having an impact on the quarterly trend, doesn't it make more sense to focus more on the backlog and not how bookings are changing on a quarterly basis? And I'm asking this because your revenue is up or actually flattish. And if I were just to look at your booking for the year, it's down 11. But again, you started the year with such a strong backlog, that this quarterly bookings are becoming ineffective in enabling us to model. So maybe you can share with us any thoughts you may have.
Richard P. Wallace: Mehdi, that's a great point. And I do recall you bringing this very point up last quarter, not the part about not giving the guide, but the fact that we were low on it. I agree that it is increasingly a challenging number. It's very challenging to forecast the bookings. And frankly, not particularly -- it doesn't do a lot to drive our business. But historically, it's been a number we have given, and so we're reluctant to take it away because I think it's part of the overall modeling of the business that one uses to try to figure it out. What we have done recently, and we didn't used to do this, is give a broader perspective of our outlook over a longer term. So we're talking about 2013, and it used to be we would say that, "Look, we're not going to talk about 2013 because it's too far out." We acknowledge that but precisely for the reason that you're responding. And in fact, the way we're running the business is not on a quarterly basis, but trying to manage overall backlog and manage the factory size accordingly to where we think the business is. And you're absolutely right, if we look at last year, we've missed on both sides between September and December and then we ended up on average being about where we should have been. So from that standpoint, it wasn't particularly helpful either. So certainly, something we consider and debate, but it is hard as you know to break tradition of giving that guidance.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Sure. So to that extent, and looking forward your backlog for September quarter, actually if I were to dial in the midpoint of the booking guidance, your backlog for December will be down 30% to 40% depending on what you do with the product revenue backlog. And we're talking about a flat or actually down 10% WFE next year. So then, would it be fair to assume that revenues will be down a lot?
Mark P. Dentinger: Mehdi, just to correct one thing is, is that the backlog at the end of December will be a function of what we book and ultimately what we revenue in that quarter. So if we were to go to the higher end of the bookings range and revenue even at the midpoint of what we guided today, the backlog will actually build.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: For the purpose of simplicity, I'm just using the midpoint of the guidance range for booking revenue and shipment, and I'm assuming $100 million of product revenue backlog.
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes, well, actually all the backlog is product revenue. We don't include services in the backlog. So, again, midpoint of the bookings guide in the $650-ish million range, and midpoint of the revenue guide, $630-ish million or so. They're fairly close. The backlog won't change much if that comes to pass.
Richard P. Wallace: But you're talking from a year ago, the compare?
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, on a year-over-year basis, backlog will be down.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. No, that's right. We came in the calendar '11 with a lot of backlog. And actually, in this market, there's kind of an optimal level which we're always seeking, which is the right amount of backlog. Because there is a risk to having too much, and also you don't want to run it too light. I think we're closer to where we want to be now than we were then. We felt overly -- we had a lot of challenges going through '11 to catch up, and we had to ramp pretty hard in a period where there was customer demand. So we're trying to find a better level. I would say we're closer to that now. I got asked earlier about our responsiveness, and I think there is, in our business, a need and we focused on being more responsive to changes in the end demand. Which means in the end, that the backlog you can run with is a bit lower than it's been in the past. So when we model out for what does 2013 look like, and I go back to my flat to down 10%, we believe that based on the bookings we're forecasting, the backlog that we have, we'll be able to continue our strategy and objective of outperforming the industry on a revenue basis, although the bookings are going to be lumpy along the way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar from Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Rick, I was wondering if you can give an update on 28-nanometer use? I think recently you'd commented that you thought the use were fairly low, starting [ph] to collect in the 20s to 60s sort of range. Recently, we've seen large foundry comment that gross margins are picking up fairly well at the 28-nanometer node. I was wondering if there is an update in terms of what new trends you see in general at 28? And if we have 28-nanometer capacity expansion sort of dominate, the foundry CapEx for the next 3 quarters through June of next year. If the use are higher, what type of inspection demand should we see relative to what we've seen so far in the 28-nanometer cycle?
Richard P. Wallace: Right. All good questions, Satya. I think, yes, it is true, the yields keep improving. And it's a good thing too, otherwise I think there'd be no investment going forward if people weren't seeing yields improve. The range that I've given in the last few months on yields from the 20% to 60% on 28, certainly there's improvement but there's a big range. And the range depends on device type, process flow and manufacturer. So is the high end getting higher? I'm sure that it is because it's been a couple of months since we had those discussions. However, I think there is still plenty of challenges. And the other thing a lot of customers have mentioned is once they get yield on a small volume, it is not all often trivial to maintain them as they ramp volume of that device. So I think that there's still opportunity for us to support the ramp as it goes up. And I also think what we're starting to see now is investment in -- we'll see in the first part of '13, oriented toward the 20-nanometer node as much as the wrapping up of the 28. So I would say our equipment is often tied a little bit more heavily toward the front end of a node and the node that's coming up. So I think those are all things that are true, but of course, there are multiple providers of these devices and not everybody's yield is the same.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on your OpEx increase, does this target any particular type of products or is it a general sort of OpEx increase? And specifically, have you made a decision on whether or not you're going to do the actinic inspection system for EUV, and is that included in this OpEx increase?
Richard P. Wallace: It is, it is included. We continue to invest in actinic EUV inspection for the reticle inspection tool. We also have investment going on in 450. And as we've discussed in the past, pretty much all of our platforms, all our major platforms are going through pretty significant technological transitions over the next few years. So there is an increase in investment in general just to make sure that we have the capability that our customers are going to need in the future. But actinic is in there, as is some of the 450 work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Clearly, there's a lack of memory capacity buys at this time. But what have you seen from your end in terms of technology buys as the memory guys go to next generation, I guess, techniques and process technologies at formats like vertical NAND? What are you seeing from your buys on those next generation techniques?
Richard P. Wallace: It depends. I guess I would say there are some -- one of the challenges I think people are realizing with vertical structures of any type that's certainly vertical NAND is some of the historic approaches towards inspection measurement aren't necessarily applicable given the unique challenges of those structures. So in some case, there's proving out of technologies, there's trying to figure out reuse of existing as well as development of new. So there's -- I think there's a lot of challenge in that. But as you also know, it's a very -- it's relatively early in that development cycle. So I wouldn't say it's going to provide a big support level for our business, but it is important for the future. So we're definitely seeing inspection and metrology opportunities associated with new structures in memory, but not of a significant size at this point in time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bao [ph] Pang from Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: I apologize if it's already been asked. But for fiscal 1Q, relative to the high end of your order guidance, what were the disappointments relative to the high end of the guidance?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we had ones relative to the low end of guidance. It may -- we definitely had -- what's that?
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: I want to gauge what putting in kind of in the fiscal 2Q, is it the same upside potential in terms of an application?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, look, customer concentration is no secret in our industry. So you're talking about a few customers that tend to play, especially for companies like KLA-Tencor, that tend to place very large orders. And that creates a bulkiness or a lumpiness associated with whether or not that happens. And so it didn't happen in the September quarter, and we're anticipating that we'll get where we need to be in the December quarter, and that's what's in the guide.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: And then in terms of the 1Q, was it just a plummet of one customer that takes it from what your actual result is versus the high end?
Richard P. Wallace: No, there's a combination. There's also -- there was some memory business that was anticipated. And I think the brakes got put on because of a lot of concerns about the overall memory market. There was also some outside of core semi. I mean it was a combination of factors. But I think in general, I'd characterize the September environment for equipment, that by and large people were in a wait-and-see mode to try to figure out where are we in the overall economic cycle. And a lot of what we heard from customers was a desire, in fact a wish that they could invest but that they were getting held up at their senior levels, as people were trying to reassess where the market is and what kind of investments are warranted going forward given a very uncertain macro environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Rick, just wanted to get your perspective on 28-nanometer ramp, where we are in some of your -- the competitors and customers have talked about getting 200,000, 300,000 wafer starts from [indiscernible] higher by the middle of next year. I'm curious to see what you think and how you see process control spending relative to that? And then just on 20-nanometer, one of your big foundry customer was talking about really a very small pilot production, a small production next year but with a major ramp from 2014. So I'm curious to see what kind of 20-nanometer spending you expect next year?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. 28-nanometer, we have the Giants in the World Series, so I can use a baseball analogy. I'd say we're in the fourth inning on the 28-nanometer ramp. In terms of the 20-nanometer, we're going to see investments associated with that in the first part of next year. Remember, we often get investment early in the cycle because people are trying to debug their process. So I think that's kind of where we are. There's already been some preliminary looks at that, but I think that we're going to see more as we go into calendar '13.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: That's helpful. I just wanted to follow up, one of your competitors has talked about refocusing on certain areas within their business, one being process control, I believe. And just wanted to understand from your standpoint where the competitive dynamics are. Any product ideas or segments you see more competition relative to the prior nodes?
Richard P. Wallace: Every one of our product line has had competitors for as long as I've been -- 24.5 years I've been with the company, I don't think that's going to change. I think there is a lot of interest. I don't anticipate anybody backing off in terms of trying to provide capability. I wouldn't say any particular segment is under any additional threat now than they've been in the past, which drives us to continue our investment and continue to focus on our customers. But I don't see the landscape changing. We've always had a lot of competitive pressure, and I expect that to continue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett from JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Two questions. First was you are taking away or getting rid of your solar inspection business, and yet you're still guiding your OpEx up. Just wanted to get a context, it sounds like this wasn't a very big cost center for the company, the solar side versus what you're adding onto the OpEx?
Richard P. Wallace: That's correct. And we're also -- it was a very small part of -- it's actually a part of an acquisition we did a few years ago, and we're redeploying most of the resources there on some additional opportunities in the back end. But, yes, but it wasn't a big part anyway.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then the follow-up was, Rick, you mentioned we're kind of in the fourth inning of the 28-nanometer ramp. I guess maybe a different way to ask this is, from an equipment that's already been shipped perspective, what kind of inning do you think we are in 28-nanometer, given some of that...
Richard P. Wallace: The way it's going now, like the bottom of the fourth.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. So just wasn't sure because often it takes a while to bring that equipment online and ramp it up, so...
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, it's gotten -- it's, I was -- I'm scared of those analogies. It's gotten a little quicker. I'd say the people have gotten pretty good at bringing in and ramping up. And especially the foundry world, I think all of us, all the equipment guys have learned to move very quickly to be able to support the velocity associated with those businesses.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Ed.
Ed Lockwood: All right. Thank you, Adam, and I'd like to thank everyone on behalf of the management team today for joining us here. An audio replay of today's call will be available on our website later on this afternoon. And once again, we appreciate your interest in KLA-Tencor.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Amanda and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood of KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Amanda. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to KLA-Tencor's fourth quarter fiscal year 2012 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2012. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011, and our subsequently filed 10-Q report. In these filings, you'll also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2011 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, you can be assured any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you, all, for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the Q4 and fiscal year '12 financials. Let's begin with a quick review of Q4. Gross bookings for the June quarter were $827 million, slightly down from March. Foundry was 65% of semiconductor system orders in Q4, continuing the strong foundry demand trend over the past several quarters. Logic was steady at 20% and memory was 15% of new orders. June quarter revenue grew 6% to a revenue record $892 million, coming in at the upper end of the range of guidance. And non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.49 in Q4. Our EPS was above the range of guidance, partially due to a 19% tax rate for the quarter. If our tax rate had been 26% as expected, our EPS would have been $1.36 at the high end of the range of guidance. Mark will provide more detail on this tax commentary. Finally, cash flow from operations was $273 million in Q4. We were active in returning value to stockholders, repurchasing 1.35 million shares in the quarter for $67 million and of course, paying our regular quarterly dividend. Also, as we announced on July 10, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. This is the fourth increase in the quarterly dividend level since it was first instituted in 2005 and reflects our confidence in the long-term outlook for the company. KLA-Tencor's strong performance in Q4 and for fiscal year 2012 showcases the company's market technology and business model leadership in an industry CapEx environment, driven by mobility market growth and featuring high levels of investment and leading-edge foundry and logic. Against this industry backdrop, KLA-Tencor is successfully executing our long-term strategic objectives and delivering industry-leading performance in terms of growth, profitability and stockholder returns. Of course, the major factor in our success continues to be strong collaboration with customers and business partners and the great execution of our worldwide workforce. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank each of our employees for their contributions in helping KLA-Tencor excel in this environment and in shaping our future success. Now for some additional perspective on the near-term demand picture. As we noted at SEMICON West, the industry demand outlook for the rest of calendar year 2012 has backed off recently due to a combination of weaker memory forecast and some softening in near-term foundry demand. As a result, industry observers are now expecting full-year industry CapEx to be down in the range of 10% to 15% in 2012. However, looking past this current pause, we believe the factors which are helping sustain the high levels of CapEx investment seen in this cycle remain in play. With mobility markets fueling growth for the market leaders in memory, foundry and logic, and in an increasingly more complex leading-edge technology and manufacturing environment. In foundry, even with the expected near-term softening in demand, leading-edge capacity remains in tight supply. And the yield challenges associated with advanced technology ramps are well documented. Meanwhile, the rapid pace of innovation in next generation semiconductor devices to support mobility market growth continues unabated. Looking ahead, even with a modest, as expected here in the second half of calendar 2012, foundry demand is expected to remain at high levels as customers continue their 28-nanometer ramp and begin 20-nanometer development in 2013. Logic investment today is focused on ramping 22-nanometer manufacturing processes and volume and development of next-generation technologies at the sub-20-nanometer node. Logic demand is widely expected to accelerate in 2013 as the 20-nanometer technologies begin to ramp in volume. Logic demand in this cycle is fueled by the competitive dynamic surrounding the future intersection of X86 and ARM-based processors for mobility. Although memory CapEx forecasts for the second half of calendar 2012 have weakened lately, we believe that memory market leaders remain committed to their advanced technology roadmap with upside to current forecasts hinging on successful ramp of new Ultrabook PC and smartphone products. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. We expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of $625 million to $775 million. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $700 million to $760 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.95 in the quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll note that we present our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges and credits and any cost of credits which are outside of our core operations including unusual tax items. There was a $0.03 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I mention GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. Q4 new orders were $827 million, down slightly from $833 million in Q3. Net orders were $787 million, down about 4% from last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 26% of new systems orders in Q4, up from about 22% in the March quarter; Europe was 3% of new systems orders, down from 8% in Q3; Japan was 6%, down from 11% last quarter; Korea was 8%, down from 39% last quarter; Taiwan was 55%, up from 13% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 2%, down from 7% in Q3. The distribution in new orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 48% compared with 54% last quarter; reticle inspection was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; metrology was 22%, up from 19% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 3%, down from 4% last quarter; and service was 18% of new orders in Q4, up from 17% last quarter. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 65% of new orders -- new systems orders in Q4 were from foundry customers compared with 55% in Q3; logic customers were 20% of new semi-orders in Q4 versus 16% in Q3; and memory orders were 15% in Q4, down from 29% last quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our Q1 fiscal 2013 would be within a range of $625 million to $775 million. In Q4, we shipped $866 million versus $818 million last quarter. The shipment numbers include both system shipments and service as [ph] revenue. And we expect shipments between $700 million and $760 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased by $106 million from March 31, and we ended the quarter with about $1.2 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at June 30, 2012, included $286 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $947 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q4 was $892 million, up 6% from $841 million last quarter, and virtually even with last year's Q4 record total revenue. Systems revenue in Q4 was up about $44 million to about $746 million. And services revenue was $147 million, up about $7 million from Q3. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $700 million and $760 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% this quarter, up from 58.3% last quarter. Most of the Q3 to Q4 gross margin percentage improvement was a function of higher volume and favorable product mix. For Q1, we are expecting gross margins between 56.5% and 57.5%. Operating expenses were $210 million in Q4, compared with $199 million in Q3. Research and development expenses were $118 million in Q4, up $9 million from Q3. The quarterly increase in R&D was mostly related to higher expenses for additional product material. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $92 million in Q4, up $3 million from Q3. We expect operating expenses in Q1 to be up slightly from Q4. OIE was a net $12 million expense in Q4, up about $2 million from Q3, majority of the changes due to $1.5 million write-down of an investment in our venture portfolio during Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q1. In Q4, non-GAAP income tax expense was $59 million or 19% of pre-tax income versus a 23% rate in Q3. In Q4, rate decrease was largely a function of the change in distribution in earnings between the U.S. and international locations. In setting tax rate guidance for our fiscal 2013, I'll provide our view of next year's rate, as well as our expectations for the rate over the next 3 years. Our best estimate of the fiscal 2013 rate is 24%, which is a 2-point drop from last year's planning rate. Our estimates for the rate over the next 3 years is the range between 22% and 26%. Obviously, many factors enter into these rate estimates, including the geographic distribution of earnings and in all likelihood, the actual rate in any given period will be different than our estimate. Non-GAAP net income was $253 million or $1.49 per share in Q4, up from $1.27 per share last quarter. If we apply our 2012 model tax rate of 26%, Q4 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.36 per share. With the revenue range I previously mentioned and using a tax rate of 24%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.75 and $0.95 per share. The weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q4 was $170.2 million versus $170.1 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $67 million repurchasing about 1.35 million shares. And as of June 30, 2012, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We also paid $58 million in dividends in Q4. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share in Q1. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 170 million for Q1. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.5 billion, up about $165 million from March 31. Cash generated from operations was $273 million in Q4 compared with $262 million in Q3. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $701 million, up from $638 million at the end of March. DSOs were 72 days at June 30 versus 69 days at March 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories were flat with Q3 and ended the quarter at $651 million. The inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q4, the same as Q3. Capital expenditures were $16 million in Q4, up $2 million from Q3. Total headcount at June 30, 2012, was 5,710, up from 5,655 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q1. In summary, our guidance for Q1 end: new orders between $625 million and $775 million, total revenue between $700 million and $760 million and non-GAAP earnings between $0.75 and $0.95 per share, assuming a tax rate of 24%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Richard P. Wallace: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A and we do once again request that you limit yourself to one question given the limited time we have for today's call. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up your questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow-ups in today's call as time permits. So Amanda, we're ready for your first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering if you could give a sense of what the order mix by segment would look like in the September quarter? And at this time, if you have any thoughts on how the orders would shape up for December with a view on trying to get a sense is there a smooth track up close into [ph] the sort of revenue this year?
Richard P. Wallace: Satya, yes, it's Rick. Memory forecast is not that different, percentage-wise. We think probably about 17% of orders is what we're currently looking at. Logic, down a little, 15% off of the 20% for the quarter we just finished. And it looks like foundry would be about 68%. So that's how we're currently modeling it, not a big change. As far as the rest of the year, and it's very hard, we don't guide out for the December quarter, but we do see the overall picture softening, as we said in our guide, for the September quarter and then we'd expect some resumed investment coming back in the December quarter as we talked at SEMICON West.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This question is a little bit of a qualitative commentary on how you see your customer's behavior changing. It certainly feels a lot like last year in terms of the 3Q order pause. And if I think about last year, that order pause in some ways got us into the 20-nanometer shortage that we experienced in the first half of this year. I wanted to understand, do you observe your customers responding any differently to macro uncertainty this year around versus last year around, especially considering some of the foundry shortages that we experienced so far this year?
Mark P. Dentinger: Terence, it does have that feeling. It does look pretty similar. I think it is perhaps for different causes, but a similar sense of headwinds that are causing, I think, the pause that we're seeing from our customer base. Whether that will result in any shortages, it's very hard to tell. I can say that as our customers work on 28, they haven't made progress. They haven't made it as fast as they'd hoped, and there are plenty more challenges. And the early look at 20, makes it look even more challenging than what they experienced in 28. So I don't know if it will create shortages or not, but I do see some conservative behavior on our customer base in the short term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I guess I was hoping, I guess first off, to get what your ending backlog and deferred revenues were for June? And what I'm getting at is that it seems like your revenues are a little bit light for September, so curious if you're building backlog or what's going on there?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, the ending backlog, C.J., was $1.2 billion, about $300 million in revenue backlog and about $900-million-plus in shipped backlog. And if I could just scroll forward to see what the deferred revenue was, the ending position in deferred revenue, well there's about $150 million deferred systems profit, which is a netted down number. You can probably gross that up against our average gross margins and figure that there's at least $450 million to $500 million in, if you will, true deferred revenue related to systems business. That's a rough approximation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth from Cowen.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, I'm curious, will the followers in the foundry space likely have the same inspection intensity as we saw at TSM, the leader, or do they in some way benefit by following and maybe learn an industry sense from the leader and is the trailblazer in any way disadvantaged?
Richard P. Wallace: Raj, that's a good question. I wouldn't -- history would not necessarily play that out. I do think it's a function of experience on advanced nodes. I think it's a function of the exact process people are running and the experience they've had with prior nodes but we have seen more variation, I would say, across different companies in terms of intensity than you might expect given the notion that the first guy might trail-blaze it. It just hasn't worked that way. And in some cases, you get followers later in the cycle that invest more heavily, and there are dependencies on process, which do change. And philosophy, frankly, there are some customers that might orient themselves more toward a certain kind of inspection tool based on the philosophy that they have. And the result varies as we go across the board. And even from customers from cycle to cycle, it can vary, too, the same players.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish. I just wanted to get a bit more granularity into your outlook. ASML recently said that foundry spending should moderate near-term, which is in line with what you guided, but they also said they expect 20-nanometer production to start ramping at foundry starting in mid-2013. Can we get your sentiment on the timing around that and just what confidence do you have in the improvement in the order trajectory after September?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that it's always hard to predict as we look out, because as you know, we're subject to many factors, not the least of which is uncertainty in the macro environment, which does influence our customer's behaviors. But relative to the technology, I think a lot of confidence that the investment that we saw in 28 will be followed with increased investment on 20 and we get that from 2 ways: one, when we look at the process itself and identify the exact number of inspection points and the tools that will be needed and the throughputs associated with those and how we model the factory, we do a pretty good job of modeling that. But we also have some experience now on 20 and even sub-20 of what people are seeing in their comfort level with the information that they have and how they're pushing us for later generation tools. So exact timing is always hard to predict in this industry as you know, but we're certainly seeing early indications on 20 that we think there'll be a lot of pressure on the inspection and measurement space in terms of opportunity and installation at increased number of layers with increasing complex -- complexity in their process and in our tools. I can't speak to the exact timing, but even in historically slow periods, our customers tend to move forward on technology.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: First, a clarification. I'm just wondering if you still expect, I think at SEMICON West you'd indicated orders for the calendar year to be down only slightly, and so I'm just wondering if that's still the case? And I'm also wondering if you could comment on sort of customer behavior since SEMICON West. Has it gotten sort of softer or is it sort of fairly consistent?
Richard P. Wallace: Right. We updated our guide for the year for CapEx, was I think many people had going in to West or prior to that, the last update was flattish. And I think along with others, what you'd now see us modeling the year to be down 10% to 15%. We, however, will outperform that as we model our revenue going forward, which is really the right metric against industry CapEx. And so we anticipate, given our view of the quarter we just guided and in general, the overall expectations for the year that, that will continue. As to whether it's gotten worse since SEMICON West, I don't think so. I think it's in line with what we saw. There were many -- and what came up with this down 10% to 15% were -- have been, I guess, further confirmation of that. But on the other hand, there has been increased conversation about '13, which has been more positive. So I feel reasonably confident that what we're seeing is a softening or a pause and we'll see resumed growth. I think the caveat in all this, the obvious caveat is the macro, which nobody really has a good way to predict at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Rick, I had a question related to your -- within the product mix outperformance, underperformance. Where do you see that with this 28-nanometer foundry node and what different types of equipment are really being adopted at a faster rate or I guess more aggressively to enable that?
Richard P. Wallace: I think if you look at some of the material we talked about in SEMICON West, we gave an example of our leading edge brightfield tool, the 29xx, which we were seeing ramping up in the first 4 quarters, approximately 3x the revenue of the prior 4 quarters compare for the prior generation. And you know, really that was an example in the inspection space. We have seen similar -- a better way [ph] for a similar push on new technology. I think that the other end of the spectrum is on metrology and a good example there would be what happened with our overlay tool, the one the optical metrology Archer tool, and that has really had strong demand for that and we have a very strong position in that product line. That's driven heavily by multi-patterning. I think an area where you've seen less performance in general would be in an area like reticle inspection, and that has been driven largely by the fact that there's a lot of capability when we introduced our latest generation. We really have served that market well with that product. But due to the -- its capability and capacity, we have not seen subsequent demand increasing in line with what we've seen for the tools that are directly in the fab line. The other area I would say has been slower, has been associated with directly with wafer manufacturing, where wafer guys went through a heavy investment phase and are -- still have still not worked off all the capacity that they had. So in that area, we are more like people that are selling directly into -- associated with the process equipment in terms of ramping with capacity. So our strength has really been in the product lines that are more tied to the complexity of manufacturing process directly and less with things like reticle and bare wafer.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Rick, I wanted to just understand, in your foundry segment revenues or bookings, what percentage of those bookings or revenues would be associated with either 28-nanometer or capacity buyer then what percentage would be 20-nanometer technology buyer?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, that's a good question. I'd say that at this point, probably 75% are associated with 28, maybe 80% 28 and some is on the -- the rest would be on the development associated with 20. But there is somewhat of a blurring in that because there -- it is true that they might buy them for 20-nanometer development, but be utilizing them in 28. But I'd say right now, we're probably somewhere along that split.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Rick, you talked about outperformance. How much was related to the spending mix for this year and how much was really share gain?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that the mix certainly, being in foundry and having a strong footprint of foundry has been a good place to be, and I believe will be a good place to be as we go forward. Also, we're strong in logic, the place where we had struggled would be in the place that's not been investing heavily and where we have not performed as well. Although we have very strong indications, technology buys and memory are -- will come our way when they happen. I do think there's been some share gain in some product lines in particular like in medium review [ph] where we've brought on really a strong product line and I think clearly have the best product in the market today. We're definitely seeing benefit from that. So I think it's a combination. But I would say, 70% associated with the fact that our core business in foundry continues to expand through adoption and then maybe 30% of our gains have been associated with market share.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: In terms of the reticle inspection, I think you commented on an answer to an earlier question, the capability is already sufficient for the 20-nanometer. Does the additional overlay steps, does that drive any additional capacity requirements for reticle inspection?
Richard P. Wallace: Not as much. And partly is, a lot of those design rules are not -- they're not as advanced. And so part of what you get away with multi-patterning is, you don't push as much on the very leading edge. So we do have capacity with 6xx. And part of the capabilities of 6xx has been EUV-related and there are some customers that purchased for that, and that development has been slower than our customers anticipated. So there's just been less in terms of EUV. But, no, the -- most of the benefit of multi- patterning goes towards our overlay business as opposed to toward our reticle business.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, I just want to follow-up on that, on the EUV. I know the industry is focused entirely on the power, but I suppose there are lots of challenges with the mask of blank operation and you have the advantage of looking at the masks through your inspection -- relevant inspection tools. Do you have a sense of where the industry is in terms of mask, defect rate for mask? And could that be an issue in adoption of EUV?
Richard P. Wallace: I think that there's no question that right now, most of the energy is focused, as you said, on power and throughput and getting the run rate of the EUV scanners up. There is progress that's been made, but of course a lot more progress has to go. I have been saying for some period of time that I think then we will get into the next challenge, which is contamination-related in the entire sense, not just what happens in the reticle but the entire system. And there's going to be a lot of work to do there But frankly, right now, it's kind of hard. You have to do one before the other. And I think that there is going to be a learning curve associated with it, which is why I do think that the production volume of EUV will be delayed as a result of some of those challenges, the technical challenges. But I -- there's nothing, showstopper-wise, that I have heard of anyone seeing on the contamination work, which is a lot of work, and I don't want to minimize it by saying it's just engineering, but there's a lot of work that has to go into it because I think the more fundamental challenge is going to be associated with power. We do expect the reticle opportunity to be significant, but at this point delayed because of the challenges with ramping EUV.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Rick, I'm looking at the -- your booking guidance for the past couple of quarters. And for the March and June quarter, you have been coming at the low end. I'm just wondering, is that because your foundry customers have consolidated and there is only, maybe one or very few that have been able to ramp 28? Or is there something else that is impacting your forecasting? And I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I wouldn't want to drive a trend line through 2 points. I'd take it back to December last year where we missed wildly on the other side. We were up 85% and we guided way under that. I think it speaks a little bit more to the challenge associated when you have, maybe to your point, you have a smaller number of customers. And I think in many cases, they don't even know and so they make decisions very late in the process as they are moving things around to try to figure out where they have needs and what the time frame is for those needs. So I wouldn't draw any conclusions where we back up from and look at how are we doing relative to the overall industry and we're pretty happy with our performance. I would say it is true. If you want to find an area of criticism, our forecasting accuracy is not very good, but we also don't think it's an area that is of particular value in terms of long-term success with the company. So we don't tend to run it on our ability to accurately forecast. We're still building backlog and we're still supporting the needs of our next-generation products and customers.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: That's fair. And then I think I may have missed it, what did you comment or what did you say about booking trend into the December quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we anticipate a strengthening out of September for a couple of reasons. One, this is an area we do have some history on. As 8 out of 10 years, we do tend to see a softening in the September quarter followed by strength in December. And then as we talk with our customers, there seems to be a narrative around the overall industry dynamic that would support that, that we would see increase. And if you go back to last year, that was when we had -- we finished the second half of the year basically where we thought, but certainly not how we thought in terms of September, is very soft followed by an outstanding quarter in December. So it's those trends, and then we just -- you do bottoms up and you see all the projects that are on the books and what people are talking about. And that's kind of how it works out for us.
Operator: We have one further question from Satya Kumar, Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wondering if there was any pre-bookings, cancellations or backlog adjustments in the June quarter? And in following up to C.J.'s question earlier on, when I go back and look at quarters where your orders have declined, in some occasions, the backlog goes down and the revenue guidance is a bit higher and in some occasions it's not. And I guess the surprise here is that the September revenue guidance is a bit below where people thought. Could you provide a little bit more clarity as to how to think about that?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes. Satya, I can take the question on the revenue guidance for September. You actually have to go deal by deal, and I would emphasize that, what the business emphasis inside the company is getting orders in, getting the orders shipped, getting installations done and making sure that the customer's set with the tool. And once we get all of those things done, the revenue recognition process moves to a different side of the house, including the finance side of the house, and goes through customer acceptance, sign-offs and another set of processes, which doesn't always follow necessarily linearly the booking and the shipment rhythm of the company. It's close, so if you look at it over a long period of time, sooner or later, the revenue passes through the system. But it is, I would emphasize, it is a different process and you can't necessarily draw those correlations, at least very, very tightly quarter-to-quarter. So we go through and basically do a bottoms up forecast. We know what we've taken in for orders over the last 2 to 3 quarters. We know what is shipped over the last 1 to 2 quarters, and we take all of that information and go on a case-by-case basis, what do we expect to turn to revenue, but the exact timing of when it turns to revenue is a function of when the customer does his final sign-off and so on and so forth. So I wouldn't read too much into it. But the revenue range that we did give, it's a penciled-out detail analysis of exactly what we think will turn in September. And by the way, as you know, because some of the average selling prices of our tools are pretty big, a few going either way can change the outcome.
Richard P. Wallace: Satya, just to add a little color for you. Mark did allude to and said that we did have some de-bookings, if you will. And your question on that, I'll tell you what -- how that works, is one of the -- it's related to EUV because some of the capability we have for EUV, as I've mentioned before on blank, is in our Teron tools. And when a tool delivery gets pushed out beyond the 12-month horizon even though there's customer interest in demand and a desire to get it, we then take it out of the system. And that's what we saw and that's a fairly sizable -- we're very confident the customer wants it, but frankly, based on their initial modeling and demand for EUV and what they're seeing now, they don't feel compelled to get additional capacity. They already have some capacity. But the EUV ramp is going slower than they anticipated, so as a result, we make an adjustment, and that's part of what the change in backlog by the gross bookings and the net bookings were different. So that there's this specific example on a delay we're seeing in our customers on EUV.
Mark P. Dentinger: And you can do the backwards math, that for the selling price of the tool, that's about most of the adjustment in the backlog.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And that's one tool, right?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes.
Operator: And presenters, we have a few follow-up questions. The first is from the line of Patrick Ho, Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Rick, in terms of the outlook for September in orders and your projected uptick in December, could you just give a little color in terms of, do you see the decline in September being kind of offset by the same uptick in the December quarter? Or is it a magnitude, just kind of depend on when the customers come back?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, Patrick, as we said, we have enough trouble guiding 1 quarter, let alone 2. But that being said, I don't think that's an unfair way to characterize it. But I might've said that a year ago and been very wrong on December. It very much goes to our customers' behavior around our equipment tends to be more volatile than it might be about process equipment because of their perceived need.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. Just looking at big picture and just some of the industry trends that we've talked a lot about EUV 450 out there, advanced wafer level of packaging. What are some of the opportunities you see for process control in that emerging market place?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, a great question. We have a business there where we're seeing good performance out of that. That's in the business we acquired a few years ago, ICOS, where we do participate in that business and we have seen some strength recently, and I think there is some good opportunity for that for us going forward. There are some other opportunities, technology-wise, that are under investigation where there are technical challenge, but it's not as evident as if they provide a really sustained business opportunities for us such in things like TSV for inspection and measurement. But definitely, in general around packaging, we have good performance there.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Curious on the foundry side, and I know it's going to be hard to predict, but I was hoping to get your sense of where are we in 28 for you guys, and maybe you want to talk baseball speak, what inning?. And then, how you see 20 adoption in 2013? And I guess as part of that, what the linearity could look like. Would it be similar to what we've seen with the last 2 years, front-half loaded or I guess, what are your conversations today suggesting?
Richard P. Wallace: So I'm going to turn to football, C.J. because -- I'll tell you the conversations. We try to break it down like that, but I'll give you another way we're talking to our customers about it. We don't have that many big customers at this point and the conversation we have often is around 2013 and a lot of them recently, because of their frustration with not getting deliveries from us, have been talking very clearly about what they believe their needs are going to be in 2013 relative to 2012. And when we go through all that conversation, we feel pretty good about how 2013 looks. And for them, it's driven by whether it's by 28 final buildout or a 20 ramp. It's not as obvious exactly what the deployment is, but they are being very clear about what they think in terms of the kind of tools, the number of tools and the timing of those tools. And so, I would say that if they then were to map it on to 28 versus 20, that's something they're doing. The conversations they're having with us are actually -- are at a higher level, and it goes something like, "We really need you to continue to support us as you have this year and we just want to give you a heads-up. We believe next year will be strong or stronger in many cases, when we look at it and we think the timing over the next year will give you more clarity when we get it." But those are more of the conversations we have with them. It gets less about the specific timing and the phase of their node. Does that make sense?
Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. No, actually that's very helpful.
Operator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters for any closing remarks.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, thank you, Amanda. And we'd like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in KLA-Tencor.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Steve, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Third Quarter Fiscal '12 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call today. Joining me today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer.  We're here today to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2012. We released these results this afternoon 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.klatencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy.  A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investor section of our website. There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2011, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports.  In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true.  Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2011 Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, you can be assured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. I'm pleased report that KLA-Tencor began calendar 2012 with a strong fiscal third-quarter, delivering revenue and earnings growth that surpassed the upper end of the guidance ranges.  Revenue grew 31% sequentially to $841 million in the March quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.27. Gross bookings in March were $833 million, coming in at the lower end of the guidance range, with the shortfall largely attributable to a shift in the timing of one large order into the June quarter.  In general, the semi cap equipment demand environment is healthy today. Device manufacturers are maintaining a high level of investment at the leading edge in their efforts to support technology development and to meet robust and demand forecast associated with the rapidly growing mobile electronics markets.  As a result of these technology and demand trends, the rate of change in device and process technology remains strong and continues to accelerate. In fact, the introduction of new transistor and memory technologies, such as high-k in metal gate and thin FET in logic and 3D NAND in memory, as well as advanced manufacturing and packaging techniques, are all contributing to driving higher technology development and manufacturing cost for our customers.  These technologies and techniques are also compounding the yield challenges at the leading edge, helping to drive strong adoption of process control. This is translating to market-leading growth for KLA-Tencor, as advanced process control becomes increasingly important for our customers. And the industry continues to look to KLA-Tencor as the market leader to meet their increasing complex inspection and measurement challenges at the leading edge.  Our strong market position was recently highlighted in Gartner's annual industry market research report. That study shows KLA-Tencor is growing share in process control, with particular strength in the wafer inspection and metrology markets, both of which are on the critical path for enabling next-generation device innovation.  Today's strong financial results and our industry-leading position are a direct outcome of KLA-Tencor's ongoing customer collaboration focus and the successful execution of our long-term strategic objectives.  I'll now provide an update on the current demand environment in each of our major end markets. Orders from foundry customers were 55% of gross bookings in the March quarter. Leading edge foundry capacity remains in tight supply, as rapid growth in the mobility markets is driving demand for increasingly complex fabless application processors into the foundries.  In this environment, foundry market leaders are ramping production in an effort to meet high levels of demand and to secure their positions in an increasingly competitive market.  Looking ahead, foundry demand is expected to remain high, and comments earlier today from one of the leading foundries suggest that they intent to increase their 2012 CapEx budget, which should support this trend as we move ahead in the year.  Strong foundry industry CapEx favors KLA-Tencor, as these customers tend to be the highest adopters of process control due to the heightened yield requirements unique to their high-index short time-to-market business model.  Logic was 16% of new orders in March. Logic investment today is focused on ramping 22-nanometer processors to high-volume and development of next-generation technology at the sub 20-nanometer node. Driven by competitive dynamics surrounding the future intersection of x86 and ARM-based processors for mobility applications, we expect Logic investment to remain at a high level in calendar 2012.  Memory bookings grew 29% of orders in March, with orders from NAND customers representing 60% of the memory orders. Mobility are driving NAND growth rate, and capacity growth in NAND remains modest, as NAND customers are investing in leading-edge technology to advance their competitive and cost strategies.  Finally, though DRAM investment remained modest in the March quarter, our second half calendar forecast for 2012 shows higher levels of DRAM investment. DRAM industry CapEx is expected to remain focused primarily on technology migrations.  Now to provide some perspective on the industry landscape for the remainder of calendar 2012. Growth from mobility markets, the high pace of innovation at the leading edge and competitive dynamics are all driving a high level of capital investment by our customers and sustaining a healthy business environment with strong order momentum.  In this environment, KLA-Tencor continues to perform at a high level with strong adoption on our core markets and strengthening market position, driving greater-than-industry growth rate for the company.  Looking ahead to the remainder of calendar 2012, current industry forecast predict that demand for capital equipment will continue to be strong and will remain focused on capacity ramps in the leading edge, logic and foundry, with technology development remaining a priority for market leaders across all of our end markets.  As a result, another good year for capital equipment spending is expected in the year, with total industry capital investment now projected to be flat to down 5% compared with a very strong 2011. Given this industry backdrop and with our backlog, the high demand for our new products and adoption at the leading edge, we are currently projecting revenue growth for KLA-Tencor in the 2012 calendar year that significantly outpaces the industry.  Turning now to our guidance for the June quarter. The Q4 demand picture looks similar to the March quarter, with the investment focused on leading edge technology development and concentrated among the market leaders, with continued strong momentum among the foundry and logic customers.  Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $775 million to $950 million. We are also projecting revenue and earnings growth with the June quarter expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.38.  In conclusion, we see calendar 2012 as another year of industry-leading growth and financial performance for KLA-Tencor, as our market leadership, our new products and the increasing adoption of process control all position the company to continue to perform at a higher level.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers and the outlook. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll remind you that we present our income statement in 2 formats: one, under U.S. GAAP; and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring related charges and credits, and any costs of credits which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items.  There was a $0.06 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information. Where I mention GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.  Q3 new orders were $833 million. Net orders were $816 million and were down about 14% from last quarter.  The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 22% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 8% of new systems orders, up from 2% in Q2; Japan was 11%, up from 9% last quarter; Korea was 39%, up from 28% last quarter; Taiwan was 13%, down from 39% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 7%, up from 3% in Q2.  The distribution in new orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 54%, compared with 47% last quarter; reticle inspection was 6%, down from 13% last quarter; metrology was 19%, down from 22% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 4%, up from 3% last quarter; and service was 17% of new orders in Q3, up from 15% last quarter.  Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: 55% of new systems orders in Q3 were for foundry customers, compared with 57% in Q2; logic customers were 16% of new semi-orders in Q3 versus 27% in Q2; and memory orders were 29% in Q3, up from 16% last quarter.  Looking forward, we expect new orders for Q4 will be within a range of $775 million to $950 million. In Q3, we shipped $818 million versus $700 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $820 million and $880 million in Q4.  Total backlog at the end of Q3 decreased by $23 million from December 31, and we ended the quarter with about $1.34 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2012, included $313 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.  Total revenue for Q3 was $841 million, up 31% from $642 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q3 was up $200 million to $701 million overall, and the services revenue was $139 million, down about $3 million from Q2. Our expected Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.3% in the March quarter, down slightly from 58.4% last quarter, as margin improvement from higher revenue was offset by product mix and product transition-related inventory reserves.  For Q4, we are expecting gross margins between 58.5% and 59.5%. Operating expenses were $199 million in Q3, compared with $207 million in Q2. Research expenses were $109 million in Q3, down $6 million from Q2, driven by the timing of materials for purchases for next-generation platforms.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $90 million in Q3, down almost $2 million from Q2. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be up slightly from Q3. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, down about $2 million from Q2. The change in OIE from last quarter was mostly related to a $1 million charge in Q2 to write down a nonmarketable investment. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q4.  In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $65 million, or 23% of pretax income versus 22% rate in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are using our intermediate term planning rate of 26% in arriving at Q4 non-GAAP EPS.  Non-GAAP net income was $216 million, or $1.27 per share in Q3, up from $0.72 a share last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 26%, Q3 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.22 per share. At the revenue range I previously mentioned in using a tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.20 and $1.38 per share. The weighted average share count used to compute EPS in Q3 was $170.1 million versus $169.1 million in Q2.  During Q3, we spent $67 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares. And as of March 31, 2012, we had approximately 4.6 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization.  We also paid $59 million in dividends in Q3. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q4. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $171 million for Q4.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at just under $2.4 billion, up about $190 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $262 million in Q3, compared with $187 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $638 million, up from $544 million at the end of December.  DSOs were 69 days at March 31 versus 77 days at December 31. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in foundry . Net inventories increased by $11 million from December 31 and ended the quarter at $659 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAPP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q3 versus 1.7 turns in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3, down $1 million from Q2. Total headcount, March 31, 2012, was 5,655, up from 5,593 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4.  In summary, our guidance for Q4 is: new orders between $775 million and $950 million; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million and non-GAAP earnings between $1.20 and $1.38 per share, assuming a tax rate of 26%.  This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]  And so, Steven, we are ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the pushout that you talked about whether in logic, foundry or memory. Was the pushout related to end demand or was it related to other constrains like availability of other equipment like lithography or facilities? How should we think about that?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. The pushout was actually just a timing issue, and the orders have since been processed. So it was really not related to any end demand, just getting things through your system.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, In terms of the foundries that are placing these huge CapEx numbers, from your vantage point, do you think that it's a mixture of both true end demand as well as improvement in yield? Or do you think the yield has a preload run rate if the CapEx does to increase to meet the demand? And I had a follow-up, too.
Richard P. Wallace: I think it is definitely the case. Our customers have a lot of demand for leading edge in the foundry world, and I think that's driving a lot of the activity we're seeing. And the yields, 32 nanometers are not great, and they're lower than that at 28. And I think there's also development work driving business for us at 20 nanometers. So -- and I have met with most of them in the last 90 days. And for sure, they're seeing strong demand based on kind of broad-based market pull, whether it be 4G or LTE chip sets, graphics, or processors, to support mobility, and it's at multiple customers. But there's certainly yield issues associated with both metrology and inspection, which is why I think KLA-Tencor's performing disproportionally well in this environment.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: If I could squeeze a follow-up for Mark. You said the OpEx is increasing in June. How do we think of that going forward or how do we think about the incremental operating margin going forward as you start doing other investments?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes, 2 responses to that. The OpEx, we're anticipating at least based upon what we know today that the OpEx will continue to increase into next year as we prepare for a next-generation product development. It's probably going to be more pronounced on the research and development side than it is on the G&A side, but there will be a little bit of G&A growth as well. I still think you're looking at a few million dollars of quarter increase, as we move into next year. At least that's our mindset as of today. If things change, we'd certainly update you, but that's certainly our framework for today.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citi.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: When I look at the composition of your orders that you reported, it seems like there was a follow-up in logic orders but conversely a pickup in some of the memory orders. Can you describe the composition of these memory orders and what you're seeing in general in terms of behavior among your memory customers?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, sure, Terence. I think that you're right. We saw memory picked up to about 29%. And if you look back in December, we're at 16%. So pretty significant increase there, largely in NAND and mostly technology-related dealing with some of the new yield challenges they have and metrology challenges at the advanced node. Logic, we did see lower logic, and I think that it's always -- logic tends to be kind of lumpy because there aren't that many players, and it's just where we are in the order cycle with them. And in fact, we don't see logic getting stronger as we go out in the June quarter. Probably, it'd be later in the year before we see logic pick up. So I think for now, in fact, we're forecasting logic down even further as a percent of total next quarter, with foundry actually picking back up.
Terence R. Whalen - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And as a quick follow-up, do you expect the second half memory orders to be stronger than the first half?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. We do see some signs of strengthening in DRAM for technology. I wouldn't say for capacity. And we'll see a little bit of that in the June quarter, as we forecast a little bit more activity going forward in DRAM. And I think the second half, again, technology-related, we do expect memory to pick up some, but we also see strength in the foundries. And as I said, we'll see logic, we believe, coming later in the calendar year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.
Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Olga calling in for C.J. Just a follow-up on the 2 previous questions. You highlighted pretty solid visibility for foundry strengths through the rest of the year, expectations for logic to pick up in the second half and memory as well. So on a NAND basis, can you just talk about how you expect shipment and orders to be weighted first half versus second half?
Richard P. Wallace: You know, we really -- we're not in a great position to guide for the entire year. But when we do look out, we see CapEx in general for the year to be flattish to maybe down a few percent. And so from that standpoint, when you look back at the 2 compares, you do have to see some overall strengthening happening in the second half. And with our backlog situation, the model we gave, the guidance we gave for the next quarter, I think you could see we're normally at a book-to-bill about 1, if you take the midpoint on those ranges. And so we expect to be able to continue to do that. But probably we'd like to support our customer base as we think about the demands they have to ramp quickly. So all our efforts are on ramping, manufacturing, and we're really supply-constrained right now to be able to support our customer base.
Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then specific to, I guess, process control intensity, given the continued yield issues that foundry and you've recently highlighted yield issues emerging in the NAND side as well, could we see process control intensity actually exceed 15% this year, or would it still be in the 14% to 15% range?
Richard P. Wallace: I think it's hard to get that precise on it as we go forward. I think it does depend somewhat on the complexion of the different customers that we're working in and their timing. But we've definitely seen since last year -- through last year, we saw an increase in intensity. Some customers are further along in their understanding of their challenges than others. There are a couple of other sectors that are low right now from a process control standpoint that we expect to pick up late in the year. And those -- reticle inspection is not particularly strong right now, and that's more just driven by the dynamics of that market. And the wafer manufacturers are not strong. So kind of in those 2 realms, we think there's more opportunity for intensity to increase. But that's not really happening in our next 90-day outlook.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I do apologize if you touched on this. I was a little late hopping over from one of the other calls, but it's kind of a bigger picture question. Just you guys are uniquely positioned, I think, to comment on some of the differences and some of the similarities between the yield issues that happened at 45-nanometer, especially at some of the foundry customers and then the yield issues that are happening today. What do you think is similar? What do you think is different about these yield challenges that those customers are facing in this cycle?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I think, mainly, probably the bigger one is related to metrology. I think that there are a number of challenges people are facing in yield in general that we saw at 45, which plays to the defectivity. But there are some uniqueness associated with the metrology product lines that we have with multiple patterning happening and increased intensity and some of the 3D thin FET structures driving more metrology. So I'd say that the intensity goes up, and it's driven as much by increase in metrology as it is by the ongoing challenges of defectivity.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So -- I'm sorry. I think understood that, but the issue just -- from KLA-Tencor standpoint, it's just the issues that they're facing require more metrology than the issues the 45-nanometer yield challenges created. Is that what you're saying?
Richard P. Wallace: Exactly. Metrology is a bit more stressed than it was at 45, which is I think why the overall intensity goes up.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I see. And is there a simple way to explain the technical issue that drives that increase in metrology?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, the fact that you have to do multiple patterning because EUV is late. And I think that they're definitely more critical layers which just drive -- so the requirements for overlay and the requirements for FinFET drive more metrology. There's also strong defectivity, but we had strong defectivity challenges back at 45 as well. That's what kickstarted a lot of our business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, just a follow-up on the last question. Is the mix of architecture types that are going through the foundries -- big die, consumer chips, et cetera, is that a material factor in some of the yield issues? Or is it more around the node transition and less about particular architectures, be it graphics or processors, et cetera?
Richard P. Wallace: No, it's definitely related to die size and geometry, Raj. You have both things happening, and I think it's more analogous to what happened to processors, microprocessors, in the '90s when they were getting both larger die but at the same time smaller dimensions. We're seeing that in mobility, driven by slightly different factors. One is a drive for less power. But it is definitely the case that the die are getting bigger and the yield challenges associated with that more pronounced, especially as they go to smaller design rules.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: A quick follow-up if I might. The comment you made on the trajectory in the second half, what were you suggesting about the order trajectory? I think I understood what you said on shipments. But were the orders being expected flattish or would they be down? And does that include the incremental TSMC spending that they announced today?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, Raj, it's -- I mean, as I said, we don't like to model what the second half is going to look like at this point. It's really tough for us. But we do see a lot of good indicators out there in terms of the conversations we're having with customers in both the foundry space -- and there are many people who said foundries were going to fall off 3 quarters ago, and we see ongoing strength. And I think it's driven by this mobility drive. We have multiple players supporting that, including a big foundry increasing their CapEx today. We don't that is necessarily the end of that. But at the same time, we do have some opportunities because of the process challenges associated with the latest generation NAND and what we believe will be in DRAM. So on balance, I also think there's some capacity opportunities as we get wafer manufacturers turned back on, and that's going to take a while. But we're -- it's too soon to model. We have an overall view for the year relative to last year, flat to down 5. But I don't want to get into a specific guidance for the second half at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: You mentioned supply chain constraints. I'm just wondering if your lead times are starting to extend at this point? And if so, what are they? And I was also hoping to -- can you sort of characterize your bookings concentration among your customers? Is it broadening out or is it still fairly concentrated with 1 or 2 customers?
Richard P. Wallace: Okay I'll take the 2 in the order you gave them. The first one, the supply constraints are really driven by the ability to get parts. It's not so much our space issues or talent. We've got the people. It's a matter of pulling the supply chain, and we've had a dramatic ramp. For us, it's kind of the usual suspects. It's going to be around optics. It's around illumination sources, whether they'd be laser or broadband. And it's really related to critical components which have longer lead time. And we've done -- and our suppliers have done a great job of ramping up to support us, but demand far exceeded what we had originally modeled. So we're playing catch-up. I would say that we're doing a good job of that. In terms of order, breadth is really among the logic and foundry players, and it's broad among logic and foundries as it was last quarter. What's slower, and we saw a little bit pickup in memory, but what's slower is there's just not a lot of action in DRAM. We do expect to see some of that. There's not much in the wafer manufacturers. There's not much, actually, in the reticle manufacturers right now. And so it is broad among foundries and logic on advanced nodes; not really very broad anywhere else.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Blansett with JPMorgan.
William C. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: This is Bill Peterson calling in for Chris. When looking in -- if you look at back maybe a year ago compared to the revenue run rates these days, it looks like the gross margins are around 100, maybe to 200 basis points lower. Can you provide any color around that? Is it related to customer mix, product mix? You're alluding to, for example, a lack of reticle and wafer. But I'm wondering what are the key moving parts within that?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes. Bill, this is Mark. You actually hit on one of them. We're categorizing mix, the customer mix, which includes the merge mashups [ph]. And we are seeing in terms of the margin pressure that we've experienced and this went up versus a year ago, Basically, it's mostly attributable to product mix. There is a little bit of volume component in terms of the big customers, and at least in this quarter, we had a product transition that pressured the inventory reserves a little bit more than what we've experienced in at least the last 5 or 6 quarters. So a combination of those 3 factors. But I would largely attribute it to the mix of products that we're shipping right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you just talk about the concentration of orders by different segments of foundries -- foundry, memory and logic, in the June quarter? And also, with respect to 20 nanometers spending, are you seeing just one customer spending or placing orders on that node? Or are you seeing multiple customers on that as well?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, I'll take those in reverse order. We're definitely seeing multiple on 20 nanometer, but they're different stages, I would think of maturity. But we are seeing R&D related work for 20. In terms of forecasting what we see right now for June by end customer, memory we think is around 21%. With actually, most of that being, as we're forecasting right now, DRAM related. Logic at 12%, and foundry picking back up to 67% percent, and the non-semi at about 5%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions, Rick. So when you talked about significant outperformance in calendar 12, how should we think about in terms of your individual product lines between wafer inspection, metrology and reticle inspection? And I have a follow-up.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think we're doing pretty well across the board in terms of relative -- when we look at market share. We're talking more in general about the overall performance KLA-Tencor from a revenue perspective relative to the overall industry, where we see process control strengthening as we go forward for all the reasons we've talked about in the past. But also we have gained share, and so that puts us at a great position to support our customers as we go forward. There are great opportunities for us in metrology. I mentioned the double patterning, more layers, but also the challenges of defectivity. So right now, it's pretty broad. As I said earlier, I think the areas that are slower, that may pick up but won't then be on for most of this calendar year, relate to wafer manufacturers. And there's been some softening in overall investment by the reticle manufacturers at this point, which may pick up later in the year.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And on the -- one of your key customers is starting to work on the 40-nanometer, and you guys are well exposed on the R&D side. Where do you see clearly this would become incremental opportunities that could drive particularly in the second half? Any specific details on that one?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that the advanced node work continues to challenge our customers. There's definitely work on now with 40-nanometer. When we think about the early phases of development, it tends to favor tools like the very advanced wafer inspection tools. Sometimes the e-Beam tools will get pulled into that. And there are -- we do have tools that are perhaps more related to capacity, and those tend to come during the ramp phase as opposed to the development phase. But we are seeing that demand right now and working closely with our customers on the tool sets to support their R&D.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just one quick follow-up on the reticle inspection. When do you think it can bounce back?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, probably not for a couple of quarter. I mean we had a strong placement of a number of the 6xx product line when we introduced that. We're doing very well from a share perspective, but we do forecast another relatively softer quarter in the June, and we would expect in the second half to see more activity in reticle. But right now, it is definitely lower than it has been in prior quarters. Because of the size of those orders and the capital intensity of that equipment, that tends to be pretty lumpy, and we forecast that going forward as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I just had a couple of quick questions. The first one, I'm just curious, looking longer-term over the next 2 or 3 years, I'm wondering if you can give us an idea which process control markets are most optimistic about in terms of growth or profit contribution.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that the dynamics of foundry continue to play to KLA-Tencor. I think we're an important ingredient in anybody that's running at a high-mix environment and has a lot of process change. And I think that overall dynamics of the mobility markets support our business pieces that they're going to need more inspection than measurement. I would say that the DRAM less intensive and probably not a huge contributor to our progress going forward. I think that NAND, however, is because of the technology associated with, especially the 3D NAND work that's going on. So if I had to pick -- and logic continues to be, but logic, of course, is starting to blur with foundry if you look at the dynamics. I think over 2 to 3 years, logic looks more like foundry as the main logic players move to support the mobility market. And I think for us, the strength will be in those markets, less so in the DRAM market.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: And how about just from a equivalent standpoint or a segment standpoint or segment standpoint, which products are you most optimistic about in terms of generating growth?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think that the demonstrated value that we've seen in our metrology, especially around multiple patterning, which drives both the overlay business and registration business but also the films business, is strong. I don't see any change in that because the complexity associated with that goes. And then defectivity. I think that there's no question that our strength in technology advancement in both the main platforms there, the Brightfield, the Darkfield, but also the bare wafer, are all well positioned to support advanced technology nodes. So I wouldn't say one is particularly stronger than the other when it comes to those 3 categories. But we do see big opportunities, and we're seeing it now when we provide more capability on the advanced design rules' defectivity. A lot of it is customers then learn what they've been missing, and that's part of what caught us by surprise with the big demand is they got a hold of a new technology. And of course, we heavily investing in R&D, and we'll be bringing out next-generation. We've got at least a 5-year roadmap mapped out in our key product lines, where we have developments going on that will be bringing out new capabilities to support the market as we go forward.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, if I could just real quickly on the service revenue line. That's trended down for 3 quarters, it looks like. I'm just wondering if that starts to flatten out, maybe improved through the back half of the year?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes, I'd be happy to talk to that. A couple of things are happening there. First of all, we did have the OPD interruption this quarter, which cost us about $3 million in the top line. The second thing is that where we lightened up over the last, I would say, 2 to 3 quarters, is in what we call our billable work, which is where customers aren't on contracts. Most of the new tool customers are buying contracts that come along so that they can service the tool in its most intense initiation period of usage. So we do think that at least part of that effect was when Japan went through the tsunami last year. We had an intense increase in that particular region in billable. That has now subsided, that those customers have stabilized. So we suspect that we will begin to grow in the services revenue line in our fiscal Q4. We would expect that the growth to return to sort of normal trajectories as we move into next year. But those 2 phenomenon did have an impact on us over the last 2 to 3 quarters.
Richard P. Wallace: And to just add to that, I think that you're well aware that utilization at the leading edge is very high. But the utilization at the trailing edge is actually softer and that more tightly correlates to the service business than the leading edge does. So the systems business outperforms during that time period, in addition to the factors that Mark highlighted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of this Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a question on your thoughts of technology upgrades versus capacity expansion in NAND. If you compare the state of foundry, logic is capacity-driven now. Memory is technology-driven now. But both could be more capacity-heavy as that we haven't -- the second half of the year? Is that kind how you're planning KLA?
Richard P. Wallace: Stephen, right. I think that's generally -- I might modify it a little. There's no question that there is technology happening in the foundries as well. Particularly in the areas of the advance design rules and that's a big catalyst for growth for us. But no question that memory right now is about technology, and it's also where we see capacity when we talk about the wafer manufacturers, which have been very, very slow. The only purchases we've seen in our wafer manufacturers have been associated with technology, indicating that we believe there'll be opportunity once they, too, resume their growth. But right now, there's -- it's all about technology. And I'd say the one kind of in the middle is NAND as it deals with advanced technology, and we're hoping to see some improvement in capacity later on NAND.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Two questions. One, if you look at the order guidance, if you didn't have that pushout with your order guidance have pretty much just been flat then at the midpoint?
Richard P. Wallace: I think that's right.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then when you talk about the DRAM strength, are you just talking about the June quarter or do you have some visibility beyond the June quarter on DRAM?
Richard P. Wallace: We don't have a lot of visibility beyond it. We do see some June activity. But as you know, I'm sure you know, there've been a couple of disruptions in DRAM, if you just look at some of the players that have caused to able to tap the brakes. One player didn't have really any access to capital, and the other one had a big financial problem. So that kind of froze everybody. Since then, you have one that's going through the process, and we think there'll be some resolution when it comes to the bankruptcy in Elpida, and the other one is merger completed in Korea, which means at least some of the CapEx. So we'll see technology, we're definitely seeing signs of that in the current quarter, and then we expect that later in the year, we'll see some resumption of capacity investment or more technology. But we're not talking about big numbers. I mean, it's been almost off. So we're talking about off of a very low base.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And one final one. On the reticle inspection, you commented that, I guess, it will be slow for the a little while before you expect to see it pick up. Is the pick up around 22 nanometers then? Is 28 nanometer essentially done for reticle inspection?
Richard P. Wallace: I think there's 2 ways to think about it. There's definitely -- there's some truth about that the -- we sold a number of our 6xx series. The other thing is there is going to be some fab line business that becomes available. But when the yields are low on the advanced design rule, there's less business in the fab for some of the reticle business, so we see less business there until the yield issues really get ramped. And so I think that those are kind of 2 factors associated with that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok from Needham & Co.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, so I noticed that your metrology order is down for the quarter. Was that due to just timing or is this specifically related to certain end market? Can you help us over that?
Richard P. Wallace: We're down but above -- down quarter-on-quarter, but they're running a little bit higher than they had historically. I think it was also -- frankly, the strength of the wafer inspection makes it as a percent come up. But yes, there's timing associated with that. Some of that we'll see as we go forward. And then it's also associated with some strength in wafer displacing NAND.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: I see. It's just a mix issue then. And then a question on the NAND side, I guess some of your peers has talked about NAND looks like it's going to be softer this year than a lot of, I guess, a lot of you were predicting for the year. Have you guys seen that softness in NAND or do you think you might not see that because you're more tied to margins than [indiscernible] these capacities [indiscernible] can you help us out on that?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, there's no question on NAND. On capacity, it has been slow, and we don't expect that to change much. Where we have seen some business and had a reasonable quarter in the March quarter was associated technology, but as we said, going forward, even in the June quarter, we expect to see NAND as a smaller percentage of a smaller number. So I agree that we don't see a tremendous amount of investment in NAND either except for some technology.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: I think Rick, you may have kind of touched on this in one of the prior questions. I just want to get it clear. With some of the challenges emerging in memory manufacturing, particularly on the NAND side of things, where vertical NAND structures are forthcoming. Where do you see the process control intensity for you guys in terms of either metrology and inspection? Do you see metrology getting the bulk of those increased dollars or are there inspection opportunities as well?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, so there's 2 sides of it. One is the overlay challenges and the 3D structures when it comes to making film measurements are both going to drive metrology for us. When it comes to the defectivity associated with the advanced design rules, just smaller device but also the VNAND structure creates opportunity for the wafer inspection. The other thing we've seen is some opportunity for bare wafer into memory in places where we haven't necessarily seen adoption in the past. So we think that's some good opportunity for us to penetrate further in those markets. So I'd say the mix is pretty good, given that wafer is overall larger percent of our business than metrology. I think you'd probably equal weighting and increase in opportunity, which means the mix stays similar. But both go up as a result of the process complexity. And that's based on the preliminary data we're seeing now and what we're working with customers in their development.
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Two follow-up. I'm just trying to understand the dynamics of this pushout from March to June. And I apologize in advance if I'm beating the dead horse. But when I look at what we have heard from your customers and the customer's customers over the past couple of weeks, it seems like one measure of fabless company would have to redo the layout and come up with a new reticle set or mask set. Is that what could explain what led to this pushout?
Richard P. Wallace: No. The pushouts were related to just transferring of information and data, some pickups in IT. And we have since book the orders.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then June quarter has historically been your strongest quarter. So this push from March to June mix, this June quarter even bigger than historical trends and things of sequential changes?
Richard P. Wallace: Possibly. I mean, as we have a pretty wide range on June capturing that. Couple of things have happened. One, we're in pretty big numbers for us. And we're talking about a not that large customer base, which has always been true but it's especially true now. And so you have large orders from a few customers creating a large range and a certain amount of uncertainty. The thing that does give us some confidence is there's a high demand for spots, and so for us to be able to respond to support our customers, so we think we'll get more clarity as the quarter goes on. But I think as we have seen in the last few quarters, it's getting harder for us to have much visibility although we see demand just because we have a fewer number of buying a larger percent of the order book. And so I would say we're going to -- it will be right down to the wire and as it was at the end of March, and that's why we've given such a large range.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Would be fair to say that the visibility for your customers will actually become even more challenging later this year because there could be a process as they determine or evaluate what the demand would be next year. So could that lead to sort of a pause in booking patterns because visibilities are very limited and orders have become very lumpy?
Richard P. Wallace: I don't think so. I think that we're at kind of a pretty narrow visibility now, and I don't think it will get much worse. The only exception I would give you that the caveat is if you go back to a market situation where there is macroeconomic shock, then our bets are off. But I think we're living in a world now where our customers are driven by consumers. Many of our customers are not producing for their own needs but producing as foundries, and therefore, they have less visibility and therefore, we have less visibility. And I think it's unfortunately the new normal because I think foundries will dominate the CapEx spending because they're the ones really benefiting the most from the mobility work, which is where most of the business -- semiconductor growth certainly looks to be for the next several years.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Ed Lockwood for any closing comment.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining our call today.  With KLA-Tencor's December quarter results, we're pleased to report a very strong finish to a calendar year 2011, which was a record for the company. We saw industry growth in process control, an affirmation of our market leadership. Those forces helped the company achieve annual revenue growth in 2011 that outpaced the overall equipment industry by a wide margin.  Revenue in calendar year 2011 grew 27% to $3.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.70, an increase of 46% in the year. We generated $940 million in operating cash flow in 2011, ending with just under $2.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet on December 31. We continued to be proactive in returning value to shareholders in 2011, increasing the level of our quarterly dividend payout to $0.35 per share and returning 50% of our total annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase programs.  Looking at the summary results of the December quarter. Revenue and earnings in Q2 were both down sequentially as expected, finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance with revenue of $642 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.72 per diluted share. The big story for December was the sharp increase in quarterly bookings driven by a resurgence in equipment spending among foundry and logic customers, the relative strength of process control as a percentage of the overall equipment investment and customer acceptance of our latest generation products.  Gross bookings in Q2 were $950 million, an increase of 95% compared with September and the second highest quarterly bookings result in company history. Order activity was particularly strong in the final weeks of the quarter. The Q2 bookings profile featured the high level of demand for our next-generation technologies, with strength across all our major product lines, including record orders in metrology in the quarter.  In terms of the end market mix, foundry was 57% of new orders in December, focused on 28-nanometer ramps and capacity growth at 32 nanometer. Logic was 27% of Q2 orders with the majority of logic demand coming from a diversified chip manufacturer looking to increase their leading-edge logic capability. Memory was 16% of the total.  So clearly, a very strong result in December, capping a record calendar year for KLA-Tencor in 2011, and setting the stage for success in 2012. This performance showcases the strength of our market leadership and long-term strategic objectives and highlights industry adoption trends showing chip-makers relying increasingly on the latest inspection and measurement technologies to enable their competitive strategies at the leading edge.  Shifting gears for a minute, I'd like to highlight recent news on the new product front. One of the key factors underlying KLA-Tencor's market leadership has been our proven success in collaborating closely with our customers, anticipating the potential yield challenges in their leading-edge technology roadmaps and directing our product development activities to deliver differentiated solutions to address those challenges.  Today, I'm very pleased to highlight the latest fruits of those efforts, with news earlier this week announcing the launch of a suite of 3 new tools for our flagship Brightfield, Darkfield and e-Beam wafer inspection product lines. Each new platform incorporates significant advancements in many key enabling technology of leading-edge defect inspection. These technologies are designed to address the wide range of defect issues that new material structures and design rules are imposing on manufacturers of advanced chips. And we're very encouraged with the high level of customer interest we're seeing for these new technologies.  Moving on to our view of the current market environment and the trends we expect to play out in 2012. In general, the equipment demand environment today is very similar to what we've outlined throughout this cycle. Despite the persistent macro issues overhanging global economics, the fundamental factors fueling industry CapEx remains strong. The rapid consumer adoption of mobile platforms is driving high levels of foundry in logic CapEx with NAND flash investment eclipsing DRAM spend for the first time in this cycle. And of course, the pace of innovation at leading edge continues unabated, as our customers are innovating across a wide variety of technical, architectural and process approaches to differentiate and gain a competitive advantage. In this environment of mounting cost and complexity, process control plays a critical role in enabling our customers' success in executing their growth strategies. And we’re seeing an increased focus on inspection measurements of speed, yield learning and maximize revenue. This is being reflected in the higher adoption we're experiencing in our core markets and the strong relative growth exhibited by KLA-Tencor in calendar 2011.  For 2012, recent analyst estimates project a range of CapEx of flat to down 10% compared with 2011. Given the adoption growth, KLA-Tencor's strong competitive position and strong new product acceptance, we expect KLA-Tencor to once again outperform the industry in 2012.  Turning now to our guidance for the March quarter. The Q3 demand picture looks similar to the December quarter, with investments focused on leading edge technology development and concentrated primarily among the foundry and logic customers. Gross bookings are projected to be in the range of $825 million to $975 million. We are also projecting very strong sequential revenue and earnings growth, with March revenue expected to be in the range of $770 million to $830 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.18.  To conclude, we begin 2012 with great optimism as KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product demand and ongoing operational focus position the company to continue to perform at a high-level and deliver industry-leading growth and financial performance in calendar 2012.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we presented our income statement in 2 formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, restructuring-related charges and credits and in cost of credits, which are outside of our core operations including unusual tax items.  There was a $0.06 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information but where our reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. Reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.  Q2 new orders were $950 million and net orders were $948 million. Both order figures were up over 95% from last quarter and are very close to our historical quarterly highs. The regional distribution in new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: the U.S. was 19% of new systems orders in Q2, down from 25% from in the September quarter; Europe was 2% of new systems orders, down from 7% in Q1; Japan was 9%, up slightly from 8% last quarter; Korea was 28%, down slightly from 29% last quarter; Taiwan was 39%, up from 22% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 3%, down from 9% in Q1.  The distribution of new orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 47% compared to 28% last quarter; reticle inspection was 13%, down from 18% last quarter; metrology was 22%, up from 14% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 3%, down from 9% last quarter; and service was 15% of new orders in Q2, down from 31% last quarter.  And finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new orders in Q2 were for foundry customers, flat with Q1; logic customers were 27% of orders in Q2 versus 22% in Q1; and memory orders were 16% in Q2, down from 21% last quarter.  New orders in December quarter were technology focus with 56% of the orders received in the quarter targeted toward 28 nanometer and below design rules.  Looking forward, we expect that new orders in Q3 will be within the range of $825 million to $975 million. In Q2, we shipped $700 million versus $690 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $800 million and $860 million in Q3. Total backlog at the end of Q2 increased by about $306 million from September 30 and we ended the quarter with almost $1.4 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at December 31, 2011, included $333 million of revenue backlog, the products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and about $1.03 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped.  Total revenue for Q2 was $642 million, down 19% from $796 million last quarter. Systems revenue in Q2 was down 23% to $501 million. And services revenue was $142 million, down about $4 million from Q1.  Our expectation for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $770 million and $830 million.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.4% in the December quarter, about 40 basis points higher than the September quarter, as lower inventory reserve requirements offset the impact of lower revenue. For Q3, we are expecting gross margins between 58% and 59%.  Operating expenses were $207 million in Q2 compared with $198 million in Q1. Research and development expenses were $115 million in Q2, up $10 million from Q1, driven by material purchases for next-generation platforms.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $91 million in Q2, about even with Q1. We expect operating expenses in Q3 to be about flat with Q2 actuals. OIE was a net $13 million expense in Q2, up over $6 million from Q1. The change in OIE from last quarter was mostly due to a $4 million reserve release in Q1 following resolution of tax exposure and a $1 million change in Q2 due to a write-down of non-marketable investment. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q3.  In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $34 million or 22% of pre-tax income versus a 23% rate in Q1. Q2 tax expense percentage was lower than Q1, in large part, due to the distribution of taxable earnings between our U.S. and international entities. For guidance purposes, we've used our intermediate-term tax pointing [ph] rate of 26% in arriving at Q3 non-GAAP EPS.  Non-GAAP net income was $122 million or $0.72 per share in Q2, down from $1.17 per share last quarter. We applied our modeled tax rate of 26%. Q2 non-GAAP earnings would have been $0.68 per share. At the revenue range I previously mentioned and using the tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1 and $1.18 per share. The weighted-average share count used to compute EPS in Q2 was $169.1 million versus $169.8 million in Q1.  During Q2, we spent $63 million repurchasing about 1.4 million shares. And as of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 5.9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We also paid $58 million in dividends during Q2. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q3. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q3.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, up about $76 million from the end of September. Cash generated from operations was $187 million in Q2 compared to $219 million in Q1. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $544 million, up from $462 million at the end of September. DSOs were 77 days at December 31 versus 53 days at September 30, both DSO figures in net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factoring. Net inventories increased by $27 million from September 30 and ended the quarter at $640 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 1.7 turns in Q2 versus 2.1 turns in Q1. Capital expenditures were $15 million in Q2, up $3 million from Q1. Total headcount at December 31, 2011, was 5,593, up from 5,547 at September 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q3.  In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: new orders between $825 million and $975 million; total revenue between $770 million and $830 million; non-GAAP earnings between $1 and $1.18 per share, assuming a tax rate of 26%.  This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Thanks, Mark. We'll now take your questions. And we once again request each participant to limit to 1 question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get as many callers as possible in the time that we have allocated today.  With that, operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix of orders by device segment and geography that you expect in the March quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, sure. Well, what we're looking forward at March, we see continued strength in foundry. So we think foundry stays at about in the 50s. We have it modeled right now at about 53%. We do expect an increase in memory to about 31% and logic at 16%. And the split of memory is a little bit weighted toward the NAND, probably in the 57%, 60% NAND and then about 5% of non-semi.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got you. Anything to note in terms of geographical concentration of orders in the March quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, March, we continued to expect it to be relatively broad. I think the 3 kind of main reasons for us right now, U.S. continued strength. We see about 21% in the U.S. Taiwan, we think, will be -- continue to be strong at about 26%. And we expect Korea in the 24% and then pretty good participation from some of the other regions as well but those are the 3 big ones.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Got you. And in terms of this uptick you're seeing in memory, which is pretty interesting, historically that's been lagging somewhat in terms of process control adoption and you're sort of seeing a good uptick in December and a stronger one, I guess, into March. Could you talk a little bit about what sort of driving trends in NAND that's perhaps driving more adoption? Or do you think it's this NAND CapEx is sort of going up a bit for the industry?
Richard P. Wallace: I think there's 2 things. One is, metrology. We had a record quarter in metrology, all-time company record in metrology last quarter and that becomes very important in memory, particularly, more so perhaps even in NAND. So that looks to be strong and we continue to see that as we go forward. The other thing is some of our advanced inspection products are performing extremely well and what we're finding is that in some of the vertical structures, our inspection tool and our review tool are uniquely differentiated and customers are now seeing that, that, provides value. In fact, in some cases, there's some customers that bought our advanced tools for their logic work and realized testing on memory that it had additional capability. They hadn’t understood what they've been missing and so we're seeing some proliferation as a result of that. So a very strong product demand on the inspection side supporting particularly NAND.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: A couple of questions. Number 1, in terms of bookings for both December and March, did you see any orders for 20 nanometer and below?
Richard P. Wallace: Not so much for 20. Our customers are always looking forward. I'd say the bulk of the orders really are 32 build-out for production and 28 for development. I'd say, there's probably some 28 per ramp. There's definitely some development work that's going on in 20. In fact, even people looking forward to 14 or 18, depending on who they are. But by and large, heavily dependent on 28 nanometer right now.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it, got it. And then, in terms of the memory, I just want to touch on that, too, for a second. I understand it's going some like in the 90 or 65 all the way to like 3x nanometer. You're inspection and your metrology touch points actually doubled. So are we actually just buying more of the same equipment or do you have to retool the whole fab at 3x and sub-3x nanometer?
Richard P. Wallace: No. It's new equipment, and what we're seeing, in particular, I highlighted a couple of products that are really working. The one we mentioned in the call prepared remarks is the new suite of products. We've got the new Brightfield tool, the new Darkfield tool and the e-Beam review. I think all of those are very exciting results what we're seeing in memory and as I said earlier, customers starting to see and discover problems they didn't know they had. And so I think that's the discovery process is going on and that's driving additional demand. So right now, frankly, our biggest challenge is meeting demand.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terence Whalen with Citigroup.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This is Wenge Yang for Terence. A question about gross margin and revenue is up roughly 25%, if I take the midpoint but the gross margin is pretty much flat. I just want to hear what's the read in that gross margins not expanding with the revenue.
Mark P. Dentinger: Well, the revenue was down quarter-on-quarter, and in fact, I explained in my preferred remarks, it's down about $150 million. And yet, gross margin is actually slightly improved and the reason was is that they -- we -- the capacity release was actually offset by the fact that we actually had lower inventory reserves requirements in this quarter. So what you should see is the result of these 2 phenomena and as we move forward and the revenue improves, you should see some slight improvements in the gross margin moving forward.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. So a couple of things in terms of gross margin. One is the customer consolidation, do you see actually additional pressure on the pricing front that could pressure your gross margin? On the other side, you have some new products going out. Does that help your gross margin in terms of added capacity -- capability to your new tools?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. I never viewed consolidation as impacting gross margin. I think gross margin is really a measure of how unique and differentiated your products are. And if you're able to maintain differentiation and create value for customers, you're going to get the gross margin. And that's what we saw in the quarter that we had and we expect that going forward. And it's a function of our cycle of heavy investment in R&D-differentiated products creating a lot of value for our customers. So I don't think it's a function of consolidation. I think it's a function of differentiation.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. In terms of a product -- the new product, does that impact your gross margin positively?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, as Mark said, we expect to see gross margins improving over time, as revenue goes back up but we continue with the model that we established some years ago in terms of incremental margin. And from our standpoint, a lot of that is driven by operational efficiency but we're pretty happy with our relative position in gross margin in the industry and pretty heavily focused on maintaining and improving that. But we feel pretty good about where we are.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Just 1 quick follow-up. What is the schedule for your e-Beam reticle inspection tool?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, right now, we're still in development but our expectation is that we've got EUV capability built in the Teron platform that we've got now. We'll be able to meet industry demand for several years with the product that we have and then we're in development. And we're fully confident we'll be in position when EUV goes to production to support it with an actinic tool.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.
Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Olga. Given the substantial uptick in your orders in the December quarter, do you still plan on managing your backlog to approximately 6 months or do you expect this magnitude of orders to really drive more of an extension on how you manage your backlog?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, at the current levels of both the new order activity and production, we're just actually running to keep that pace right now. It's pretty high. If the new order activity were to go up, you can see with our expected shipment and revenue activity for Q3, you could actually see the backlog increase slightly but our focus right now is to actually get the new tools built and out to customers as quickly as possible. But as you can imagine, that puts a lot of stress on vendors. The factories are full and we're doing everything we can to keep up. We're certainly not intentionally trying to grow it but it is a byproduct of the new order activity and how fast we can get it out.
Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then just a follow-up question on your outlook for 2012. Given the predominance of foundry and logic and the mix especially in the next few quarters and the need for them to really improve their yields, how do you think about process control intensity this year? And following up on that, given your attraction with metrology and NAND, how do you think about your market share this year as well?
Mark P. Dentinger: Olga, 2 great questions. And based on what we're seeing actually, through this cycle, not just in the last quarter, but foundry demand being strong because they really need what we provide and we're uniquely positioned to do that. And they're facing some real yield challenges. We expect 2012 to be another strong year for KLA-Tencor and one where we'll outpace the industry. It's really anyone's bet how the industry is going to do. I think that some of the recent announcements show CapEx nudging upwards overall and predominantly in areas that should support KLA-Tencor business. So we're well prepared to outperform the industry again in 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Rick, I guess, the first question would be the breadth of your customers seems a lot better than the rest of the industry and ultimately, one would think those 2 things kind of have to tie together. And so could you give us a little bit of perspective on historically, when we've seen sort of the lack of breadth outside of KLA but such good breadth within KLA before and then kind of what's happened on either side of that?
Richard P. Wallace: Jim, great question. I think the phenomenon that's going on right now has to do with what's going on in the markets that are being served in the mobility play. In particular, what's happening is what we're seeing. Die size is increasing. And Jim, you and I both remember when die size used to increase but it's been a while. And to satisfy the mobility market, what you're seeing is the processors are getting bigger, supporting smartphones, supporting tablets. And that creates a unique advantage for KLA-Tencor because it means the yield becomes much more critical for these guys. They might have capacity. In fact, we know they've got capacity at older generations. But on the new stuff, they've got to get it up and they got to get yielding, and it's right in the sweet spot for us. So I think that's a lot of what we're seeing right now. And the foundry wars that are going on -- it really based about mobility. We checked in about half our business has been driven by the PC server market and the other half is now being driven by a foundry, driving the support of tablets and smartphones. And those are growing at a rapid pace and so our view is we will be the big winners in that.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then I guess -- that's very helpful. And then, relative -- your June quarter is usually a very, very strong quarter because it's a seasonal -- yes, it's your fiscal year end. On the other side of that, you're coming off a tremendous performance now. I mean, how would you expect sort of the year to play out from the sequential basis for modeling purposes?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, as we said, we think we'll outperform the industry again in 2012, that's certainly our plan. Very hard to handicap what the overall industry is going to do. But I'd say the segments that are likely to invest, all the signals that we're getting for our customers, certainly play to our strength. And I'd say, in particularly, what we're seeing in foundry logic, and also even in NAND, as NAND increases. I think DRAM is likely to remain soft throughout the year. I just don't see a tremendous driver for that business. So we feel pretty bullish about it, very hard to handicap June at this point.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: Rick, if I could follow up on the process control intensity question for a moment. Lots of talk in the industry, as people are beginning to scale 2X around whether or not it's scaling the way 4X did, if there's new issues or not. Curious on your perspective there, how 2X ramps compared to what you saw at 4X. I'm sure the sources of defect density are somewhat different, but how that compares. And then as you think about the process control intensity, and you mentioned that it appears to be going up in memory which we've been waiting for, for a while, any numbers you can put around that to kind of give some indication of the slope of improvement you might expect in the context to some of the trends you talked about over the next couple of years?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, to your question, new types. I don't think it's a function of necessarily new types. Many of the same types, the defects, but much smaller and devices that are much more sensitive to it. I mentioned -- I was talking to Jim that the die size getting bigger means that there is even an increased sensitivity to defectivity at the same level when you're trying ramp die size and shrink at the same time. The other thing though, and I want to stress this, is metrology has really kicked in. And we didn't necessarily see the same strength in metrology in the past. And the old tag line for K-T is, "If you can't measure it, you can't control it. And if you can't inspect it, you can't fix it." And I think both of those things are working to our favor right now. As far as NAND, I still think it's relatively early in the adoption cycle of what we're going to see as a percent of CapEx with NAND. We have some very encouraging signs. We are finding capabilities in our tools as we work closely with customers that are getting them excited about deploying them. But I think it’s early to say what the overall model is going to look like, but we certainly anticipate improvement off of where we've been in the past there.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: If I could, Mark. This is a follow-up. Could you comment on how to think about expense trajectory across the year? I know it’s early but maybe a comment there.
Mark P. Dentinger: No, it's not that -- we're certainly thinking about it, Raj. The truth of the matter is, right now, KLA is continuing to increase our hiring and we would anticipate that expenses -- the operating expenses are going to increase as the year goes on, not significantly initially, but we're anticipating towards the end of the year with new product introductions and whatnot. But we will have some increased operating expenses particularly in materials that we need to run in for new generation products. So that's our mindset right now. Of course, we have to be wary of what the industry and macro signals are as we move through the year. So you can take that guidance in the context of it's what we're seeing right now. But that's our mindset today, and certainly in support of a lot of the success we've had on the recent products, we don't -- we certainly don't want to us [indiscernible] the sales or the installation and support channels that we built up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: I guess on the prior call, you talked about having pretty good visibility -- order visibility through June. Obviously, the orders are coming in much stronger than expected. I think there was some -- maybe some pull-in from June to December and March. How should we think about the expense of your visibility at this point?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I guess our visibility wasn't quite as good as we thought, since it heated up quite a bit in December. What we see is a lot of interest. And what we're seeing now, the business that we got in the December quarter wasn't from June. I think what it was, was an increase in intensity by some of the customers that are chased really to meet the growing demand around devices that are very hot in the market, the mobility devices, smartphones and tablets. And that seems to continue to grow. So that's part of what we're seeing and when we had talked about the March guide. So we've kind of kicked into a new gear here, and I don't know how to handicap June based on that. We don't typically guide that far. But we're pretty confident that however the industry does, the overall industry perspective is flat to down 10. We feel pretty comfortable with our position that we ought to be able to outperform it. And with our business model, we ought to be able to financially perform very well in this year.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And can you give some indication as far as what product bookings, categories might be -- which might be stronger or weaker in the March quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we had a strong quarter, as I said, in metrology and a great quarter in wafer. We've really had a good quarter. I'd say, overall, we're handicapping, if I had to do that now, I'd say wafer, 51% at March; metrology at 16%; reticle at 11%; and our services business in the 17% range; and then the hard disk drive, another -- about 5%. That's how you ground it up. So metrology, not quite as strong; and reticle, not quite as strong; wafer, picking up; and service, picking up.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Blansett with JPMorgan.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Rick, I wanted to ask you about this trend of increasing die sizes and potentially lower yields -- effective yields and what you think this means to the footprint out there? And how much additional CapEx you might expect to offset this declining productivity basically trend [ph]?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I don't think our customers plan on doing anything but getting the yields up with the capacity that they have. That's why I think you're seeing us differentially perform in this market. So I think their expectation is they're going to get yields off of the die even if they're getting larger, and that's why I think we should get a higher percent of the CapEx. And so as we model -- we talked about it before, the CapEx inspection measurement increasing as a function of the overall, and we're certainly seeing signs of that now. We haven't fully demonstrated it in memory yet. We have early signs but we're definitely seeing it in the foundry space.
Christopher Blansett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then the second question was tied to your R&D spend. You talked about next-generation platforms, is this also starting to be the transition in the 450 in a more accelerated matter?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, certainly, we got development programs for 450 and we've just mapped out -- and we have a planning cycle we look out to 2015, and we've mapped out our investment from now through 2015 in all our major -- all our product lines, actually. And yes, over that time period, we've got major platforms being developed and we've got 450 coming in. We have -- so the first 450 capable tools now and we'll be shipping them in 2012, but I don't anticipate large scale manufacturing of any type in the several year timeframe, but certainly, investment on our behalf on 450.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you maybe elaborate a little on the yields under the customer is seeing right now? I know you said there were a lot of new customers lucky to use your tools. So maybe you could give us a sense on what's on the yields are in the foundry space today and when we can expect capacity rise [ph] to kick in?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we're -- Vishal, a good question. There aren't really new customers. I think -- again, we're pretty much solid to everybody and have been. I think there are customers with increasing adoption needs. In other words, we're putting -- deploying more inspection earlier in their development process and more of it to cover all the challenges they're facing. In yields, as always, range, we don't discuss individual customer yields. But certainly, on 28-nanometer, you've got a large range. But the biggest thing is, you got more design starts now and expectations in the market for 28-nanometer, just it's overheated. And so our customers are trying to be very responsive to the demands that are being placed on them. And there's clearly from their standpoint, the highest lever they can pull from a productivity standpoint, the cost standpoint, is to go after yields. And so we're seeing that as being an imperative that they have and one that we can help them with.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And in our NAND slide, I see an uptick from -- begins from a broader set of customers or just maybe 1 or 2 customers?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, there aren't that many NAND customers. So from that standpoint, we sold all of them, but the phenomena is the same across the board. I would say customer to customer, they have perhaps different issues. Some have slightly different approaches to yield management, but the underlying themes are the same when we talk to them. Defects, they worry about defects and vertical structures. They've certainly worried about metrology and that creates opportunities for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Piper Jaffrey.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions. First up, how should we think about in calendar '12 year-over-year growth between your wafer inspection segment and metrology given the backdrop of logic and foundry spending?
Richard P. Wallace: That's a great question. And as I said, we saw metrology really kicking up, and I expect that, that continues but we've got huge demand for wafer, too. So I think the mix we're talking about going forward, if you think about our overall business being, say, 50% wafer and 15% to 20% metrology is probably about right. Reticle is pretty lumpy so it kind of comes in and out depending on just a few unit sales. But I think that continues. Strong demand in both, but we're really excited about the metrology performance because we have seen a kick up, as I said recently. And I think really critical for our customers to get that new capability that we have.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Okay. And second one, I just wanted to follow-up, do you know what -- given that you ended calendar '11 with such strong performance, can you tell us what was your market share in process control as a whole in calendar '11, please?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. We looked at that. Year-on-year, we're kind of in the same range. So I think we gained a little bit of share over -- but we had a very strong calendar '10 also. So I'd say pretty similar. There are always puts and takes in that. But I think we probably differentially performed last quarter as an example on a very strong quarter in the year. So I think a little bit stronger adoption's been going up and we're benefiting from that for sure.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Yes. One -- just a quick one. I know you had presented in SEMICON a while ago that process control could go as high as 17% or something like that. Do you think that at some point of time this year that you would probably see that kind of intensity?
Richard P. Wallace: It varies. I think customers go through their own cycles and it very much depends. 17% seems much higher than what we've modeled. One way we think about it is 14% at 30 billion WFE, somewhere in that. That's a $3.2 billion business for us, and that's kind of how we look at it. And if we look back, 2011 was about that 2012 probably in that range as well.
Operator: And now our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A question on the customer capacity purchases versus technology upgrades. Do you get the sense that customers' dollars spent per wafer start on process control between capacity addition, technology upgrades are kind of similar for KLA? Because in other segments of WFE, we're seeing a bigger delta between dollars spent on capacity additions versus technology upgrades.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, where capacity -- you're saying capacity spends end up being a predominant component?
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Right.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, No, I mean for us, it is definitely true that we perform well in a technology environment and will get it -- people are always moving forward on technology and so our business often holds up. I would say what's changing now is some of the metrology businesses in particular end up being more linked to ramping. But I also think that we differentially perform relative to other capacity right now because just there's so much to control. And so the measurement and control requirements are increasing. And I'd say if you thought about our business generally, metrology would be a little bit more linked to capacity and inspection a little bit more linked to technology. And then if we're in the wafer business when we do support, the wafer manufacturers, that's really tied to both but that would be predominantly capacity related, which by the way, is not very hot. So we had a great quarter without a strong wafer market.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then just another follow-up question on the strong foundry orders. Are you thinking that the foundry spend could be sustainable into the second half if foundries try to perhaps position themselves for new design wins later in the year? Or do you think foundry has a typical digestion period at some point this year?
Richard P. Wallace: I think it's logical to assume that these things ebb and flow. And so if I integrate it over the year, I'd say foundry is very strong in the December quarter, but again, stronger than what we originally modeled, and we're looking at it very strong now. But when I talked to them, they're talking about sustained ramps to meet the needs that their customers have. And what is surprising is how well how many of them are doing. This is not a one customer phenomenon. And I think it's kind of fascinating to watch what's going on in terms of all the different devices. There's a high-end tablet and there's a low-end tablet, and the low-end tablets driving a lot of fair amount of CapEx, too. And it's kind of fascinating to watch because it's very broad right now. So I'd say the momentum is pretty strong and I think a lot depends on the success they have as they try to ramp these new yields.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I have a question for Mark. As you see more metrology come into your revenue mix, I believe those that at lower margin strides or should I assume that you're incremental growth margin will still stay in your model range of 50% to 60%?
Mark P. Dentinger: I think you can assume the latter, Krish. But I wouldn't necessarily assume the former.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. All right. And then just one other question for Rick, I don't know if someone else asked this. On the customer concentration on the foundry orders, are you seeing any Tier 2 foundry start placing orders for like 40 and below nanometer?
Richard P. Wallace: They're all Tier 1 to us, Krish. We see multiple foundries placing orders.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna Financial.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Rick, going back to your comment about foundry logic is strong. How should I think about this if WFE spending is going to be flat to down 10%, would process diagnostic be kind of flattish? I'm just trying to get a sense how the process diagnostic intensity -- spending intensity is going to compare to overall WFE?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. The way we modeled -- that is we take a very simple of view of 14% is what we're modeling now. Last quarter, I'd say it was certainly stronger than that. But being conservative, we look across the year, we'd say 14%, and that gets 2010 -- 2011 to look a lot like 2012 or 2012 look like 2011. Is there upside for that? There are definitely could be upside based on the early returns at the beginning of -- what we're seeing, there's certainly some momentum, but that's not how we're modeling it yet.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Sure. And then you did talk about diversity of the customers that was behind near doubling in the gross booking. But in terms of the number of customers, almost the doubling in the sequential basis, is that driven by like, 5 customers, 10 customers, 15, 20? Any way you can help us understand the breadth of the customers coming back?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, it's -- there's still a limited number of guys that are 28 and 40 to 28 is really the sweet spot for our markets, so you kind of know who those players are. What's interesting is the intensity ramping out of some of the ones that haven't been investing necessarily in new technology. And that's why we're saying it is pretty broad right now relative to a fairly concentrated market that we have in this space. But of course, that makes our selling very efficient, it makes service very efficient. So for our standpoint, we're fine with that. But it is not -- there are no true new entrants into it. As you know, there's one large bank in Korea that's made a big investment in getting into foundry logic and been increasing that. But other than that, it's partially similar players but focusing on new technology.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So it does make the forecasting more challenging, correct?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, long-term forecasting is pretty easy, short term is not possible. And so, when we look at it, we think, as I said, flat to down 10 for 2012, I think is not a crazy number to model. And right now, I think K-T does as well in 2012 as we did in 2011, maybe better in terms of overall revenue.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Just quickly on new bookings and the growing backlog. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand, how much of the current backlog and the new orders you expect to book in Q1 are shippable in the first half? And how much of that do you think will flow into the second half?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. The typical cycle between the time we take the order and to when we ship can range anywhere from 3 months to 9 months. It depends on the product. But we think about it in the 4.5-month range on average in general. So that's sort of a loose proxy on how to think about that, West. And then there's another 90-day cycle after that, that usually results in the final acceptance of revenue recognition.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, good. And then just a quick clarification on shipment guidance. I wrote $800 million, $850 million, was it $850 million or $860 million that you said?
Richard P. Wallace: $860 million, 8-6-0.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Can you just, I guess, give me a little bit of color in terms of what the high demand that you're seeing near-term and the ramp in terms of getting the tools to your customers? How are you keeping OpEx levels flat as you mentioned for the March quarter? What are the levers -- given that you also mentioned you're increasing hiring and so forth. What are the levers there that are keeping OpEx levels flat?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. There's a couple of things in place. First of all, we're increasing hiring, but our hiring still is at a very relatively low ramp rate, approximately the same level of hiring increase that you saw in the prior quarter which is in the 1% range. And it takes a while for those people to get on board and to get up to speed. We don't feel the full expense of that instantaneously at the beginning of the quarter. But the other phenomenon is, is that the big contributor to our spending, particularly research and development, is the amount of new material we move in. And we have some visibility on that because that has to be scheduled considerably in advance with suppliers and so on and so forth. So quarter-to-quarter, if the $200 million to $210 million level, if things can go up or down and throw you up $5 million in either direction, so I don't want to imply more science than really exists on this. We just simply roll out the divisions in terms of their planned spending in the quarter. They're usually fairly thorough on how they forecast it. But as you know, it's an educated guess at this point. I would just say that flatfish is a good planning assumption. But could it be up or down a little bit from there? Absolutely.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: I know. Fair enough. Maybe a bigger picture in terms of the metrology, some of the questions you've taken today, the pickup that you're seeing and I'm going to assume it's a little bit of both or maybe a little more color on it, it's probably a little bit of both of market demand increase, as well as potential share opportunities. Rick, maybe if you could give a little color, how that mix is working in KLA's favor on both of those ends?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure. Well, what has happened I think is on advanced [indiscernible] -- just to give you a very specific example, people doing more inspection. For example, in a registration tool where you're measuring overlay, they're measuring more spots on a wafer and they're measuring more wafers in a lot and they're doing that because they need better control. And that's a market where KLA is very strong. And as a result, we see demand going up and we benefit from that. In other ones like OCD, optical CD control where we have a strong position, there, we've actually seen good adoption by customers and some share gain as our technologies have been differentiated from our competitors. So we're getting some of both as a result but there's definitely demand increase. And to your point, we've also benefited from some share movement. But really, you have to go product by product.
Weston Twigg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And a final question for me in terms of NAND and the 3D device stacking and the TSV move that's going on, on the NAND side of things. I'm sure that you're working with the customers on both inspection and metrology. I guess bigger picture, where do you see the potential bigger opportunity, maybe now or just otherwise, but in terms of the tool adoptions on a volume basis?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, most of the business we see in NAND is not in the TSV and the back end. It's in the wafer manufacturing itself. And it has to do with the design rules plus the vertical nature of the devices, so the requirements on registration and metrology for measuring 3D devices. But we also have inspection capability that's being leveraged as those designs will shrink and people are much more sensitive to defects that they, in the past, perhaps weren't sensitive to or they just didn't know they could find. So not so much back end, definitely for us, WFE and pretty strong demand. And I think the -- it's pretty split. We definitely see metrology strength there but we've got some great inspection opportunities as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: So one of your customer, Sanders, yesterday said that they plan to push out fab 5. Do you see that as potentially impacting your whole business in the first half of 2012?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, first of all, we don't talk specifically about specific customers. But certainly, the model we have for CapEx for 2012 encompasses all the input that we've got and there's some puts and takes in that. But by and large, what we see for 2012 is CapEx to be in the range of flat to down 10% and that there were no surprises in any of the recent announcements that we've seen that impact our thinking on that.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: Great, that was helpful. And then there's some chatter -- recent chatter about DRAM customer consolidating. How do you see that impacting your business? Are you worried that your customer coming together become bigger buyers may potentially negotiate on pricing?
Richard P. Wallace: I think it's actually not a bad thing for the industry to have strong players. Nothing has been finalized in any of those discussions. But in general, we're best positioned when our customers are strong and healthy and financially doing well. And so anything that leads to that is ultimately good for the industry because they can invest in R&D, they can keep developing new technologies and we can work with them closely. So that's not something that we're particularly sensitive to if it happens or if it doesn't happen.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division: If I can squeeze one more question in. You mentioned about metrology picking up this past quarter. I was wondering how do you think about the metrology versus inspection market in the coming year Do you see the metrology continue -- potentially outgrow in the inspection space?
Richard P. Wallace: No, I think it's going to be a close battle, and those divisions are kind of both shooting for demonstrating their capability. They're different drivers. I'd say that lithography space, all the challenges in litho drive a lot of what we have in metrology, whether it's registration or the OCD business or the films, business, all related to that. The defectivity is driven -- drives us pretty strongly in what we see in the wafer, and both have a strong currents of pushing them forward right now. So I think very strong business is in both of them. And we're really pleased to have the broad portfolio we do to support our customers' needs.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Rick, since you've been talking about metrology, maybe I'll ask another metrology question. If you can provide us some more details on -- among overlay versus OCD or registration, are you seeing an inflection in some of the -- one of the technologies, 28, 22-nanometer? Or it's more mostly gradual improvement or impaired -- gradual increase in the intensity?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, there's no question that there are definitely -- there have been opportunities I think for what we're seeing. A big part of what's happening is KTL's gain share in some of those segments. And so from that standpoint, I think the demand has been there, but our differentiated solutions are winning in the markets. So a big part of what we've been seeing in increase is a function of product positioning and frankly, competitors stumbling.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And so can you provide us a little bit color on -- is that more on the foundry side or NAND side or logic side of your market share gains of the requirements?
Richard P. Wallace: So we don't break it out, as I said, there are demands in both. Certainly, foundries have pushed very hard on demands on metrology as have the memory guys. But most of our business last quarter was around logic and foundries and that's where we saw the strength in metrology as that was a bigger part of our business. Memory was only 16% of our business overall last quarter. So the fact metrology was a record implies very strong logic performance and long -- very strong foundry performance.
Operator: And we have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters.
Richard P. Wallace: Thank you, Sean. And thank you, all, for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking you -- with you throughout the quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon, my name is Steve, I'll be your conference operator for today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference call. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Ed Lockwood, KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to the KLA-Tencor's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2011. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand, following its completion, on the Investor Relations section of our website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K, for the year ended June 30, 2011, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2011 Form 10-K, and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace: Thank you, Ed, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter fiscal year 2012 earnings call. September quarter results, show KLA-Tencor, executing well in a difficult industry environment. Capitalizing on our market leadership and strong business model, to deliver solid operating performance and return significant cash to our shareholders. Revenue was $796 million in Q1, just above the midpoint of guidance, and non-GAAP net income per share was right at the midpoint of guidance of $1.17.  We generated $219 million in operating cash flow in the quarter, paid our quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, reflecting the increase in our dividend level announced in July, and repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock, ending the quarter with a healthy $2.1 billion in cash and securities.  Looking at the September demand environment, persistent economic weakness, compounded the normal cyclical factors facing our industry. Leading customers to scale back or delay capacity expansion plans. Spending was concentrated among the market leaders, and focused primarily, on supporting technology development at the leading edge. New orders for KLA-Tencor in Q1 were $486 million, down 43% sequentially.  This result was in line with our revised outlook we gave on September 8, and reflects the general demand climate I just outlined. Although overall order levels were low in Q1, as expected, the end market story is highlighted by relative strength from the foundries in the quarter. Foundry bookings were 57% in new orders in Q1, and we are expecting growth from the foundries to continue in Q2, with demand coming from selected market leaders, investing to ramp their 28-nanometer designs, to enable advanced technology development at the next nodes. Bookings from logic customers were 22% of the total in September quarter, and memory orders were low at 21% of the total.  Setting aside the macroeconomic and cyclical factors currently impacting the industry, we look ahead to 2012, with a good deal of optimism, as the forces that propel KLA-Tencor's growth and market leadership remains solid. Though overall equipment demand is experiencing a cyclical pause, technology investment remains a priority for the market leaders, as they execute their competitive strategies at the leading edge. This technology focus is favorable for KLA-Tencor, as process controls plays a critical role in helping IC manufacturers address the increasingly more complex yield challenges associated with qualifying new technologies, and this is driving higher adoption in our core markets.  Given KLA-Tencor's market leadership, strong new product acceptance, and industry-leading business model, we think the stage is set for the company to outperform in 2012.  Now turning to the guidance for the December quarter. We exited Q1 with new orders picking up in the final days of the quarter. We expect this momentum will continue in Q2, highlighted by strength from the Tier 1 foundries and growing adoption of our latest generation Brightfield technology and leading-edge memory.  December bookings are expected to be up 35%, plus or minus 10%, compared with September. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be between $600 million and $650 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $0.56 per share to $0.72 per share. With $1.1 billion in backlog as of September 30, and our anticipated order growth in Q2, we expect revenue growth to resume in the first quarter of calendar 2012. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?
Mark P. Dentinger: Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. As most of you know, we present our income statement in 2 formats. One under U.S. GAAP, and the other in the non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Restructuring-related charges and credits and any cost or credits, which are outside of our core operations, including unusual tax items. There was a $0.04 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks are on GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website.  Q1 new orders were $486 million and net orders were $481 million. Both order figures were down about 43% from last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 32% in the June quarter; Europe was 7% of new systems orders, down from 8% in Q4; Japan was 8%, down from 22% last quarter, up from 13% last quarter; and [ph] was 22%, up from 21% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 9% up from 4% in Q4.  The distribution in new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection is 28%, compared with 42% last quarter; reticle inspection was 18%, up from 17% last quarter; metrology was 14%, down from 18% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 9%, up from 6% last quarter; and service was 31% of new orders in Q1, up from 17% last quarter.  Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution in new orders by product and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: 57% of new systems orders in Q1 were from foundry customers, up from 43% in Q4; logic customers were 22% of new orders in Q1, versus 27% in Q4; and memory orders were 21% in Q1, down from 30% last quarter.  Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q2 will be up by 35%, plus or minus 10% from Q1 new orders or a range of about $605 million to $705 million. In Q1, we shipped $690 million versus $892 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments between $650 million and $700 million in Q2.  Total backlog at the end of Q1 decreased by $316 million from June 30, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in systems backlog. The backlog at September 30, 2011, included $275 million of revenue backlog, of products that have been shipped and invoiced, but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and about $780 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped.  Total revenue for Q1 was $796 million, down 11% from $892 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q1 was down 13% to $650 million, and services revenue was $146 million, down about $3 million [indiscernible]. Our expectation for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $600 million and $650 million.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in the September quarter, down from 60.7% in June. About half of the quarter-to-quarter decline in margin percentage, was attributable to higher excess inventory reserves and excess capacity, and a portion related to the lower revenue volume. For Q2, we are expecting gross margins between 57% and 58%.  Operating expenses were $198 million in Q1, compared with $184 billion in Q4, which was benefited by a $10 million payment from expansion [ph] following their bankruptcy in 2009. Research and development expenses were $105 million in Q1, and selling, general and administrative expenses were $93 million. We expect operating expenses to be about $200 million to $205 million in Q2.  OIE was a net $7 million expense in Q1, down about $3 million from Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q2.  In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $59 million or 23% of pre-tax income versus a 26% rate in Q4. The Q1 tax expense percentage was lower than in Q4, in part due to a favorable resolution of a U.S. federal tax audit during Q1. Non-GAAP net income was $198 million or $1.17 per share in Q4, down from $1.50 last quarter. If we apply our modeled tax rate of 26%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings would've been $1.12 per share. At the revenue range I had previously mentioned, and using a tax rate of 26%, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.72 per share.  Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were $169.8 million, versus $170.9 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $67 million repurchasing about $1.8 million shares, and as of September 30, 2011, we had approximately 7.3 million shares available, our current repurchase authorization. We also paid. $58 million in dividends during Q1. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share in Q2. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of $169 million for Q2.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, up about $62 million from the end of June. Cash generated from operations was $219 million in Q1, compared with $290 million in Q4. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter with $62 million, down from $583 million at the end of June. DSOs were 53 days at September 30 versus 59 days at June. Both DSO figures, are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories increased by $37 million from June 30 and ended the quarter at $613 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.2 turns in Q1, versus 2.5 turns in Q4. Capital expenditures were $12 million in Q1, down $3 million from Q4.  Total headcount at September 30, was 5,047, up from 5,492 at June 30. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2.  In summary, our guidance for Q2 is, new orders up between 25% and 45% from Q1, total revenue between $600 million and $650 million, and non-GAAP earnings between $0.56 and $0.72 per share, with a tax rate of 26%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and we'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Thanks, Mark. We'll now be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] With that operator, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Rick, I guess like sometimes, I read the press nowadays, feel like the world is ending, but I guess you guys are guiding orders up strongly. And so are some of your peers. I was wondering if you could put some -- add some more perspective on how the order rates are increasing as much as they are, given utilization that appears to be somewhat lower. Specifically, I'm talking about foundry segment. Is there any concentrated orders that are happening that may not persist beyond the December quarter or I was wondering if we can add some perspective?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, Satya. Yes, definitely world not ending, not this quarter. And we see the strong demand, primarily focused on -- I'd say 28 nanometers would be the slogan. It's all about 28 nanometer yield. And the investment going on for that. Obviously, people are -- there's demand for it, and there's challenges with yield. I think in the last couple of quarters, some of our products -- it's become apparent to our customers the value of those products, and so we have some situations where we've got products now that we don't have slots out through June. And so we're scrambling to get capacity and some of our leading edge technology-enabling products we're seeing that from multiple foundries. So right now, it looks very good.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Do you -- to what extent are the yield issues that 28-nanometer for Logic manufacturing mitigated at the moment? And do you see customers ordering inspection equipment for multiple technology nodes? One of your customers talked about going all the way to 14-nanometer. Do you see more than the normal number of nodes being ordered? Perhaps you might be able to quantify how much of your orders are 22 nanometer and below, if you have a sense of that, it would be good.
Richard P. Wallace: Well, it's always true that they want to extend the technology out. So anybody that orders a new tool today, will expect their performance to give them some insight and capability, as they extend. And certainly, for 22 and 20. But since the manufacturing ramp right now is happening in 28, and as people see the latest technology, that's really where the main application is. But I would say, a year ago, we had people buying our technology that we have available then, trying to do 28. What's happened is, they realized that there are critical defect types and measurements they can't make with the -- or can't make as well. And so they're always buying out, but they don't often realize the value of the new tool until they get a comparison. And so often, we're competing with our own generation -- prior generation, and we have to show the differentiation which is happening now. But they want insight into their R&D stuff as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Rick, in terms of your December bookings, can you help us figure out the kind of breakdown. I understand it's driven by foundries, can you give some more granularity? And also, are you seeing any kind of tick up in capacity-related purchases, given your long lead times? Or do you think it's also technology-related?
Richard P. Wallace: Right, Krish, not much in terms of capacity, more technology-oriented. What we're modeling right now is foundry, very strong in the December quarter, in the 75% range for the order book, and logic dropping back down to 9% and then the remainder of the semiconductor is about 16% for memories, and most of that NAND. So very strong in foundry and multiple geographies for foundries. So it's not one location. In fact, when we look at the geographies, just to give you a sense of that, U.S, 24% is what we see; Europe, 17%; Taiwan, 28%; Korea, 13%. So it's really spread across, spread across from a geography perspective, but much more focused on foundry.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So along these lines, I mean, that will probably put your December orders from foundries close to $500 million, but just kind of what you had like in Q1 of this year, calendar Q1 of this year? And was the concentration in Q1, much different from what you're seeing in December? In other words, was it mostly one guy ordering in Q1 versus in Q4?
Richard P. Wallace: You're talking calendar Q1?
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, I'm sorry. Calendar, yes.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. If I go back to calendar Q1, more concentrated I believe, in calendar Q1. And so it's broadened a bit. I don't have that data readily available, but just given the composition I know that we have out there now, it's literally, all the guys that are playing in advance nodes are active right now.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And then a follow-up for Mark. I noticed your R&D ticked up quite a bit. I understand there's some investment going on in EUV. Looking that fact that you'd probably be investing in 450 down the road, is this a new normal run rate for R&D? Or do you think it's going to scale back down sometime in calendar 2012?
Mark P. Dentinger: I think it's likely to stick around. The levels you're seeing right now maybe even tick up slightly as we go through this year. We'll have to see how the headcount comes through. And R&D is at least partially a function of the timing in materials purchases, and where we are in the R&D cycle. But if it is right now, we're looking at the rest of our fiscal year anyways, with the R&D number, probably north of $100 million per quarter. Not rapid ramp-up from there, but for a while, we're planning to be here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
Viswanath Valluri - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Vis Valluri for Atif. Based on your strong foundry outlook, do you think that rate, at which, foundries are ordering all these technology buys, is this ramp kind of steeper ramp, when the transition took place within 65 to 45 or 45 to 32?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, no question, it's steeper. And I think there's a couple of factors associated with that. One is it's really -- the foundries tend to be pushing more leading edge, than they were. At that time, they weren't leading as much, and technology as they're now, and that's driven by their customer needs. If you look back in time too, there wasn't the -- back then, just take one company like a TI, had their own fab capability. And now, they might be ordering and they don't. So the fabless community has increased. And there's more intensity for advanced designs. The other thing we're seeing, there are actually more design starts at this point in the cycle at 28 nanometer, than they were, even at 45. So there's definitely a lot of customer interest in that capability.
Viswanath Valluri - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: The second question I have is, I know there's a lot of activity in 3D packaging TSV areas. I just want to get your thoughts on the opportunity for KLA's defect inspection on these.
Richard P. Wallace: We're already very active in packaging, and we have capability via the ICOS product line that we have. So we believe we're in the sweet spot of the opportunities in packaging. TSV is an interesting technology. It has some capability. We are constantly monitoring and investigating that, but we don't have a meaningful play, nor do we see the longevity of that market in terms of an opportunity yet. So we certainly have to take technology to enter it, but we're not there now. And we continue to monitor it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Mark Delaney, calling in for Jim. Rick, I was hoping you could help us understand a little bit more in the 28-nanometer foundry driver. Roughly, $275 million of foundry orders this quarter, sounds like your guiding to about $500 million for next quarter, very high relative to historical levels. I was just wondering if you can help us put that in perspective, in terms of maybe what inning you think that is, with respect to the 28-nanometer ramp?
Richard P. Wallace: Right. Boy, great question. We were surprised, as I mentioned earlier, in the market interest in some of our advanced technologies, most specifically, wafer inspection seems a real strong demand. But also, some of that is new penetration, so we've had a real nice e-Beam review business that's picked up and gained some real good share, and that's partly contributing to it, as we're seeing more market share than we pick some of that up. And as I said, e-Beam review. And that's based on the capability we have to review the defects that our advance inspectors find, the unique capability. So part of it is adoption of advanced technologies, part of it is share, and part of it, frankly, is there are more foundry players struggling with their yield issues at 28. And I think it's still relatively early in that, and so we modeled the rest of -- as we look out the next several quarters, we think that the bookings, the bottom for bookings was September quarter, and through our fiscal year, we can see continued strength based on the challenges people are having, not just in the foundries, but also some of the things we think are coming along in memory, too. So relatively early mid in the 28-nanometer challenge and that will be followed by 22.
Mark Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then as a follow-up question, it sounds like you guys expect your logic business to be down in terms of orders, pretty significantly next quarter. I was wondering, when you think about your logic business, what are your expectations for new capacity adds throughout 2012, and maybe drive that higher, or do you think that's more of a run rate level?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, no, the 9% is light. And I think a lot of that was -- there were some new logic capacity that had been in everybody's plans and came out. And I think that's a big part of that. But 9% would be low on a sustained basis. There was a time where logic was 1/3, we were 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. And obviously, we're not there now, but I would expect that it would, over time, pick back up. It's pretty lumpy as it is, especially to some of our advanced technologies. Some of our more expensive tools are pretty lumpy in terms of how they go. So I'd say that's a low number over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Srini Sundararajan from Oppenheimer.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I just have a simple question. What's your prognosis on 2012 in terms of WFE? And if you cannot provide that, perhaps for the first half of 2012?
Richard P. Wallace: Srini, it's a simple question, but it's tough, tough one to answer. The way we're looking at 2012 right now, it's funny I back up, and I think how we saw the world back in July. And then I say, we went through an air pocket, and it's looking more like it did back in July, than it did in frankly, August and part of September. And things looked a bit more robust. So I think overall, if I look out to 2012, I think CapEx, barring any macro events, which I think we're -- that's not a certainty, but barring that, the normal industry cycle, I think we'd expect to see the overall industry in the down 10% kind of range for 2012, off of what we think will be a strong finish to 2011. And so for K-T in the first half, as we model it, as we said in the prepared remarks, that we think our revenue bottoms in the December quarter, and we expect, based on how we're seeing the world, that things pick up from here.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I have just one follow-up. In terms of 450 millimeters, what are your plans right now?
Richard P. Wallace: Our plans are to support the transition, which I think will happen at some point. But I don't think there'll be any meaningful production for quite some time, largely just based on the availability of the broad-based tool set. But we're already selling tools, some of our advanced wafer, their wafer inspection tools are going to some OEMs. But based on the flow of that, we think its several years before they'll be pilot capability out of the market. But all of the tools that we're in development now, have plans to be able to support the 450 transition when it happens. But I don't think it's going to be a meaningful part of our revenue for several years.
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Just one short follow-up. On the EUV, the gross EUV has been delayed. How much more is trending do you expect to happen, in terms of what it means to KLA?
Richard P. Wallace: For us to support EUV?
Srinivasan Sundararajan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: No, no, just because of the fact that EUV has been delayed, so therefore, there will be more number of metrology and inspection steps, that have got to go through your tools.
Richard P. Wallace: Oh, okay, I see. Yes, it's funny, it's almost -- we're almost agnostic about it because there is opportunity -- there eventually will be opportunity, reticle inspection to support EUV transition. But in lieu of that, there's opportunity in metrology to support the multiple patterning, double patterning and maybe even beyond that. And so when we look at it, in the end, it's almost -- it's a wash in terms of where we're going. We will have investment for EUV. We also, right now, can bridge the early nodes with our reticle inspection tool, with the 600 series. So we actually have some capability for that now. So I think there's some support in terms of [indiscernible] some of our business, but it's similar to what we've been modeling.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Two questions, Rick. For the first question is, given that your visibility is there until June of next year, how would you, say, characterize by the segment in terms of wafer inspection metrology, as well as reticle inspection going forward for the next 2 to 3 quarters, because your wafer inspection has pretty much dropped about 70% from the peak.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, so we see December is getting back, we think wafer gets back to the 40% kind of range and metrology back to about 18% and reticle closer to 15%, and service becomes a smaller percentage of the total, at 20%, and our other businesses probably run around it. At 7%, so not that different from historical. We did have a September, as I said, an air pocket, but at the end of the quarter, what we saw was pretty strong interest, and that's part of the strength we see this quarter in the wafer inspection, particularly, in the Brightfield. So I think we get back closer to kind of the historical run rate. And reticle can be lumpy, as you know, depending on relatively low volume, high dollar tools. And as we continue to grow, if we continue to go up from here, service gets smaller as a percent.
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: The second question is, I see the quote on 2012. How do you see the foundries war playing out, in terms of spending, amongst the 3 players, 3 media players?
Richard P. Wallace: I think they're more, more positive on -- what's that?
Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Just one thing. Is it going to be one dominant player spending or is it going to be all the 3 of them spending to get a share of the market?
Richard P. Wallace: Well it's the great thing about this business, if you asked me that 5 weeks ago, I would have had a different answer than I have today. Based on just information, as recently in the last couple of days, I'd say, it's pretty broad-based at this point, driven by -- in particular, I think some advancements people are making in getting their technologies to work, but not fully yield. And also, broader customer participation and interest in the foundries. So ratcheting up investment, because they believe they can make a strategic move. And so as a result, we see players, multiple players, investing to continue to support the business, but also, in a hope to gain share.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Question on the composition of the December order. Can you give us some sense of how by product the distribution is, and particularly interested in -- you talked about that you have some products which have lead times, which you can't get slot for all the way through June. So is the product distribution going to be similar or different in the December quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, different. I mean, I just went through that, but the wafer looks like it's going up to 40% range, which is similar to, much more similar to what was in June and December. Metrology, 18%, which is actually what it was back in June, and up from September. Reticle, 15% and service at 20%, and other high disk drive and other at 7%. So looking more like our historical kind of numbers.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: So the long lead time new tool you talked about, is that the Brightfield inspection tools?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just one question on gross margin. I missed -- you said half of the gross margin last quarter, the miss was because of absorption of fixed costs. And what was the other half?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, the other half of it was increase in research and -- increase in what we call excess in low demand parts. And when you get a steep inflection in the demand curve, because we came off of a very high booking quarter in Q4, and then you go into a lower booking quarter in Q1, the way our excess model works, is that, that drives a pretty significant, at least, temporary increase in the excess calculation, which results in a P&L hit across the revenue line.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Is that something you can bring back if the demand improves?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes. Historically, we have brought most of it back. Historically, our scrappage rates are much lower than the absolute dollar that we post for excess in load demand parts. But the truth is, is that because it's a guess, we try to stay conservative with that, and when we do see a demand pull back, we do set up reserves pretty quickly against that. And vice versa, if we see an intermediate to longer-term demand uptick again, I've talked in prior calls, about the fact that, that results in actually, reductions in those reserves, which come back to us in terms of favorable cost of revenue.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And so will that be something close to 700, 750 run rate, I would think in terms of revenues.
Richard P. Wallace: When you say 700 to 750, you're speaking what?
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: What I'm saying that the write down you took for 100 basis point of gross margin, will you be able to bring that back when the revenue levels go to 750 level?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, it's probably more correlated when the bookings levels return, and again, it's a 4-quarters look forward and our best guess at bookings levels. But yes, if you saw a couple of quarters a strong bookings activity return and we were -- you heard optimism on the call in terms of our forecast, that would in turn, trigger reversal of that and it would probably come back -- I don't know how much of it would come back, a full point maybe, maybe 3 quarters of a point, something would likely to come back.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: One last question on the backlog. In the last cycle, in the 2008 cycle, when the world was falling apart completely, your backlog bottomed at 500. What would be your estimate, if the revenues bottom around 600 -- current level around 600, what will the backlog bottom?
Mark P. Dentinger: It's hard to tell, it's a function of -- Rick alluded to earlier, when we're getting new orders for -- that have long lead time parts and long lead time supply lines, you can carry backlog even for stuff that's in current demand up to 6 months. When you get a sustained period of a downturn, obviously, you drain the backlog pretty significantly over that period of time. But what we're moving through right now, is obviously a pretty choppy period of a significant up -- with a significant down this quarter, where we're looking for a significant up next quarter. So it's a little hard to tell exactly how the backlog will react, but it is not absolutely given, that it will react a particular way, in response to a change in the demand forecast.
Richard P. Wallace: I think the other way to look at it is the December quarter, we're normally looking at it one-to-ones. So not consuming any backlog and not really building any, which is interesting, given where you think we are in the cycle.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's what's very interesting. Usually you -- in a downturn, you go through the backlog. And this time, it looks like it remains stable. And that's the reason I was trying to figure out, where does it -- this time, where does it bottom? Will it bottom like at these levels?
Mark P. Dentinger: Yes, again, it depends on how long it lasts. But we did chew up $300 million this quarter, backlog.
Richard P. Wallace: I think the takeaway is, we're pretty conservative on this, we got a pretty good cushion. And if things play out the way our current view is, then as you go forward, we've got a lot more power, firepower in it. I think the other way to think about it is, we had a really good cushion because of all the uncertainty, and as uncertainty comes out, then it gives you more ability. But we're pretty happy with the way it's playing right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Two follow-ups. Rick, going back to opportunities in sub 30-nanometer amongst foundries, do you attribute this to difference of technologies, Taiwan versus non-Taiwanese foundries? Or is that just purely a shrink related yield challenge, or shrink related, that shrink that causes the yield issues?
Richard P. Wallace: More related to shrink, everything that comes with doing sub-30-nanometer less, based on any particular implementation of sub-30 technology, geographic-based or otherwise. And in both, we're seeing it both in the wafer inspection side of the world, but also, in the metrology side of the world. The other thing is I think, we have a very strong share position. So that's helping us as well.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And is that what the customers are telling you or is that about your service or field people are feeding back to you?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, we have 500 applications engineers that work closely with our customers, we've got a whole process control solutions group, and we have a lot of customer in action. I'd say, we have quite a bit of intimacy. But with our customers, and so we have our own assessment, as well as what we're hearing from their technologists. But recognize we're in the fabs everyday, we're in R&D every day, with them, creating our solutions and supporting them. So we have -- I think pretty good insight. It's not so much what they say in the conference room but what we see in the fabs and in the engineering part of the world.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: And one follow up question. Your commentary on overall doubling your fee for next year down 10%. Given how strongly you're finishing the year in terms of bookings, are you concerned that this strengthening in booking may not last beyond March quarter? Or in other words, what gives you the confidence that this could have more leg into it?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, I think its back to the -- there's really one part of the customer base that's spending. We're starting to see signs of life out of other segments like the bare wafer guys, who have been holding back. We've got memory has been turned off, I think DRAM hasn't been spending much at all, and there's more interest in NAND going forward. So I think that largely, the strength is based on limited capacity adds, mostly technology adds. So I think there's a lot of opportunities out there, providing the overall macro situation, doesn't deteriorate. And I think Today, the worlds all breathing a sigh of relief on the macro, and we'll see how long that lasts.
Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: In other words, the down 10% for WFE next year, could easily be rewards up if your customers gain confidence, correct?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, one thing we know for sure is that the forecast people give, are adjusted all the time. And I've been talking recently with some of our key customers, who as recently in the last week, are thinking about adjusting their CapEx upward for 2012.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Heller with CLSA.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Just a maintenance question. What is the split between DRAM and NAND within the bookings for the quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: It's splitting in a really small number. I think the NAND as a percent of memory, last quarter, was 17%. So that makes it 4% of total, so pretty small. Going forward, however, the December quarter that snaps back and we see it being 69% of memory, which is 11% of the total. So up, but not at historic levels.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: Okay. And I didn't quite catch the breakout for Korea during the quarter. And can you also talk about the outlook for order activity coming out of Korea in December? And maybe the first part of next year?
Richard P. Wallace: Sure, Korea was 29% of the September quarter, and December, we're forecasting it to come off of that at about 13%. And as far as next year, I think a couple of factors. Obviously, Korea is made up of several customers, but one major one who's committed recently publicly to continuing the investment throughout 2012, which is great. And the other one has been largely not investing as they go through some transition, and I think if they get through that transition, we would expect there to be spending there as well, as well as some of the other businesses that we have in Korea. So Korea should shape up to be strong for KLA-Tencor in 2012.
Mark Heller - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division: And one last question if I can? Can you just talk about maybe how you see your opportunities maybe growing in the NAND market?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, in NAND -- NAND is -- you got to invest. And right now, NAND has been pretty soft in general. What we have seen and what we're encouraged by, as some of the limited activity we had was to get some of our latest technology in wafer inspection into the NAND customers, where they find they are not seeing some of the defects they thought they were seeing. And I think once capacity investment resumes, we'll be in a position to take advantage of that as we support our customers bringing up their new technology. So that's when certainly, we have opportunity in metrology, we tend to do pretty well in NAND, in metrology and in their film thickness business, we also made some progress in our optical CD, which is replacing CD SEM for some of the critical measurements. And all of those bode well for the future, but those are more capacity-related and technology-related, in terms of getting any kind of material impact to our overall business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Citigroup.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: This Wenge Yang for Tim. A couple of things, you mentioned about WFE took down 10% next year, and also, you have some visibility all the way to June quarters in terms of bookings. So with those informations at hand, what do you think about the linearities next year? Is it going to be front-end loaded like 2011? Or do you think its more tilt towards the back end?
Richard P. Wallace: Well, actually to clarify, I don't know that we have visibility into 2012. We have our internal models, that's how we think, things are going to look. And that's their model, since right now, we model 2012 to be down 10. We do see strength, customers a lot of, I think, encouraging signs out of customers as they look forward to 2012. Some have publicly gone in and said they're going to either maintain or increase CapEx. Others have said they're going to come off 10% to 20%. So we add up what they say, it looks pretty good. We do see strength as we indicated by our guide for December, and from there, we can spot many projects that are going on. But we don't -- we're not guiding past December, but we do see encouraging signs. This is truly the bottom in terms of bookings in September, then of course, you'd see a resumption of an increasing trend. Although it can increase for awhile, and still not get back to the peaks of the prior cycle that we just went through. So we are coming off a relatively low base in September.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. So given through when we talked to several of your customers, they actually mention about the yield challenge for seeing smaller and complex defects, which made them want to have, looking into a new -- some of the new defect inspection tools. Could you comment on your offering to address those issues? And any new product pipelines that could change the -- meet the demands on your customers on those leading-edge nodes?
Richard P. Wallace: Right. Yes, we're hearing very much the same thing and we have a lot of conversations about that when we meet with customers. And I'll just give -- I'll highlight 3 products that I think are supporting our customers' intent to find and fix those defects. Brightfield product line is very strong. As I mentioned, a lot of interest in that, and we're seeing a strong adoption, and we feel very fortunate about our position there and think that'll continue to grow. The same is true for our narrowband tool, our Darkfield tool. We're seeing a lot of adoption, particularly, when we think about some of the opportunities we have in memory, that product is strong. And then the other product that complements those tools, our e-Beam review, where we're seeing a continued gain in market share, because we've got the only review tool in the market that's capable of reviewing the defects that our advanced inspectors find in a fast and efficient manner, and it makes everything more valuable, it makes our Brightfield, and Darkfield more valuable for our customers. Even our bare wafer benefits from it. And our customers find that with that insight as to what their problems are, they have a better shot at fixing them. So I think all those products should continue to be strong, and we're seeing very much the same thing from our customers that you're hearing from them. They need to find and fix these critical defects, is the only way they can ramp these advanced technology nodes.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. Just following along that line. The other comment is that some of those new solutions are much more complex. And also, much more expensive. So from your point of view, some of your new products, how do they impact on your margin structure moving forward?
Richard P. Wallace: I would expect when the smart -- I would expect that our margins will stay relatively consistent with what you've seen in the past. You're right, the price points on some of the new tools are going up but our costs go up as well. And obviously, the research and development leading to them. But we are focused on maintaining our margins, which allows us to do the next-generation of research and development for future tools. So it's pretty consistently built into the KLA-Tencor culture, and we believe, as long as our tools are setting the standard in terms of defect metrology solutions, the price point can be commended.
Wenge Yang - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, one last question. Some of your peers have taken a pretty drastic approach on the share buyback. What's your thinking on your strategy on share buyback versus dividend? And is there any change on your future outlook in terms of how to execute on those 2 fronts.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we were the first in this space to introduce dividend. We've been growing that dividend about 12%, 15% a year since we did it. We're committed to the dividend, we think it's a great way to reward shareholders over the long-term. The buyback is another strategy, but we're really focused on the dividend. We do buyback, we bought back stock last quarter, but really, I'd say our emphasis is on returning and rewarding our existing shareholders through the dividend payout, and we're going to continue to support that. And our expectation is as earnings grow over time, we'll be in a position to continue to support that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays Capital.
Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division: This is Olga calling for CJ. Just wanted to probe a little bit more on the memory side. You talked about foundry giving you a lot of visibility into the first half of the year. Just wanted to see what you're seeing within the memory space, specifically, as you mentioned, sort of semipublic comments during the week regarding the Korean players?
Richard P. Wallace: We do see hope for memory, but we didn't see much action. So it’s more talk and less action right now at this point in terms of investment. But there's a lot of interest, and we're having very constructive customer meetings about our advanced technology and capabilities. And again, I'd highlight the wafer inspection products, as well as metrology, both those overlay film thickness, and optical CD. And all those I think, have strong place in memory. So I think we're well-positioned to support memory customers as they return to investment mode. But right now, we're just like everyone, wait and see when that will happen. And we're hopeful that will start. We're not counting it on -- on it for December, but we think the signs are positive as we go forward.
Olga Levinzon - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And then on the OpEx side, clearly, there's an uptick heading into December. How should we think of -- in that down 10% environment for 2012, how should we think about your OpEx structure going forward?
Mark P. Dentinger: This is Mark. Our view right now is that if 2012 played out just as we've been describing it as a down 10% year, we would not take our foot off of the R&D pedal at all, which is the majority -- or not the vast majority, but it's the biggest piece of OpEx. That we would stay on the roadmaps, and we believe our customers would probably have a continued interest in us, advancing those roadmaps. On the G&A side, I wouldn't expect it to grow significantly during 2012 with what our view is right now. But you never know as we get closer. So I would expect that right now, we're probably sized pretty close to what we would expect to be, at least for the first half of 2012, and then we'll sort of play it by ear.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, we're pretty happy, I think when our operating margin leverage in our model. And the only way we can continue that over time is making sure we make those investments as Mark indicate, so we're going to keep doing that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Rick, just a question on the technology upgrade. With the big focus on technology upgrades going forward, did you think this is the year that KLA's share of total WFE gets back, or even exceeds that 14% level?
Richard P. Wallace: I'm sorry, that was a question or a statement?
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That was a question, do you think you'll get that back to the 14% level?
Richard P. Wallace: I was going to support your thesis. We certainly see the right signs now as we look forward and of course, we spend our time talking to our customers about the problems and how we can solve them, and not as much about what they're doing with the rest of their spend. But we look at it, and I'd say that there is a significant level of discussion about them needing and wanting our latest capability. So we feel pretty good. And as I said, when we model '12 right now, just to give you a sense, we looked at '11, and the way we shake out when you look at the midpoint of our guide for revenue, and our expectation for industry, will have been up 27%, and WFE about -- up 10%. So we think we've made -- gained some ground there. And then we think about '12 and we think the industry is probably down 15-ish, WFE down 10 to 15 and we're -- if it's down 15, we'd model it, we're down 10. So we think we'll outperform the rest of the industry in 12 as well.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then just a follow-up question on your view on CapEx in 2012, I know you said down 10%, but it sounds like you're a lot more optimistic on foundry here? Is this a year that -- is 2012 like a year you're still planning foundry, CapEx could possibly be up in 2012?
Mark P. Dentinger: Again, I wouldn't -- I'm not ready to say it yet because the people that are indicating higher or thinking about higher, aren't right now, and our model is higher, but its chatter right now, and I would say we'll know a lot more by the time we get to the call for the December quarter. And I have more customer interface with them right now. But the major foundries, I guess if I think about it, 3 of them -- 2 of them had indicated down for 2012, and 1 indicated up and then the others are smaller in terms of the total mix. I don't know that, that could change and certainly, they're more bullish today than they were a few weeks ago.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Blansett from JPMorgan.
Bill Peterson: This is Bill Peterson, calling in for Chris. A couple of questions. I guess sticking on the market share theme, it sounds like you're making headway in a lot of you segments. Should we see that in the numbers that Gartner will publish in March or due to lead times, would this be something we see in the 2012 figures?
Mark P. Dentinger: Its' hard to say whether they'll show up or not in Gartner. I know how the input works on that, and I'm not sure. We certainly know what we're hearing from customers. The other factor is that Gartner tends to be based on revenue, and we're looking -- I think, maybe upstream of that. Because we're reacting to how bookings are going. And bookings, for example, let's say you win a new technology node, and it could be a couple of tools, which are booked, and not even revenued, but you have a sense of where the revenue is going to come from after that. That wouldn't show up, and that's more what we're looking at.
Bill Peterson: Okay. Next is, maybe a little bit off, maybe towards the end of next year, maybe beyond your fiscal year, but what is vertical NAND for KLA-Tencor?
Richard P. Wallace: Means a really good technical challenges. I think specifically, the 2 areas, the 1 in particular is I -- I'm amazed with our engineers, have technologies that can measure some of those. In film thickness in particular, and optical CDs, some of the measurements we need to make there. And I think we've got pretty good approaches to that. And then there's the defect inspection, which I feel pretty good about our position there. But I -- anytime there's major process architecture change, 2 things happen. One, we have to make sure our existing technology can support that change; and the other, is our customers tend to go through integration issues, which cause yield problems which can accelerate their need for inspection measurements. So as long as we're able to capitalize it, on it, I think it creates great opportunity for us, but at the same time, until it plays out, we don't know that. But there's certainly a lot of concern and the reason they're going about is because they -- the conventional path they're on, has kind of ran out of gas beyond 2x.
Bill Peterson: Last one, I'm supposed to say a $700 million revenue run rate, how should we expect the other businesses such as solar and LED to play out? I mean there's a lot of weakness in both sectors? How do we view that looking forward?
Richard P. Wallace: It's true. In solar and LED right now, clearly, softening. I think that LED, we have an interesting play there, because we're a leader in the inspection of the epi wafers. So we've got a good position, but it's relatively small. We saw some around 10% percent of our business was non-semi, and the September quarter and even the December that drops down to 7%-ish and it was 6% back in June. So we continue to be hopeful that those businesses will grow, but right now, there's still a reasonably small part of our overall business. And I think throughout 2012, on a relative basis, we hope to see some growth. But solar has got to recover first, and that's going to be a few quarters away at least.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: I know it's early in 28 and the defect mechanisms are probably very different than they were at 40. But I'm curious, how did the yields look early on in 28, relative to 40, which I recall, had issues for folks? And then as you move to finer nodes, 20 or whatever, where you start introducing more double patterning, maybe thinset et cetera, does that become incrementally, by definition, more difficult or not?
Richard P. Wallace: Raj, yes, you have a good memory. I think there was a speed bump everybody hit, and it was interesting because they thought on 40 and 45. Actually, what happened really, is they jumped from 45 to 40, hit some integration problems and we suddenly watched as order levels with foundry shot up, as a result. Kind of the same phenomena happening in 28. I would say it depends that there's a range of spectrum of yields on 28, depending on which fab line you're in and who's managing that. And I think, it's similar in terms of the challenge, and I think once again, caught many of our customers by surprise, because they thought they had it dialed and perhaps, what they saw in prototyping, they thought would extend the manufacturing, and that's not what's happening. So it's a good opportunity for us. The great part -- the biggest part of that though, is the new technologies that were brought to market, suddenly give us something to show to customers that switched their buying philosophy from, "Boy, that's interesting." To, "I must have it, when can I get my spot? Why don't I have a slot? Why can't you give me more slots?" Which are really -- we want to help our customers, support them, but it's a challenge for us to be able to ramp up. So I think good opportunity for us at 28. And I think the world just gets harder as you go down. And the challenge for us is to make sure we've got the technology to support the advance nodes, which in fact, to Mark's point, why we're going to keep investing.
Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division: So your dollar intensity, I guess what I'm hearing, is your dollar intensity isn't likely to do anything, other than go up node to node? It's not going to bounce up and down, node to node. It seems to be the slope maybe even difficult to ascertain, but it's going to generally continue to go up, shrink to shrink to shrink?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, shrink to shrink. There's always the marketing nodes. Our customers can have a marketing node, where there's not a lot of technology involved there. They're pitching it as an advanced technology, or the next-generation, but it's really the same process flow. And then it doesn't necessarily look that way. But by and large, as long as they're making real process transitions, then we got great opportunity.
Operator: Your next -- your last question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick J. Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Bigger-picture question for you guys, in terms of the DRAM industry. Historically, it's been less process-control intensive, relative to your other customer segments. Do you see the move down to the 20 nanometer node as being kind of an inflection point where you'll see, not only both increased process control, but perhaps, for you guys, even share gains, as that market place grows.
Richard P. Wallace: I think we've got pretty good share. I think there has been the area where frankly, we've had more challenges with lower-cost competitors, as in DRAM in particular. And part of that is -- I think the challenge that we have in DRAM is that you got redundancy, and so people can -- they don't need quite as pure a process to be able to survive. But that said, I think people are really dealing with the challenges. And lithography is one area where, because of multiple patterning, some of the challenges people face on just look of constraints, we have strong business in the metrology. And I'd say defect inspection, we've got some new product offerings that we think should position us well from a competitive standpoint. But we've got work to do to demonstrate the capability to be able to drive adoption up. And clearly, DRAM market in general is not a particularly, fast-growing market. So I think frankly, NAND has more promise in terms of getting a larger percent of the CapEx, as we go forward.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back for closing remarks.
Richard P. Wallace: Thank you, Steve. Thank you all for joining us on our conference call today, and that concludes our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jessica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Fourth Quarter Fiscal '11 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Jessica. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the KLA-Tencor's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2011. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com or call (408) 875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on demand following its completion on the Investors section of our website. There, you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2010 and our subsequently filed 10-Q report. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Any information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2010 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, you can be reassured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Given that we provided a thorough business update just 2 weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the financials.  KLA-Tencor delivered record revenue earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2011, demonstrating our continued strong market leadership and successful execution of our long-term strategies for customer focus, growth and operations excellence in a period of robust industry growth. Bookings for the June quarter were $853 million, flat compared with March and at the upper end of the range of guidance. And in the fourth quarter, we experienced strong demand in each of our major end markets, looking for a record $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2011, 14% above the previous fourth quarter high that we set back in fiscal year 2007, driven by higher adoption of process control, growth in our services business and the addition of new markets. June quarter revenue grew 7% to a record $892 million, coming in at the upper end of the range of guidance. And the non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.50 in Q4, above the range of guidance for the quarter. Contributing to these results in Q4 were record operating margin of 40.1%. Today, KLA-Tencor is reporting margins significantly above our baseline model, reflecting our cost discipline and the value that we bring to our customers.  Finally, cash flow from operations was a record $290 million in Q4. And we were active in returning value to shareholders, purchasing -- repurchasing 1.4 million shares in the quarter for $58 million, and of course, paying our are regularly quarterly dividend. In fiscal year 2011, we repurchased a total of 6.2 million shares for $233 million. Also, as we announced on July 12, our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, which is scheduled to take effect beginning with our dividend to be declared next month.  This move reflects management and the board's confidence in our long-term outlook for the company, as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. So clearly, our results indicate another very strong performance for KLA-Tencor in Q4, capping a record year for the company and showcasing the strength of our market leadership and our industry-leading business model. Of course, the driving force behind our success remains the strong effort in collaboration with our customers and business partners, as well as great execution of the worldwide workforce. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank each and every employee for their contribution in helping KLA-Tencor excel in this environment and in shaping our future success.  Shifting our focus now to the current period and our view of the near-term outlook, as we reported at SEMICON West 2 weeks ago, the near-term industry demand environment has cooled off significantly of late with customers reassessing their capacity expansion plans and timelines and in light of persistent weakness in the macroeconomic environment and lackluster PC sales. However, looking past the current environment, we believe the drivers underlying long-term growth in our industry remain intact.  With economic expansion in the emerging markets, the rapid proliferation of new end products featuring high IC content and increasing complexity as the leading edge, all pointing to healthy long-term equipment demand. And we further believe that our customers remain committed to their roadmap towards shrinking device sizes and other technology advancements as a means for driving future competitive differentiation and to lower cost. This technology focus plays in the K-T strength as the market leader in process control, as we play a critical role in helping our customers address the increasingly more difficult challenges associated with improving yields and lowering costs of leading edge. In this environment, the long-term outlook for process control investment remains solid. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. For bookings, we have adjusted our internal forecast to reflect further deterioration in the market environment subsequent to SEMICON West. And we now expect September quarter bookings to be in the range of down 35% in the quarter, plus or minus 10% and bookings in the second half of 2011 to be down more than the 15% to 20% range we originally indicated. Guidance for revenue in September is in the range of $770 million to $820 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share are projected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.24 in the quarter.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?
Mark Dentinger: Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items.  There was a $0.07 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. Q4 new orders were $853 million, essentially flat with last quarter. And net orders were $847 million, down slightly from $856 million last quarter. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distributions were as follows: the U.S. was 32% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 25% in the March quarter; Europe was 8% of new systems orders, down from 16% in Q3; Japan was 22%, up from 17% last quarter; Korea was 13%, up from 9% last quarter; Taiwan was 21%, down from 23% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 4%, down from 10% in Q3.  The Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: wafer inspection was 42% compared to 48% last quarter; reticle inspection was 17%, up from 10% last quarter; metrology was 18%, down slightly from 19% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi were 6%, even with last quarter; and services was 17% of new orders in Q4, also even with the last quarter. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the distribution of new orders by market and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were: 43% of new systems orders in Q4 were for foundry customers versus 58% in Q3; logic customers were 27% of orders in Q4 versus 15% in Q3; and memory orders were 30% in Q4, up from 27% last quarter.  Looking forward, we expect that new orders for Q1 will be down by 35% plus or minus 10% from Q4 new orders, or a range of $470 million to $640 million. In Q4, we shipped $892 million versus $823 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both systems shipments and services revenue. And we expect shipments between $725 million and $750 million in Q1. Total backlog at the end of Q4 decreased slightly for March 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in systems backlog. Backlog at June 30, 2011 included $382 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and a little under $1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q4 was $892 million, up 7% from $834 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q4 was up 8% to $744 million, compared with $691 million from Q3 and services revenue was $149 million in Q4, up about $6 million from Q3. Our expectation for total revenue in Q1 is a range between $770 million and $820 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.7% in the June quarter, down from 61.3% in March. The gross margin percentage decline from last quarter was due to higher parts cost in our services business. For Q1, we are expecting gross margins of approximately 60%. Operating expenses were $184 million in Q4, with the research and development component at $99 million and selling, general and administrative expenses at $85 million. OpEx was down about $6 million from Q3 because we received a $10 million payment in Q4 from the trustee expense in Japan following their bankruptcy in our fiscal 2009.  Without this statement, OpEx would have been approximately $194 million, and our EPS would have been $0.04 lower. We expect operating expenses to increase to about $197 million in Q1. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q4, about even with Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $10 million in Q1 as well. In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax expense is $92 million or 26% of pretax income versus $87 million in Q3, which was 28% of pretax income. The Q4 tax expense percentage was lower than Q3 in part due to the release of certain tax reserves in Q4. Non-GAAP net income was $256 million or $1.50 per share in Q4, up from $1.31 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.42 per share. At the revenue range I've have previously mentioned and using a modeling rate for income taxes of 26%, we would expect our Q1 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.10 and $1.24 per share.  At this point I would like to add some commentary on our go-forward, non-GAAP tax rate. As you know, for the past several years, we have used a 30% modeling rate for non-GAAP income taxes. 30% estimate was based on analysis and forecast from several years ago. And on today's call, we are updating this rate to 26%. The new modeling rate is based upon tax planning decisions we have implemented during the last few years and our estimated income projections for the next few years, which includes assumptions about the distribution of earnings between our U.S. and international locations.  Because this rate is an amalgamation of many different rates from jurisdictions where we operate, and accounting rules for income taxes and related reserves are complex, our expectation is that the actual quarterly rate will almost never exactly match 26%. However, for purposes of issuing financial guidance moving forward, you can expect us to use the 26% rate, unless we are aware of specific factors that suggest another rate.  The weighted average share that's used to compute EPS in Q4 were $170.9 million versus $171.3 million in Q3. During Q4, we spent $58 million, repurchasing about 1.4 million shares. And as of June 30, 2011, we had approximately 9 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares, as well as paying quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share beginning in Q1. For guidance purposes, we are modeling in the same average the share count as Q4. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $2 billion, up about $200 million from the end of March. Cash generated from operations was $290 million in Q4 compared with $244 million in Q3. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $583 million, up from $566 million at the end of March. DSOs were 59 days at June 30 versus 62 days in March. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factoring. Net inventories increased by $19 million from March 31 and ended the quarter at $576 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q4, which is flat with Q3. Capital expenditures were $15 million in Q4, about the same as Q3. The total headcount at June 30 was 5,492, up from 5,386 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q1.  In summary, our guidance for Q1 is: new orders down between the 25% and 45% from Q4, total revenue between $770 million and $820 million and non-GAAP EPS between $1.10 and $1.24 assuming a tax rate of 26%. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. And then with that, operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch: This is Thomas Yeh for Krish Sankar. We've been hearing quite a bit about 28-nanometer yield issues at the foundries. How is that benefiting KLAC in the September and December quarter? Are these issues being driven by any specific material changes such as high k metal gate, or is it more broad-based?
Richard Wallace: It's Rick. Yes, there are certainly challenges associated with the new technologies, no question. And we are, as we have in the past, we're seeing that. And it does impact some of the business that we're winning in the foundries. I do think it has a long term or positive momentum for us. But short term, I think we are in a softening environment and that's part of the challenge in the industry. But there's no question, it's new materials. Just the reduced marginality and the process window associated with 28 and 20 nanometers creates opportunities for us. And also in -- and generally, and the overlay constraints are creating opportunities, too. So all those are going to be good for us as people try to roll this technology out in the broader production.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG: This is Farhan calling in for Satya. Just had a question regarding your Q4 -- regarding the calendar Q4. How does -- how do you see it right now? Can you give some color on it?
Richard Wallace: Yes, sure. We -- obviously we're not guiding for Q4, but our current view is that the September quarter is going to be pretty significantly down as we guided from bookings perspective, and we do anticipate things to improve after that. But there's just not a lot of visibility out there. So it's very hard to call it this early and especially in a market that's as dynamic as this. But we do see a lot of projects on the books. We see a lot of interest from customers. I think that, generally, if customers execute on their plans that they've communicated with us, then December should be a recovery from the September quarter.
Farhan Rizvi - Crédit Suisse AG: And can you specify a little more on like which area among the customer -- like which segment is it foundry or memory that's causing the biggest uncertainty for you?
Richard Wallace: Well, we're seeing certainly some softening in foundry in the recent past. And I -- when we have conversations with them, I think some of that is digestion of some of the capacity they brought online, some challenges they're facing and getting their processors where they want them before they ramp. So, I'd say, probably more predominately foundry than the other segments. Logic continues to be pretty strong. Memory is kind of a different factor, more associated, I think, in the DRAM case, with concerns about PC. And flash, I think, there is just some general conservatism. But you have to look kind of customer-by-customer. But I'd say mostly softening in foundry right now, and there should be some recovery as we go forward after the September quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Citi.
Unknown Analyst - : This is Wenge [ph] for Tim. A couple of things. You mentioned about incremental weakness in the last 2 quarters. Can you provide a little bit more color on that?
Mark Dentinger: Well, yes. Just as Rick had said earlier -- this is Mark, and we can obviously see it in the demand forecast that are rolling up from our field sales operations. As you can see from some of the other semi-players that are out there right now, we're all feeling it a little bit. And I do think you have to bear in mind that we're coming off of a 5-quarter run that was 15% higher than anything we've experienced in our history. So, some sort of a pause is probably an order at some point.
Unknown Analyst - : So Rick, the general view is CapEx for 2011 is lower than people expected at the beginning of the year, but if you look the Big 3s, Intel actually raised their CapEx in the earnings. And TSMC, CapEx only down 5%. And there's some indication that Samsung might actually increase their memory spending. We will see what they say tonight in the earnings. So if the big 3 hasn't cut any CapEx, where have the drop off happen? And then could you just give us some details on which type of customers are actually cutting their CapEx? And how do they compare to the big 3s?
Richard Wallace: Well, yes. I hear what you're saying. I do think that there is still a view out there that you still could have an up year. It's just you have a front-end loaded year, and so you get a down quarter. When we do our analysis, there's a scenario that you can get a 5% up in 2010. I'm talking industry-wide, if you have a 25% down in September followed by a 5% up in December, you'd still have 5% up overall. So you still have an industry growth. Now the question was, during the year, there was a range of 0% to 10%. And then early in the year, people thought 5% to up 10%, and then towards the middle, it looked more like up 10%. And now, I think it's kind of -- right now the current view that we're modeling for industry is probably in the up 5% range. So you'd look year-on-year, but that doesn't mean that the second half in that case is down actually 25% from the first half, on average, even though for a year, you're up. Does that make -- does that math make sense to you?
Unknown Analyst - : Yes, yes.
Richard Wallace: That's kind of ahead, but I think it's early to call whether we really see down 25% in September or not or -- and if we see the bounce back after that.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. One last question. On the 28-nanometer ramp, compared to the 40 nanometer, we know that foundries have suffered quite a bit on the yield issue in 40 nanometers. Based on what you've seen on 28, is the yield issues getting more difficult, or it's pretty much at the same level?
Richard Wallace: When I talk to customers -- and we have a lot of conversations the last couple of weeks, I'd say more difficult, more challenging. And 40 was interesting because as you know, a lot of people are going to do 45 and then they move to 40, and they were surprised by how difficult the yield was. And that was the catalyst for a lot of business for us. But if you look at 28, it's actually harder. Now they're a little more aware of the challenges, but we're getting pushed very hard to bring out our latest capability and technology to get it in line because I think our customers are pretty aware that they're missing critical defects in areas that are going to cause problems for them. And there's also a metrology challenges. So I think more difficult and a lot of interest in technology buys. And obviously, if we did have a prolonged softening, I think the technology position for K-T plays pretty well into that space because of the yield challenges they're seeing. No question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: I guess first question, Rick, you guys are really in the sweet spot of spend from logic and foundry in the first half -- the first 3 quarters of the year. And I guess there is a concern out there that as we go into next year, that foundry won't be quite as robust as a percentage of the mix. We'll see maybe a little bit more NAND in the mix and Intel in there. But that overall, a little less favorable for you guys. So curious whether you agree with that and then if you do, whether you can grow as fast as the industry based on either growth in adjacent businesses like LED, et cetera, or increasing capital intensity at the 28-nanometer node will drive higher spend for process control from foundry and/or increasing intensity on the NAND side. We'd love to hear your thoughts.
Richard Wallace: Yes. Sure, C.J. Great question. I think that -- there is no question, we're seeing a -- maybe a consolidation in terms of the spending that was made in foundry and people are dealing with the digestion, which means for the next 4 quarters, our view is foundry intensity versus the last 4 is going to be lower, even though we think it's probably lowest in the next quarter and then we see some improvement as we go out. We do have some additional kickers which help us in memory, and they're not perhaps as obvious as you might think because we also have some market share wins in areas recently in memory, things like OCD, which I think helped provide additional catalyst. We've got areas like overlay, where we're strong. And so you have to kind of look broadly across the portfolio to see the opportunities for us. But there's no question that the softening right now in the current market environment, our foundry is a little bit softer. And we're working hard in the NAND and we're seeing some wins there. But overall, I think that if you consider that we probably outran the industry -- we're talking about industry growth in 2010 of maybe 5% CapEx and we are probably 20%, I wouldn't expect a 15% delta from overall industry. But I could envision us outgrowing the industry in a 5% kind of target range. But I think it will be hard to get that 15% without the foundry intensity where it was. That said, the foundries, as we talked before on the 28-nanometer yield, we think that the adoption in those is going to continue to be strong as a percent of overall CapEx based on their needs. But it's not. I agree, the intensity level -- it's just hard to make the math work if you have a soft Q1 with a slightly recovering Q2 for us.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: That's very helpful. And if I could just ask one quick follow up. In terms of that $1.4 billion backlog, how should we think about, I guess, the relative out-performance or the help there in terms of your revenue recognition? And then I guess, more importantly, at what point -- and I know this is a tough on to answer, at what point do you think you'll start to build the backlog again?
Richard Wallace: Well, I actually can answer the second question easier than the prior, and that is the backlog builds obviously when the order rate exceeds the revenue rate. So we're -- if we could sort of forward -- fast forward into the second half of this year and the first half of our fiscal, if we were to build orders in the December quarter, that would start to get -- that may get close. It sort of depends on how far down Q3 is. But we actually ate into the backlog a little bit this quarter. We needed to do that a little bit just because we had built so much we needed to ship it out. And it continues to profile out, but most of the backlog should ship out over the next 6 to 9 months. If we were in a prolonged down, we will eat into it pretty considerably. But if it's just a temporary lull in the demand, there's a good chance we'll be dealing with a sizable amount of backlog in the next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS.
Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank: This is Mahavir Sanghavi for Stephen Chin. Rick, just one question on the fourth quarter -- I mean, you said 3Q is going to be bottom like -- and fourth quarter you need help from foundry. Did you call 3Q a bottom? Is that right way to read it?
Richard Wallace: I'm sorry. Fourth quarter, you're talking calendar, the December quarter?
Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank: Sorry, yes, calendar fourth quarter. I mean, you need help from foundry? And you called 3Q a bottom, right?
Richard Wallace: Not a lot. Not a lot.
Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. Is that -- and as just a quick follow up, is that -- could you give us a breakdown of your backlog in terms of foundry, memory and logic?
Richard Wallace: Yes. We don't disclose that. We do disclose the components in terms of how much of it has been shipped and hasn't shipped, which I did on my prepared remarks. About 70% of it that hasn't shipped yet, but about 30% has.
Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. And could you also give us some color on the breakdown of the -- of 1Q fiscal '11 orders?
Richard Wallace: In terms of...
Mahavir Sanghavi - UBS Investment Bank: Foundry, memory?
Richard Wallace: Yes. So we're forecasting for September foundry about 50%. We will see -- and this is all of the semi, probably 30%-ish in logic, and probably 20% in memory. But outside of that, our non-core semi grows to about 7%. And if you'd back up and think about service, which is neither of those 2, service bumps up to a larger number, like in the 27% range in the overall order book based on the way we're modeling it right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel, Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I know process control has a little bit of a different dynamic versus some of your other equipment peers. But given that there's a lot of uncertainty and fluidity out there in the overall customer base for you guys right now, how quick can you respond? Just looking at your inventory levels, I mean, they still manage really well. But are you going to be able to turn things around should your customers change their mind at the last minute?
Richard Wallace: I was probably thinking about that as we come off a record shipping quarter. We got a lot of capacity available to us in the system. So I don't see that being an issue relative -- in fact, we're still chasing and we're late on deliveries still today. So where -- manufacturing still running pretty full out to satisfy -- remember all the backlogs that we've got, as Marc said, 70% of that backlog is not shipped. So actually, a slight slowdown in demand wouldn't be the worst thing in terms of our ability to respond quickly to customer needs. And our problem has been kind of the other.
Patrick Ho - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Maybe just a bigger-picture question about EUV and some of the, I guess, the traction or the development there. I know that that's a potentially big opportunity for you guys down the road. But what are some of the potential opportunities should that be delayed and quad patterning takes hold? Is that something that you guys can also capitalize upon before EUV is adopted?
Richard Wallace: Yes, it is. I think that we're in an interesting position because of our -- benefit that we get from the increasing overlay requirements and all the lithography associated, metrology requirements, if you go into additional patterning steps that creates opportunities for us there. There is also even opportunities in registration measurement of radicals. So we have businesses that would benefit from that trend. And we're already seeing -- I think there's a bifurcation, by the way, where EUV, based on its current trajectory, gets used for some layers, and say DRAM first. But there's still additional exotic lithography technologies that are going to push our ability in metrology businesses, in particular. So we are seeing benefit from that. I think that continues. EUV, eventually though, I think the industry does need it to drive -- continue driving down Moore's law. But our expectation is the roadmap is somewhat delayed on the EUV right now, and we do see benefit in the metrology space as a result.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Rick, you took -- a couple of weeks ago, you guided down 10% to 20%, and you think 30% down. And to some extent, that's consistent with what we heard from Lam and I just got off a nanometrics call, and they said they got a call 3 days back, a DRAM customer pushing out. So maybe you can describe to us in terms of what changes in the last 2 weeks, and do you agree with the DRAM customer pushout?
Richard Wallace: Yes. I don't have a specific on a DRAM customer, maybe they just lost some competitive orders. I think that the -- I think that what we're really seeing is a clear sense of softness in the September quarter and then a lot of speculation about what might happen in December based on discussions. And so I share the view of the some of the other peer companies that the visibility is pretty miserable when you get out into the December. So we're basing it on plans that people had in place and discussions. But I don't think we're going to really know a lot about December until we get through, frankly until early September is my expectation because I think there's just enough uncertainty out there right now. But, yes. I mean, when we model it -- and our view is, remember, modeling bookings for us is that different level of scrutiny needs to go into that because of the backlog that we have and for people that are book shipped, it's a different game. And we're able to run revenues significantly above bookings based on the backlog that we've got. And so we do some back-of-the-envelope calculations. But I think if you overly analyze and try to estimate exactly what's going to happen in December, you'd spend a lot of effort on something that's very hard to forecast at this point.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And so in terms of your forecasting process, I would assume that one of the inputs probably will be -- what's the foundry utilization? I know it's difficult to call, but do you have a view on how the foundry utilization will track over the next 3 to 4 quarters?
Richard Wallace: Yes. And we have several scenarios for that. But what's interesting is the soft part of the foundry utilization is not in the capitally intensive part of foundries, which is -- it's the 65-nanometer and plus is where the utilization has softened, and that's not where the business is for us. The question then is, does it slow the adoption of the tape-outs that are being done and have been done at 28? And right now the number of tape-outs is still significantly larger at this point in the cycle for 28 than it was for 40 or 45 at the same point in their relative history. So I think it has to do with the confidence of the customers of the foundries to go ahead and place big orders for that. And I think that there's a little bit of waiting time in that to see. So we have different scenarios. And you're right, you have to model that into your assumptions. But in the end, it -- you could try to be as precise as you want, but these things swing in big ways.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And so one last question on the wafer side. I think we've talked about this before, and there was some lumpiness. So, do you -- has that -- after the Japan earthquake, has that business now stabilized? And do you expect that to be stable, or it is going to have similar volatility as cap equipment, semi-cap?
Richard Wallace: Well, I think in the sense that they recovered and it's fairly back up and operational, really remarkable recovery there. And our team was part of that. I think that, that has stabilized the uncertainty around supply, which has been very important for the rest of the supply chain. But in terms of the overall wafer, as you know, the wafer guys are going to be driven by starts. And I do think they've had a signal to back off a little bit as people figure out exactly where their capacity orders and levels are going to be. So I think there's a little bit of softness in that. Were benefiting in the wafer because we've introduced new products and new technologies. We talked about the SP3 at SEMICON West as a great example of a product that will sell into a market even if it's not expanding because of the technological capability and the push that our wafer customers are getting from their customers to make sure that they meet the levels of these activities that they can really only ensure with the new product. So I think we've got some -- in addition to the traditional capacity sales in the wafer market, I think we have some technology sales to go along with that. So we feel pretty good about our position there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: I'm just trying to understand how should we model the flow and the revenues for the fourth quarter? So I mean, is it -- I mean, is it fair to say that half the shipments are the third quarter will become revenues in the fourth quarter? And half the shipments in the fourth quarter will become revenues in the fourth quarter? They can in those quarters?
Mark Dentinger: Yes, it's -- actually, Atif, this is Mark, and it's -- that's not a bad way to look at it. At least, as we enter the quarter, the shipment linearity, as what we call it, how much we ship the beginning of the quarter versus the end of the quarter will make -- will have a lot of determination on what we ultimately have revenue in December. But your starting point isn't a bad way to look at it.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Great. And then on the non-semi side, Rick, can you just kind of elaborate where you guys are seeing share momentum and maybe higher-than-market growth in which segments of the non-semi market?
Richard Wallace: Sure. I think the -- so, really, 3 places there. We have back-end packaging, which I think has been pretty solid. We've got a great position in that, and we see continued activity there. We have the solar market, where we have a strong position, but a -- I think a pause there also as people are digesting capacity on the solar. But the High Brightness LED, we've got a really strong position there, very strong product offering from our Candela division that does close monitoring of the epi wafers, which turns out to be very important for yield performance. And that's really been a very successful product for us. And I think we're participating well in the High Brightness LED as a result of that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch: This is Thomas again. Just a quick follow-up from me. And I know you spoke about this a little before, but in light of TSMC's report this morning that utilization is down but could actually start picking up again as soon as the December quarter timeframe, could you add a little bit more color on how that factors into your outlook and how you see that playing out from a foundry spending and order standpoint going into early 2012?
Richard Wallace: Sure, Thomas. As you know, we don't talk about specific customers. But just to give you a view of foundry, maybe generically, our view is that this is a pause period, perhaps a slowdown as people consolidate, as I said, and they've got a lot of capacity on line. I think it's getting that feeling on some of the yield challenges. But then on to the next technology nodes, which means when we forecast out for the next several quarters, we see the September quarter being softer, but then reason for encouragement beyond that based on factors such as foundry recovering. I got asked a question earlier today talking about overall for the next 4 quarters, do you see foundry intensity being as high? And we don't want aggregate it, but if you ask me a year from now do I think foundries are going to be investing heavily? I think if you believe that we're in a long-term positive cycle then, of course you'd see the foundries come back after what would be a very reasonable kind of adjustment after a prolonged long period of investment. So, yes, we would see that phenomenon occurring across the foundry space.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood for closing remarks.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Jessica, and thank you all for joining us today. This concludes our conference call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Hello, my name is Sean, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Sean. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to KLA-Tencor's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer.

In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause these differences is contained in our filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2010 Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, you can be reassured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us on our call today. I'll focus my commentary on summary highlights of our March quarter results and provide guidance for June. Then I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of the financials, and we'll conclude with Q&A. KLA-Tencor's March results features another quarter of high levels of demand, record quarterly revenue and earnings and strong cash flows. These results showcase KLA-Tencor's market and technology leadership and the dedication of our global workforce, driven by our culture of innovation and focus on the customer. They also demonstrate the strength of our business model and its profit and cash generation ability, as well as our continued commitment to delivering industry-leading financial performance. That performance enables us to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases at a level that sets the company apart from our technology peers. Here are some highlights of the Q3 results. New bookings grew 18% sequentially to finish at $853 million, representing the second-highest quarterly bookings level in company history. On our January earnings call, we gave an initial range of bookings guidance for the March quarter to be flat to up 20%. Then in February, we updated that view by observing the bookings we're trending to the top of the range or above. The final bookings results came in just below our updated outlook due in part to order timing issues that emerged late in the quarter.  Third quarter revenue grew 9% compared with December, ending above the guidance range at a record $834 million. And we ended Q3 with over $1.4 billion in total backlog, positioning the company to continue to deliver revenue and profitability at historically high levels as we move ahead. We also achieved a new high in quarterly non-GAAP net income of $225 million or $1.31 per diluted share in Q3. Underlying these record earnings were gross margins of 61.3% and record operating margins of 38.6%. Clearly, the value we are creating for our customers and in helping them solve their most complex yield challenges is being reflected in the strong adoption and record financial performance we're reporting today.  Cash flow from operations was at a healthy $244 million in Q3, and our balance sheet is strong ending the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and investments. And consistent with our continued commitment to return value to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $58 million of our stock in Q3 in addition to paying our regularly quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share.  Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture. Orders in March quarter demonstrated the continuing trend of high demand we're experiencing in the cycle. In fact, in the past 4 quarters, KLA-Tencor has booked over $3.3 billion of new orders for an average of about $830 million per quarter. This amounts to 14% growth over the previous 4-quarter company high for new orders set in the 2006 to 2007 timeframe. This growth is a result of our market leadership, strong adoption in the core, growth in services and the addition of new markets. The order book for March shows another strong quarter from the foundries, with foundry bookings at 58% of total new orders. Foundry demand remained at a high level as increased technical complexity at the leading edge, intense competitive dynamics and rapid growth of new fabless designs are all driving very strong adoption of process control. Bookings from memory customers grew to 27% of the total in the March quarter, with NAND accounting for 73% of memory orders in the quarter. And logic was 15% of bookings in March driven by requirements to support 22-nanometer production ramps this year and in 2012. Though there are some uncertainty clouding short-term visibility in the marketplace today, overall market fundamentals remain healthy and the market leaders are reporting strong revenue growth and profitably. It is our view that the industry is in a multiyear growth cycle, fueled by customer adoption of new, breakthrough products and services that leverage the convergence of computing, the Internet and mobility. In this dynamic environment, our leading-edge customers continue to invest at a high level to advance Moore's Law to leverage the competitive and cost advantages of having world-class manufacturing capabilities at the leading edge. As a result, industry capital intensity is on the rise. And with the increasingly more complex technical challenges our customers are facing as they evaluate multiple options for driving Moore's Law, we're also seeing higher adoption of process control. These conditions play into our strength as a market leader. And with our backlog, industry-leading business model and strong balance sheet, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to continue to drive superior financial performance and shareholder returns as we advance through this cycle. Moving now to June quarter guidance. Gross bookings are projected to be flat to down 20% in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $840 million to $900 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.28 to $1.44 per share.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the financial results of the quarter. Mark?
Mark Dentinger: Thank you, Rick. Consistent with our recent history, we will present our income statement in 2 formats: one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which exclude amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, any expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. There was a $0.09 per share difference between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. The difference consisted of: Acquisition-related amortization charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes; continuing expenses related to indemnification obligations of former corporate officers related to stock options backdating litigation of about $3 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes; and an $8 million noncash tax charge resulting from a cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings increased our non-GAAP earnings by $0.05 per share. Q3 new orders were $853 million and net orders were $856 million. The regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: The U.S. was 25% of new systems orders in Q3, up from 19% in the December quarter; Europe was 16% of new systems orders, up from 10% in Q2; Japan was 17%, up from 5% last quarter; Korea was 9%, down from 16% last quarter; Taiwan was 23%, down from 45% last quarter; and the rest of Asia was 10%, up from 5% in Q2. The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution were as follows: Wafer inspection was 48% compared with 30% last quarter; Reticle Inspection was 10%, down from 26% last quarter; metrology was 19%, down from 20% in the prior quarter; solar, storage, LED and other non-semi was 6%, up from 5% last quarter; and services were 17% of new orders in Q3, down from 19% last quarter. Finally, for semiconductor systems, the approximate distribution of new orders by market was: 58% of orders in Q3 were for foundry customers versus 72% in Q2; logic customers were 15% of orders in Q3 versus 8% in Q2; and memory orders were 27% in Q3, up from 20% in Q2. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q4 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q3 new orders, order range of approximately $680 million to $855 million. In Q3, we shipped $823 million versus $828 million last quarter. The shipment number includes both system shipments and services revenue, and we expect shipments of $850 million to $900 million in Q4.  Total backlog at the end of Q3 increased slightly from December 31, and we ended the quarter with $1.4 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31, 2011, include: $383 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue; and a little over $1 billion in systems orders that have not yet shipped. Total revenue for Q3 was $834 million, up 9% from $766 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 10% to $691 million, compared with $628 million in Q2. And services revenue was $143 million in Q3, up about $4 million from Q2. Our expectation for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $840 million and $900 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 61.3% in the March quarter, up 1.2 percentage points from December. Gross margin percentage improvement from last quarter was largely a function of volume increase in systems revenue mix. For Q4, we are expecting gross margin improvement, consistent with our long-term model of 60% to 70% incremental margin on the Q4 revenue increase. Operating expenses were $190 million in Q4 and were split evenly between R&D and SG&A. OpEx was up about $6 million from the December quarter, mostly for variable compensation, and we expect a small increase in our operating expenses in Q4. OIE was a net $10 million expense in Q3, about $7 million lower than Q2. The OIE decrease from last quarter followed a write-down of an equity investment in our venture portfolio during Q2. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q4. In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $87 million or 28% of pretax income versus $72 million in Q2, which was also 28% of pretax income. Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.31 per share in Q3, up from $1.10 last quarter. If we apply our model tax rate of 30%, our Q3 non-GAAP earnings would have been $1.27 per share. At the revenue range we had previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.28 and $1.44 per share. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q3 were 171.3 million versus 169.5 million in Q2. Our average share count rose in Q3 because the diluted share count was based on a higher stock price.  During Q3, we spent about $58 million repurchasing about 1.3 million shares, and as of March 31, 2011, we had approximately 10.4 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling the same average share count as Q3. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.8 million, up about $200 million from the end of December. Cash generated from operations was $244 million in Q3 compared with $194 million in Q2. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $566 million, up from $531 million in December. DSOs were 62 days at March 31 versus 63 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factory. Net inventories increased by $52 million from December 31 and ended the quarter at $557 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.5 turns in Q3 versus 2.6 in Q2. Capital expenditures were $14 million in Q3 versus $12 million in Q2. Total headcount at March 31 was 5,386, up from 5,267 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4.  In summary, our guidance for Q4 is: New orders, flat to down 20% from Q3; total revenue between $840 million and $900 million; and non-GAAP EPS between $1.28 and $1.44.  This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open up the call to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] And so operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Rick, a couple of them. Number one, you spoke about the order timing issues. Can you be more specific as to -- did these get pushed into the June quarter or did they get pushed beyond that and which customer verticals are they from?
Richard Wallace: Sure, Krish. We saw at both foundry and memory and they got pushed into June.
Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch: Into June, okay. And when you look into your June quarter order mix, what do we think about from a mix shift point, whether it's foundry, NAND, DRAM and logic?
Richard Wallace: Yes, well, we finished about 27% in memory for March and that looks pretty consistent with what we're seeing for June. Logic was 15%. We think that's going to be up to about 20%. And foundry was 58%, and we see that dropping down to about 51%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays Capital.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: Rick, I think there's a debate out there as to whether we're in a pause right now or the beginning of a downturn, and in your prepared remarks, you talked about a multiyear cycle. And given your greater leverage to foundry and logic, and clearly that's an important driver of sustaining this cycle. We'd love to hear your thoughts on what gives you the confidence that this, in fact, is a multiyear cycle and that this is just a pause.
Richard Wallace: Yes, sure, CJ. I think that the reaction that our customers have had, and I've talked to many of them both semiconductor, even the fabless guys, as well as the manufacturers, is that the pause that we're seeing is largely driven by some of the uncertainty that was created by the events in Japan. And I think that, that put the brakes on what was otherwise a still tremendous demand out there. So I expect and what we're modeling is a couple of quarters of digestion of all the capacity that's been purchased, but then a resurgence. And for us because KLA-Tencor is so leveraged against the challenges of Moore's Law, we're seeing now in memory some of the early phenomena we saw in Foundry which is the need for more inspection measurement as people push on their design rules. So as I said, I think we see probably a couple of quarters and then growth returning. Customers are still talking about a lot of projects later in the year and I just think it's a momentary delay in that.
Christopher Muse - Barclays Capital: And your sense is based on your conversations and those projects, you talked about that you could see a pickup sometime in the second half or is it something that you would expect in 2012?
Richard Wallace: It's very hard, CJ, to forecast that far out, but the conversations we're having lead more towards the second half, the end of the second half, I think if you think around the December quarter. But historically, June is usually a pretty good quarter for us, but we see some down draft now and then it will depends a lot on general, overall consumer confidence I think will be a part of the driver. I'd say more towards the end of the calendar year than into '12.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: I guess, Rick, the issue that you had mentioned there, that fact that June's usually a little bit better for you, are you seeing any of those dynamics in June that's kind of partially offsetting some of the other things that are going on? Or is it just not your typical seasonal year end?
Richard Wallace: Jim, it's hard to just call it because it's early and I think we're 6 weeks back from -- about 6 weeks from the event in Japan, and that I think for a lot of people, that got people to back off. I'd say in the last couple of weeks, things have actually strengthened a little bit in our view of June. And so at the quarter that we ended, even though we were off what we thought we were going to do in March, it's still our second-highest quarter ever. And so we're guiding flat to down 20% in anticipation there may be some room to see the order book fill up as we get towards the end of the year. But I think it takes a little while for this uncertainty to work its way through, and that's really what we're trying to factor in, in that as well.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: And then if I could just ask a follow-up. You talked about the capital intensity going higher and that could be true, but if customers don't need capacity because they have too much supply, then it doesn't really matter whether it costs more or less or the same to add capacity this cycle versus the last cycle. So I mean, isn't the amount of capacity or excess capacity that some customers may be sitting on at the end of the year a bigger driver for the business in 2012 than the capital intensity question?
Richard Wallace: For sure. I think the question will be what happens to the advanced starts, because right now the softness we've seen is actually not in the most advanced starts, it's in the older technologies. And so the intensity, of course, is driven by the newer stuff and there still are a lot of takeouts that aren't coming through the system. So that's a part of what we see coming down the road is a lot of advanced technology work. So for K-T, in particular for us, we think that leverages our strength as well even if there weren't as much capacity coming on line as the challenges associated with the new technology.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: Just a follow-up, Rick, on the orders by customer type in the June quarter. How are you modeling NAND versus DRAM in the June quarter? Is NAND likely to remain the very strong customer type not only in June but I guess through the rest of the year?
Richard Wallace: Yes, we are definitely seeing more strength in NAND. NAND was about 73% of the total of the memory business that we had, and we see it in the same kind of range for the June forecast. As you well know, Stephen, the DRAM is driven by PC demand where we've seen softer demand and that is not something we're modeling short term. I think there is a longer-term trend there, but right now, that's not where the, business is coming.
Stephen Chin - UBS Investment Bank: And then, can I just ask a question on KLA's opportunity to help rebuild some of the customers' semiconductor wafers facility to Japan? Is there an estimate on how you would size, what kind of investment might be required to help these customers rebuild the raw wafer facilities? And do you think this is perhaps a multiyear investment cycle for your raw wafer customers?
Richard Wallace: There's certainly a tremendous amount of energy on getting those fabs back up and running and the latest estimates report I got even as recently as yesterday, was a desired pull-in from getting the fab fully back up. And so we're seeing some opportunity there where we're in some cases, we've got some critical tool types for them that we're working very hard to get back into production and then there's some additional capacity I think that's going to be required, not just there but around the world, to balance some of the shortfall that we're seeing there. So some opportunity, we don't give it a particular dollar size. The wafer component of our business is meaningful, but I would say it's still, on a relative basis, reasonably small for the overall K-T footprint.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Crédit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG: Rick, I was wondering, how you see the spending pattern in the foundry space from the first half to second half. Then 2 big foundries have sort of guided first half CapEx to be about 2/3 of their total CapEx. I was wondering how you see that tracking for process control?
Richard Wallace: Yes, Satya, I think that there is no question. We benefited so far in the year and the last year from the foundry spending. When we modeled the overall year to be up still we think 10%, 10% to 15% for the overall CapEx for the year, very much dependent on how long this pause goes on. And we expect even in the June quarter, our reliance on foundries are reduced down to the 50% and obviously, we are at 72% if you go back to December. So we are seeing the other segments increased for us. I think foundry, there's a couple of factors that are having to be taken into account right now. It's not just 1 or 2, there are 4 players that are actively investing in foundry, and we're still seeing that level of investment although there has been some caution recently. So I would say if there's upside to our overall fiscal, I'm sorry, the rest of the calendar year, it would be that the foundries actually increased their investment off of what we're modeling. We're modeling that perhaps a good part, I wouldn't say 2/3 of the overall, but a good part has been committed already.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG: Okay. Understood. How do you see the trends on the other business, the data storage, solar, LED, packeting businesses, I mean, are they -- I'm assuming on a different sort of spending cycle I was wondering how to think about the growth there over the next few quarters?
Richard Wallace: Right. Well, they're very different, those 3 in particular. I would say that we are seeing good business but on a relative basis, we're up on quarter-on-quarter and those businesses held in there in terms of that growth rate. I think that in TV, we're seeing some overall strength for us, an opportunity, but there is some hesitation recently in that market as well. High-Brightness LED has its own dynamics. There are more yield challenges. We're seeing good opportunity there. And I think the disc drive stuff has been a little bit slower and probably we won't see as much although we have some great product offerings there. So we're modeling them at 6%, I think, of the overall business and probably throughout the year, 6% to 8% is about the right way to think about those businesses for us, $200 million to $250 million. And I think over time they will grow, but the growth is not going to be linear.
Satya Kumar - Crédit Suisse AG: You guys presented at the SPIE Conference on EUV lithography. Is that something that we should think about in terms of an opportunity?
Richard Wallace: Well, we're very early days on that. So I think although I know you're a long-term guy, that's more like the 2015, 2016 timeframe for us. So that's quite a ways out there. But we have an exciting technology and a lot of customer interest, but we're not going to see the impact of that to our revenue picture for several years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup Inc: Just a follow-up on that question about litho. EUV is really struggling right now obviously, and I'm wondering whether one or the other outcome of that is kind of better for you, because if emerging gets extended, that's probably I would think a better deal for you the next couple of years because it will require more inspection I would think. So I wanted to get your opinion on that. And secondly, I wanted to see whether in the past couple of weeks, pretty much everybody has been talking about some pushouts, and I'm wondering sort of what the tone is with respect to broader pushouts, or if it's still very customer specific. And I did join the call late so you might have answered that.
Richard Wallace: Yes, Tim, I think, good question. The first one on litho, we're relatively agnostic. I think that the challenge with the EUV, there's plenty of challenges that's already driving business for us in the Reticle Inspection even for expecting blanks as well as inspecting the early layers. Double patterning pushes very hard on some of our metrology capabilities, specifically overlay. I think the other trend that's out there frankly is if EUV continues to get pushed, there will be more and more interest in going to 450 as a way to reduce cost. And I would say that I'm far more of the belief that that's going to happen in the last 6 months than I was in the last year before that. I just think there's going to be a desire for productivity which is good for K-T but in a different timeframe. So as it goes forward, we're definitely getting business out of the EUV investment that's going on, but we are benefiting from double patterning. So I don't think it really swings too much on us either way. In terms of pushouts, we've seen the same impact others have seen. I don't think it's limited to 1 or 2 customers. I think there is a broader sense out there of a pause and I think that's a part of what we're seeing as a general pause in the market as people try to assess the impact. A lot of it's second order. I don't think that they're necessarily seeing it on their own. They're just trying to wait and see what happens. Our estimate is we're about 6 weeks through since the initial events in Japan. I'd say in the next 6 weeks, we'll get a lot more clarity as we get later towards the end of the June quarter.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Just to follow up on one of the answers you gave, you said you're guiding down 10% but hopefully as we progress through the quarter, maybe the orders fill up, being your stronger quarter. Where would you get the upside from? Will it be -- are you expecting on the memory side or logic side?
Richard Wallace: Well, Mahesh, we said flat to down 20%. And obviously, the midpoint of that is down 10%. I think it's hard to say. I mean, right now we're certainly looking at, caution I'd say across the board is what's going on but still, with a level of investment. I think that certainly some of the backing off that we've seen in some of our customers are both in memory and in foundry. So it would just have to be who happens to come up. The other thing is that you know based on our product mix and portfolio, we do have some high-dollar products, that all you have to see is one or two of those come in and that would move us up in the average. So I wouldn't say it's specific to any particular segment. I think it's more a general and I think it could be from a number of places. But we monitor on a weekly basis, what the order book looks like and there's puts and takes every week.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Actually, that said, that's a very interesting point, you talked about. I'm sure you're talking about Reticle Inspection. And just a follow-up on that, how is that Reticle Inspection spending be linked with the overall capital spending? Are they usually aligned? Or is there an offset? And if there is an offset, can you talk about a little bit on that one?
Richard Wallace: It's not, I'd say, it's uncorrelated. It may occasionally look, if you mapped it out, that it's based upon some kind of correlation. But I think there are a couple of driving factors. One has to do with advanced design starts. When those increase and people reach a capacity point where they need an incremental number of tools, you'll see big movement. These are high-dollar, low-number of tools. So incremental movement is a big, big shift. The other thing I think that happens is along the same lines when there's technology transitions, the EUV, for example, you'll see initial investment associated with being able to handle that transition. So we kind of get it in both, but it's more related to what's going on in the design front and to some degree capacity of advanced masks. And when that happens, then we see trigger. The other thing that happens is when we introduce new capability, we typically create demand for that and you'll see that we get a large number of orders and that will actually work its way through in revenue, which is part of where our strength in our backlog is and why we're at $1.4 billion backlog, is some of those reticle tools that came out last year have booked but we're still working on deliveries of them.
Operator: And as we have no further questions at this time, I'll turn the call back over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you, Sean, and we'd like to thank everyone else for joining us this afternoon.

===== 2011 Q1  (2010-10-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Amanda and I will be your conference operator. I’d like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor first quarter fiscal 2011 conference call. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood of KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Mr. Lockwood, you may begin.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Amanda. And we apologize for the technical difficulties this afternoon. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to KLA-Tencor’s first quarter fiscal year 2011 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer.

More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2010 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements, however, you could be reassured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I’m going to focus my commentary on the summary highlights for the September quarter and then provide guidance for December then Mark is going to follow with the review of the financials. First of all, there is no storage of the bay today as to the pace of the global economic recovery or the near term direction in semiconductor and the semiconductor equipment market. So KLA-Tencor September results demonstrate the process control adoption remains at a very high level. Our numbers also show the company is successfully executing on our long-term strategic objectives, delivering sustained market leadership, strong revenue growth, record margins, record earnings per share in the quarter. New bookings in the September quarter were $785 million that’s the third highest level in the company’s history. The high level of demand we’re experiencing today is driven by the combination of strong adoption in the core market and a healthy contribution from new markets in our services business. Revenues grew 22% sequentially to $682 million significantly above the range of guidance and indicative of the high sense of urgency among our customers for getting our latest generation process control technologies qualified and in place. Non-GAAP earnings, was a record $0.99 per share in Q1, significantly above the guidance range of $0.80 to $0.88 per share. Underlying this outstanding financial performance in Q1, were record non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and record non-GAAP operating margins of 36%. With incremental margins coming in above our 60 to 70% target for gross margin and our 50 to 60% target for operating margins. And we ended the quarter with the $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.4 billion in backlog. Now in response to the high levels of demand we’ve been experiencing lately, we’re focused on driving our operations to meet customer requirements and we are positioned for continued growth in shipments, revenue and earnings as we move forward. Our strong financial performance as a result of KLA-Tencor’s technology and market leadership and it demonstrates the value our technology and services deliver in helping our customers execute their leading edge technology roadmaps. And also helps us sustain a high level of R&D which is essential to achieve our customer focus and growth strategies and provides the resources for us to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. To that end, KLA-Tencor repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for approximately $62 million and paid cash dividends of approximately $42 million in the quarter. As you may recall, on July 13, we announced that our board of directors authorized an increase in the level the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share which took effect with our first quarter dividend. That move reflects management and the board’s confidence in the long-term outlook for the company as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. Turning now on to some specifics of the demand picture, gross bookings in Q1 were $785 million the third highest on record for KLA-Tencor but below the midpoint of the range of guidance for the quarter. The first quarter end market picture was highlighted by a sustained strong demand from foundries coming in at 44% of new orders in the September quarter. Our foundry customers are operating at high levels of capital intensity as they expand capacity to address the heightened competitive environment and increased business levels driven by rapid proliferation of new fabulous designs. Looking at the memory market, bookings for memory customers were 38% of the total in Q1. Well DRAM pricing in PC demand have been declining off late, our leading edge DRAM customers remain very profitable and are sustaining their investments to transition to the 4X nanometer and the 3X nanometer technology nodes. We also saw an increase in NAND equipment demand in Q1 to meet strong bit growth driven by rapid adoption in smartphones and Tablet PCs. Orders from NAND flash customers grew to 72% of memory orders with market leaders investing to ramp 30 nanometer and to qualify 20 nanometer technologies. Logic was 18% of bookings in September, driven by the continued migration to 22 nanometer. Now as you know, technology changes that enable Moore’s Law are constant in our industry. Regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, ship manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products and process control is essential to successful innovation. Although orders remained at a high level compared with historical averages, the downward trend in bookings in the first quarter, following an extended period of robust growth was consistent with seasonality for KLA-Tencor. Is also indicative of a more cautious approach our customers have recently adopted with our capital spending budget, as weakening consumer PC demand and persistent uncertainty regarding the macro economy have impacted the spending in the short-term. However, overall semiconductor industry dynamics remained healthy, and the importance of maintaining cost and performance leadership continues to drive investments at a high level. Current external market estimates have semiconductor revenues growing in the range of 30% in calendar 2010, with growth currently forecast in the mid-single digits for calendar 2011. Fab utilization also remains at a high level and the WFE market is forecast to grow 120% in calendar 2010 with 2011 expected to be roughly flat year-over-year. We’re tracking 13 new fab projects currently in development or scheduled to qualify over the next several quarters. The majority of semiconductor capital spending today is focused primarily on technology investment and not capacity. And that focus is a key driver of the high demand we’re seeing in process control. And with the continued success of new products and sustain market leadership, coupled with our strong backlog and high performance business model, KLA-Tencor is well positioned to deliver outstanding revenue, profitability and earnings as we move ahead. Moving now to guidance. Gross bookings in December are projected to be flat to down 20%. We also expect continued revenue growth and strong margin performance, with December revenue expected to be in the range of 700 million to $740 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers.
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats. One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions. Expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks and operations will refer to non-GAAP information but were a reference GAAP numbers, I’ll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. The differences between this quarter’s GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are: acquisition related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 a share after-taxes and a $9 million non-cash tax charge due to accumulative shortfall position in our employ stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added about $0.06 per share to non-GAAP EPS. Following our record Q4, the Q1 new order total was $785 million which was our third best quarter ever. Net orders were 787 million, revenue and EPS for Q1 were above the top-end of our guidance ranges we issued in July, as we process the strong order pickup we experienced in the last few quarters. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows the U.S. was 21% of new systems orders in Q1, down from 25% in the June quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, down from 12% in Q4; Japan was 7%, down from 12% last quarter; Korea was 24%, up from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 34%, up from 18% last quarter and the rest of Asia was 10%, down from 14% in Q4. The Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows Wafer inspection was 49% compared with 48% last quarter, Reticle inspection was 11%, down from 19% last quarter; Metrology was 17%, up from 14% from prior quarter; solar storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 6% even with last quarter and services was 17% of new orders in Q1, up from 13% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 44% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 41% in Q4. Logic customers were 18% of systems orders in Q1 versus 21% in Q4 and memory system orders were 38% in Q1, even with last quarter. 67% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q1 were for 32 nanometer and below technology versus 41% in the June quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders for fiscal Q2 will be within a range of flat to down 20% from Q1. Shipments in Q1 which include both system shipments and services revenue were $677 million, up from 622 million last quarter. We added a little over $100 million to our backlog in Q1 and ended the quarter with 1.44 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at September 30th included $337 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $1.1 billion in system orders that have not yet shipped. Systems revenue for Q1 was up 28% to $550 million compared with $430 million in Q4. Services revenue was $132 million in Q1, up slightly from $129 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1, is a range between 700 and 740 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62% in the September quarter, up 2 percentage points from June. For Q2, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60 to 70%. Operating expenses were 180 million, up $15 million from the June quarter. About 3 million of the quarter-to-quarter increase resulted from giving our employees new iPad devices and grossing them for taxes. Another 3 million of the increase was due to a Q4 credit in G&A expense for recovery of our claim arising from the Spansion bankruptcy which did not repeat in Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to increase slightly in Q2, in line with our stated incremental operating margin target of 50 to 60%. Other income and expense or OIE, was a net $12 million expense in Q1, about $1 million higher than Q4. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q2. In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expenses $63 million or $0.27 of pretax income versus $41 million in Q4, which was 25% of pretax income. The tax rate increase arose largely from a change in the distribution of earnings between the U.S. and lower taxed international operations. Non-GAAP net income was $169 million or $0.99 per share in Q1. If we exclude the iPad distribution expense and apply our model tax rate of 38 – excuse me, 30%, our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.96. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $1.00 and $1.10 per share assuming a tax rate of 30%. Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 169.8 million versus 171.3 million in Q4. During Q1, we spent $62 million repurchasing about 2 million shares and as of September 30th, we had approximately 3.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We anticipate continuing to repurchase shares in the December quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 169 million for Q2. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at 1.5 billion about even with prior quarter-end. Cash generated from operations was $96 million in Q1 compared with $83 million in Q4. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating cash flow largely resulted because we had $133 million more in customer collections and we did not have to make a $26 million semiannual interest payment this quarter. These effects were partially offset by larger outlays including annual bonus payments we made in September. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at 500 million up from $440 million at June 30th, largely resulting from the $55 million increase in shipments from Q4 to Q1. DSOs were 67 days at September 30th versus 72 days at the end of June. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factoring. Net inventories increased by $62 million from June 30th and ended the quarter at 464 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q1 flat with Q4. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q1 versus $6 million in Q4. Total headcount at September 30th was 5,180 up from 4,989 at June 30th. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q2. In summary, our guidance for Q2 is: new orders flat to down 20% from Q1, total revenue between 700 and 740 million, non-GAAP EPS between $1.00 and $1.10 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we’d like to open up the call to Q&A and we do once again request you limit yourself to one question given the limited time we have for the call today. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up questions and we’ll do our best to get everyone on today’s call. So operator, we’re ready for our question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Anupam Ghose: Yeah, hi. This is Anupam for Satya. I had a question on orders. How do you think orders will be in first half ‘11 and what portion of backlog do you think is shippable within next six months?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, well I’ll take the first part of that and let Mark take the second part. As you know we don’t forecast that far, we don’t guide bookings out into the next calendar year. But I would say that the perspective right now is that calendar ‘11 looks to be flat with calendar ‘10 which of course is significantly over ‘09 whether that’s back-end loaded or not I think lot of factors are at play but I, if I model out the whole year, I think we’re looking at the calendar ‘11 that we think overall is flat. We’re tracking in about 13 new projects and it really depends on the timing of when those projects get released and make their investments.
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, I think you’re – I’m sorry, with respect to your question on what portion of the backlog is shippable over the six months. We typically don’t guide shipments, however, I do understand the nature of your question and because we’re in a hyper ramp right now. I will tell you that our internal plan is to ship north of $800 million in the current quarter and repeat something like that coming out of Q2. So we would expect all of our backlog and maybe even a little more to try to ship out over the next six months. Those shipment figures do include, by the way, services revenue. We wouldn’t typically guide this but I do understand the nature of your question.
Anupam Ghose: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I’m curious on the foundry side, I guess I’d love to hear kind of what you’re seeing there from your customers and whether there was some push outs there in the September is to why your orders came in at the lower end of your guided range. And then thinking a little bit longer term into calendar ‘11, clearly very robust spend for you in calendar ‘10. Can that repeat itself or has a lot of the spend been front-end loaded and I guess within that discussion, I’d love to hear your comments and thoughts around their spend for 28 nanometer in high K metal gate and how that – all of the interplay for foundry’s spend should look as we move into calendar ‘11?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, C.J., sure, good questions. I think that, we did see a bit of softening as we’ve said we’re in the bottom part of the range for bookings for September and not really outside of normal for seasonality for us. But clearly there has been, in spite digestion period we think we’re in right now across the industry and that includes these foundries but there are several projects on the book. So when we look out, there are major foundry players talking about increasing CapEx for calendar ‘11 and we see many projects outside of, just the major players there, you go across the space and there is a lot of investment across foundry. Whether 2011 will repeat? 2010, our current model is we see 2011 normally being flat with what we see 2010 shaping up to be very hard to predict at this time where that’ll happen inside of the different segments, but we think foundries stays pretty long, logic pretty steady and I think DRAM is probably remain soft offset by NAND spending continuing. That’s kind of how we see it.
C.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jim Covello: Hey great guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. The shipments versus revenue, if you’re going to ship 800 for each in the next couple of quarters, how do you think that translates into revenue given recognition issues and things of that nature?
Rick Wallace: I think it’s hard to predict it exactly, Jim. But as you might imagine, we have guided up in revenue for next quarter and we would expected if we actually follow-up through with the shipment plan that we currently got in place obviously the revenue would have to be increasing as we look out to our fiscal Q3 as well. But it will follow in due course, if we need to ship in play.
Jim Covello: You think kind of with the – I know this is hard as you’re saying, but like is it, increase directionally or do you think on an absolute basis consistent with the shipment numbers?
Rick Wallace: I wouldn’t want to get too fine with it, but I would say that the slope of both should be close.
Jim Covello: Okay.
Rick Wallace: Of that.
Jim Covello: Okay, great. And then on the cash, I mean is the plan to continue to do both dividends and the buyback?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Right now, we’re obviously generating a tremendous amount of cash and when we adopted the dividend we obviously had a long-term perspective in mind with our new highly profitable model at current levels. And so, we’re sort of full steam ahead on it.
Jim Covello: Great. Thanks a lot, congratulations.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from the Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Rick, if I look at your order guidance, the spread is about 160 million. What drives the low end and the upper end of that guidance?
Rick Wallace: Well, Krish as you know, there got – these got big projects out there and whether or not they come through, I think you also know that from our perspective, we like to keep range widen up to not have any particular customer feel like they’re going to be the difference between us making inside or outside the range. So big clumpy deals, I do think in this environment you end up with large deals happening and some of them come in now and you certainly – if you’re in our position with the backlog we’ve got, we don’t want to be needy about the orders that their times where the negotiations get pretty deep into the quarter of our price and so on. So we want to leave ourselves in legal room.
Krish Sankar: Got it. And then my final question is, late last year, you guys saw a nice tailwind from TSMC’s yield issues in the first. Now when the entrance in foundries go to sub-4X, are you seeing similar kind of yield issues they’re experiencing and how does that benefit you guys? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Yeah. We’re definitely seeing issues across the board and we’re hearing more and more challenges as people scale down and pushing really hard on our development projects so what it’s doing is, we’re engaging quite close to the customers and helping them come up with strategies to deal with the challenges as advanced as I know. And at the same time, pushing very hard on getting the new products out that are going to help provide the capability to make the inspection necessary to support the advanced node, so no question that the challenges our customers face for yield or are only increasing as we go forward.
Krish Sankar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, Rick. If you look at your shipments and you just take 2010 relative to last year, it’s up about 80% year-over-year and CapEx is up about 2X. Is that just shipment timing, or is there some particular mix that’s causing the shipments to sort of be more back-end loaded in the year and even in the Q1 for you then for your peers? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Yeah, sure. I think that, we look at all of those metrics and I think it’s certainly true that we have some long lead items that take a little time for us to get out. I also think, if you look at bookings were up more, were up about 95% year-on-year, if you count the middle of the range and shipments would be lagging at about 80%, so we’re certainly in line when we look at the booking side, but shipments a little bit delayed. Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is now open.
Max: Hi, this is Max [ph] for Stephen. Thanks for taking my question. Given on spending – memory spending in the next year, would you say KLA market share is stronger at NAND flash customers compared to DRAM?
Rick Wallace: That’s really hard to separate. I think our market share ends up splitting more along specific customer lines, I have to think through tally that up. I don’t think there is a big difference frankly between NAND and DRAM for us in terms of share, kind of comes and goes. Over time, our share ends up being pretty strong in some product lines and obviously not a strong in some others.
Max: All right, thanks. And just one quick follow-up. What do you think the orders by customer type would be in the coming quarter?
Rick Wallace: Sure. Yeah, we’re looking forward to December. We see memory being about 36% of the overall orders and we look at logic, see that about 10% and 54% out of foundry and 7% non-semi.
Max: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Casey: Hi guys. This is Casey [ph], calling in for Mahesh. If you were to look at the range in the bookings guidance, would you say more of the uncertainty comes from foundry versus memory or is it’ll be underground?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, I wouldn’t – yes I wouldn’t attribute to either one. I’d say the range is really more of a broader statement than a specific customer type.
Casey: Okay. And when you look into year, at the moment you’re looking for flat CapEx. What are some of the projects out there, what are the nature of the projects out there back that causes you some lot of concern?
Rick Wallace: Our products or customer products?
Casey: Customers’ projects. Yeah, projects.
Rick Wallace: Oh! The projects that are out there, I see. Well, clearly in 2011, what we’re counting on is continued investment as I said probably steady investment in logic. We think that there would be continued investment in foundry as the foundry competition really increases and actually gets more meaningful, more players investing. I think DRAM is likely to be a little bit soft and the NAND would make that up. So if you take any of those and they don’t hold then that obviously would have a downward pressure. On the other hand, if we see more strength let’s say, in the second half to a DRAM then that could strengthen the position of the DRAM customers driving more investment by them. So when we balance the whole thing, we do come up with a range where we scenarios were its up and then we see scenarios where it’s down and we end it up coming out right in the middle.
Casey: Okay. Good thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you. For the September quarter, can you please provide the mixture of revenue and bookings from ICOS?
Rick Wallace: I’m sorry, for which quarter?
Mehdi Hosseini: For the September quarter.
Rick Wallace: The September. Yeah, we don’t breakout individual divisions but we have said that’s a non-semi which is where we lump the back-end cash for us, because that’s non-front end, non-WFT was about 6% overall of the bookings and forecasted. They’re consistent with what it was in June and forecasted in the December quarter to go into 7%. Now that includes back end test, high grade LED, solar and hard disc drives, storage market. So really it’s rather – it’s broader than what we get out of any one product division, but overall consistent with as a percent with what we saw in June.
Mehdi Hosseini: Understood. And then, would the equipment lead time in my opinion come in and considering a flourish CapEx for next year. Don’t you think that your customers could wait till like Q2 to place the orders that would impact in production for the second half of next year?
Rick Wallace: Oh! Certainly. Yeah, I mean I think that the customer, if you had think our average lead time is on the order of six months for us and certainly they could wait until June to get December shipments and December order fulfillments in next calendar year. Not really a big change I mean, what we’ve really been doing is, is ramping to meet the demand but, I think with a lot of heroic effort, we’re doing that and I think we’re – we’ll be able to continue that, but yeah there is no question that you would have to see bookings in the first half to support the second half numbers.
Mehdi Hosseini: And just very quickly, what should I think your booking guidance and your overall turn of the business relative to some of the other front-end equipment companies that have reported and have been relatively more constructive about the near-term booking momentum?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, I think the biggest difference was, I think we have with many of the peers is the backlog that we have and the strength that we had in prior quarters for us, for example, the June quarter created a lot of backlog on which we’re now working off and so when we look at that and even that given even that scenario we added a backlog over $100 million in the last quarter. So for us, we continue to drive the revenue growth and the earnings that go with that but we actually don’t see that the bookings is going to be at the same level for the December quarter, it will be slightly under but will still have a tremendous amount of backlog in the queue and be able to continue to drive earnings. I think a lot of the other businesses end up being more turns businesses which cause them to perhaps burn up their backlog a lot faster.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hari Chandra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Hari Chandra: Thank you. In terms of the order max, you noted them the technology have a great sound, you’re driving it. Can you give the split between capacity orders versus technology upgrade and also how do you see that percentage is shifting over the next couple of quarters and any particular segment tilting towards capacity?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, I think right now it’s really hard to tell exactly when you look at some of the systems that are placed and except for when you look at pure R&D, because we’re really obviously going to piloted their early part of the ramp and then the product goes forward, but clearly we’re benefiting from the advanced technology nodes. I think the capacity buys are there, but if I had to do a rough split, just on top of my head, I’d say its 60-40 right now technology versus capacity and that that’ll probably trend and I think there is probably coming as we look forward and we think about some of the build outs that are going to happen and things like NAND where you see factors coming online over the next few years it’ll be more capacity oriented. But it’s really hard to say exactly what that split is, given the outside of the pure R&D technology buys. Is that makes sense?
Hari Chandra: Thank you. And one question on the December shipment split, do you see – how do you see that shaping up?
Mark Dentinger: The shipments put you approximately follow the bookings profile.
Hari Chandra: Okay.
Mark Dentinger: If you look to the prior quarter and in this case maybe the prior quarter now.
Hari Chandra: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Sway from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open.
Gary Sway: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Could you guys explain maybe you did explain this on the call but I just didn’t hear, I joined a little bit late so I apologize, but could you explain why there is this re-divergence in terms of shipments in revenue, what in the product mix is driving that divergence or ability of recognized revenue? It seems like you’re building a decent amount of deferred revenue now. And just second question, sort of a bigger picture question with still a lot of sort of new fab projects in the pipeline particularly for NAND in 2011. There is just sort of common perception that NAND is less CapEx intensive then DRAM per semi-cap equipment spending overall. I was wondering if that – the same case for inspection or metrology and whether or not inspection and metrology could actually see higher CapEx intensity with NAND compared to processing.
Rick Wallace: Yeah, I’ll take a part of that and let Mark deal with the divergence, your question on that. Really start with the second part of your question, capital intensity for NAND and DRAM. From our perspective, in a process control world, we are seeing new challenges emerge in advanced design rolls on NAND that even our customers weren’t to wear out that as recently as three or six months ago challenges they’re having. So as a result, we are seeing increased activity and then increased in the process control percentage, the people are willing to invest and need to invest. So I think for us, NAND is going to be a healthy market as we go forward. That said, we still got a lot of work to do to execute on our strategy to support that. And I don’t see, DRAM right now, I just think its overall there are many challenges associating with the technology but we start to see the overall activity level being as high for DRAM in general as we do for NAND. And Mark, can you split?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, let me just take a quick response to your question on the divergence between the shipment profile and the revenue profile. In the – first of all, it usually takes at least 90 days to turn shipments into revenue when you get into just passing the units along installing customer burn in and then final product acceptance. When we are moving in, let’s call it normal circumstances which isn’t that often as it turns out. You will see a 90-day turn of that or a little bit longer than 90-days. When you are in a step-up ramp like we’re in right now. It takes a little bit longer to turn that into revenue. I will say that however, in Q1 we actually revenued ahead of the prior quarter shipment. So we actually revenued 683 this quarter and we shipped 622 last quarter. So it can move back and forth. That won’t every quarter, but it will happen often just to let you know that it should vacillate at 90 or slightly greater than 90 days. I hope that responses to your question. And again, if we meet the shipment, the revenue will follow relatively shortly thereafter in the next couple of quarters.
Gary Sway: Okay. Can I speak out one more question real quickly here? If you guys are going through a digesting face and you’re reflecting that in terms of your order guidance here in the December quarter coming off September, then in September why did metrology kind of hold fast at roughly the 130 million kind of range. I would have thought that if you’re starting to see the impact of capacity digestion, you would have seen metrology kind of downtick a little bit more than any other sector or division for you? Is there a reason for that?
Rick Wallace: Why September, I’m sorry, September metrology held in there, but overall we are down.
Gary Sway: Yeah. Why did metrology of all things hold a better in your order book compared to other segments when we’re going through a little bit of a capacity digestion as you indicated on the call?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Well I think it’s a relative thing, right. I think it from our perspective, in that case there is the metrology that is turns out to be closer to turns business and has to do with supporting capacity where some of our inspection markets are longer in lead and therefore their timing is offset among different product lines. And so, just like process control buys probably had more turns in September, we have more turns in metrology. We also came off of a very strong market period in June for things like Reticle. So it’s a relative basis. Is that makes sense?
Gary Sway: Yeah, absolutely. All right, thank you.
Rick Wallace: You got.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And a nice quarter, nice results. Mark, I have a question, as you think about EUV over the next couple of years, I mean I just want to know your operating expenses, R&D line, is there a reason to believe that and that can kind of creep up into next year because of EUV efforts or if you kind of stick with you actinic approach, you can move around R&D all those from different projects?
Mark Dentinger: No, it actually it’s an interesting observation, that take. It is possible that we could – we would have some upward pressure on the R&D line next year. Just as function of that total OpEx and as a function of revenue. And that could be just as a result of the timing in new product introductions and certainly EUV is a big frontier for us on the R&D side. What you’ll see right now is, is that we previously laid out the model for KLA-Tencor. We’re experiencing levels of profitability in the current performance that we’re considerably ahead of where we were before. And we believe moving into this period, if you – we spoke in, three or four years ago. We believe that we would get a 200 to 300 basis point improvement both from the operational improvement and some of the decisions that we made with respect offshore manufacturing and things like that, 200 to 300 basis point improvement in operating margin. We obviously are getting than that right now, but that is certainly partially a function of the actions we took, but it’s also partially a function of the timing of when new projects come on board and when new R&D hit and it’s possible we could experience some of that pressure as we look out into the first half of next year and certainly beyond that a little bit. But in the long run, we believe, we have obtained 200 to 300 solid basis points of improvement in the operating line.
Atif Malik: Okay. Just to be clear, the absolute dollars and even R&D I think could go higher but, does operating margins could still improve because of better supply chain or outflow?
Mark Dentinger: I don’t know if they would improve as a percentage from here. They should certainly go up as the revenue improves that we are experiencing a really high level of operating margin contribution right now is a function of revenue. And my point is, is that we maybe operating with a little bit of a tailwind in terms of complex R&D project, and if you look out farther than that, 452.
Atif Malik: Got it. And then, just a follow-up, in your non-semi segment, can you – I know it’s a small contribution, but can you give some kind of order on where you saw the most trends in LED, solar or data storage?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, sure. We had a record quarter in solar for the September quarter that’s a small business but it did have a record quarter. I’d say the high brightness LED continues to look good and we continue to see growth there. Obviously there has been some softening in the disc space but we’re actually pretty well positioned with new products there. And then lastly, back in packaging we did see a little bit of softening and we expect that to continue reflecting some of the challenges in the back end on the short-term but we think that’ll recover as we go into next year.
Atif Malik: And are there any big enough technology inflexion points in these markets this year or next year where liquidity could benefit or is it kind of a more of the old?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, there is definitely growth. I mean we’re seeing, and for us it’s a pretty good business segment. If you look overall we’re at a 200, $250 million run rate outside of course semi and we think the long-term growth trajectory of that stays that’s probably 20%. So the challenge is, of course that’s coming off is smaller base relative to the rest of our business. So there are definitely challenges in each of those markets, if you walk through and we’ve got products and we’ve got market position and the ability to invest and drive those as we go forward. So that’s part of our long-term growth plan, but relative to the other side of the business that remains reasonably small.
Atif Malik: Thanks.
Operator: Your last question comes from Jagadish Iyer from Arete Research. Your line is now open.
Jagadish Iyer: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick. First question is that you’ve said about WFE being flat for all other. The question is that, given the mix is going to change between DRAM, NAND and logic and foundry, do you think that you can outgrow the WFE in ‘011 please?
Rick Wallace: We do. We think that again, if I go through it again, I think foundry is flattish, we think that logic is flattish, we think that the increases in the NAND space, having investments there and thus so in DRAM and based on our current positions and the investments that we’re making, certainly it's our plan to continue to grow. We do have the emerging markets as well. So yes, we believe we can continue our strategy of executing growth strategy like, it takes us faster than the overall industry performance.
Jagadish Iyer: Okay. The second question is that, if the orders – if the order pass continues for the next two quarters or three quarters, do you think that you could sustain a gross margin of over 60% if assuming that revenue run rate is over 700 million?
Rick Wallace: Yes. I mean the answer is yes. If you look at our incremental gross margin, we guided up there, we guided 700, 740 and you can infer from our model that’s 60 to 70% incremental gross margin. We got a strong ratchet in that zone with gross margin. So we’re in a strong position. But yeah, we believe that that’s what we’re committed to. We think it’s there and as long as revenue hangs in there, our growth, then we’re in great shape.
Jagadish Iyer: Yeah, one last question if I can squeeze it. Every one of your peers is talking about TFT and wafer-level packaging, can you help me find out, how much is scarlet tracking in terms of opportunities in wafer-level packaging maybe you can speak on that?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, sure. We have plays on that. Obviously we’ve got some work going on in the back-end. We’ve got a very strong position on the businesses that we have there and we think for both wafer-level packaging and TFT we’ve got good opportunities and the potential to add but we want to make sure that those markets really materialize in a way that we would get a good return on those investments. So we’re tracking and then working closely that we believe we’re very well positioned for them.
Jagadish Iyer: Thank you.
Operator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood for closing remarks.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, operator. Thank you very much and thank you all for joining us on our call today and your continued support. This concludes our call.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Presentation :
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood, with KLA-Tencor Corporation. You may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to KLA-Tencor's fourth quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial Officer. We are here today to discuss fourth quarter results for the period ended June 30, 2010. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our web site at www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. A simulcast of this call will be available on demand following its completion on the investor section of our website. There you will also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor’s SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009 and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings you will find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks, and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2009 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements, however, you could be reassured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining our call today. Given that we provided the comprehensive strategic update just two weeks ago at SEMICON West, I'll focus my commentary today on summary highlights of our results and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of the financials. Today's numbers demonstrate the KLA-Tencor's market leadership is as strong as ever and the company is executing at a high level delivering exceptional growth in financial performance against the backdrop of a very robust industry environment. Bookings for the June quarter were $956 million, an increase of 47% compared with March and above our original range of guidance. During the quarter we saw broad based strength in each of our major end markets, geographies and products including record quarterly bookings and our Reticle and wafer inspection businesses. Revenues in June grew 17% to $559 million coming in above the midpoint of the range of guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.70 in Q4, significantly above the original guidance range of $0.54 to $0.62 per share. The growth we are experiencing in the marketplace today is driven in part by strong adoption of profit control in our core semiconductor markets and increase in contribution from new markets and a healthy services business. And underlying our strong profitability performance in the June quarter our non-GAAP gross margins of 60% and non-GAAP operating margins of 31%, both record results for KLA-Tencor illustrating continued success in our operations excellence focus. The healthy profitability and cash generating power enabled our business helped fuel a high level of investment in R&D to enable our customer focus and growth strategies while also providing resources for the company to deliver significant cash returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. To that end, KLA-Tencor generated approximately $448 million in cash flow from operations in fiscal year 2010. And we were active in returning value to shareholders, repurchasing over $136 million in common stock and paying cash dividends of approximately $102 million in the year. Additionally, on July 13th we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized an increase in the level of the company's quarterly dividends, $0.25 per share. This move reflects management and the Board's confidence in our long term outlook for the company as well as the ongoing efforts to reward our shareholders for their continued investment. Looking ahead, end market demand is expected to remain strong as our customers' businesses continue to grow at a healthy pace. Average third-party forecasts show semiconductor revenues projected to be up 28% in calendar 2010 with growth also forecasted for 2011. Plants are running today at high utilization levels and our customers are rapidly migrating to new more complex technologies and investing to improve yields and lower costs. All while operating under tremendous competitive and time to market pressures. In this environment the outlook for profit, controlled investment remains excellent. KLA-Tencor's market leadership and customer focus, the breadth of our technologies and our ongoing operations excellence position the company to capitalize on this robust industry growth and to continue to deliver strong financial performance as we progress through the cycle. Of course, the driving force behind our success is our strong support and collaboration of our customers and business partners as well as the great execution of our worldwide workforce. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of our employees for their contributions in helping KLA-Tencor continue to excel and in shaping our future success. Turning now to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we see continued strong demand across all major end markets with sustained strength from foundry and memory and solid logic demand. Gross bookings in September are projected to be in the range of 750 to $900 million. We also expect continued strong revenue growth and margin performance with September revenue expected to be in the range of $620 million to $660 million and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.88. With that I'll turn the call over to Mark Dentinger for his review of the numbers. Mark?
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats, one under US GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-down of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options-related litigation and certain costs and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks in operations will refer to non-GAAP information, but where I reference GAAP numbers I'll make the distinction. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our website. The summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP to non-GAAP numbers are as follows. Acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 cents per share after taxes, restructuring and severance charges of $3 million before taxes or $0.01 cent per share after taxes and a stock option litigation credit of $1 million pre-tax which had no after tax effect on EPS. Revenue for Q4 was $559 million towards the high end of our guided range of 530 to 570 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.70, Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.66. By almost all measures Q4 was strong and the new order total of $956 million easily eclipsed our prior peak of 824 million. Net orders were approximately $955 million as virtually none of our customers pulled in or scheduled out orders we had processed in prior quarters. We added almost $400 million to our backlog in Q4 and ended the quarter with 1.34 billion in total systems backlog. The backlog at June 30th included $343 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $992 million in system orders that have not yet shipped. The reasonable distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows. The US was 25% of new systems orders in Q4, up from 23% in the March quarter. Europe was 12% of new systems orders, up from 3% in Q3. Japan was 12%, up from 10% last quarter; Korea was 19% up from 16% last quarter. Taiwan was 18%, down from 39% last quarter and the Rest of Asia was 14% up from 9% in Q3. The Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family in the quarter to quarter change in distribution was as follows. Wafer inspection was 48%, even with last quarter. Reticle inspection was 19%, up from 15% last quarter. Metrology was 14% up from 10% in the prior quarter, solar, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 6% down from 8% last quarter and services was 13% of new orders in Q4, down from 19% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 41% of semiconductor systems orders in Q4 versus 50% in Q3. Logic customers were 21% of systems orders in Q4 versus 13% in Q3 and memory systems orders rose slightly to 38% in Q4 compared to 37% in Q3. Orders for 32-nanometer and below technology were 41% of the semiconductor orders received in the quarter. Looking forward we expect that new orders for our fiscal Q1 will be in range of 750 to 900 million. Shipments for Q4 which include both system shipments and services revenue were $622 million, up 21% from $515 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q4 was up 23% to 430 million compared with 350 million in Q3. Services revenue was 129 million in Q4, essentially even with Q3. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range of 620 to $660 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in the June quarter, up two percentage points from March. The improved gross margin percentage in Q4 was better than our incremental target of 60 to 70% largely because of favorable mix between products and services contributions as well as lower excess in obsolete reserve requirements. For Q1 we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60 to 70%. Operating expenses were $166 million, essentially flat for the March quarter. However, a component of the Q3 to Q4 change in operating expenses was a $3 million reversal of bad debt expense we originally reported when Spansion declared bankruptcy in fiscal 2009. Spansion recently issued stock in its new US entity as partial consideration for what we were owed when they went bankrupt. The Q3 to Q4 decrease in operating expenses from the Spansion recovery was mostly offset by increased expenses for variable compensation and additional materials consumption in our R&D activities. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $11 million expense in Q4 about even with Q3. For modeling purposes, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $11 million in Q1. In Q4 our non-GAAP income tax expense was $41 million or 25% of pre-tax income versus $27 million in Q3 which is 27% of pre-tax income. The tax rate improvement in Q4 largely arose from change in distribution of earnings between the US and lower taxed international operations. Non-GAAP net income was $120 million or $0.70 per share in Q4. If we exclude the Spansion recovery credit and apply our model tax rate of 30%. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.65. At the revenue range I previously mentioned we would expect our Q1 fiscal '11 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.80 and $0.88 per share assuming a tax rate of 30%. Weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q4 were 171.3 million versus 173.4 million in Q3. During Q4 we spent $82 million repurchasing about 2.6 million shares and as of June 30th, we had 5.2 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization. We will continue repurchasing shares in the September quarter. For guidance purposes we are modeling an average share count of 170 million for Q1. As announced at the SEMICON West analyst meeting we hosted in San Francisco two weeks ago, our Board of Directors has authorized a $0.10 share increase to our quarterly dividend bringing our total quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. This increase is expected to take effect beginning with the dividend to be declared in August, 2010. The increase will have the affect of raising our cash outlay for dividends to about $43 million per quarter beginning Q1. Turning to the balance sheet cash and investments ended the quarter at 1.5 billion about even with prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $83 million in Q4 compared with $128 million in Q3. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating cash flow largely resulted because we have $14 million more in tax payments in Q4 versus Q3 and we made a $26 million semiannual interest payment in Q4 versus Q3. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $440 million up from $323 million at March 31, largely resulting from the $107 million increase in shipments from Q3 to Q4. DSOs were 72 days at June 30th versus 61 days at the end of March. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts in factoring. The increase in DSOs during Q4 was within our normal range of expectations in periods where business activity is rising quickly. Net inventories increased by $28 million from March 31st and ended the quarter at 402 million. Inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q4 approximately even with last quarter. Net capital expenditures were $6 million in Q4 versus $10 million in Q3. Total headcount at June 30th was 4,989 up from 4,873 at March 31. We expect our headcount will increase slowly during Q1 especially in our manufacturing locations as we adjust or capacity in response to the recent demand increase. In summary, our guidance for Q1 is new orders between 750 and $900 million, total revenue between 620 and $660 million and non-GAAP EPS between $0.80 and $0.88 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pre-tax income. This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A?
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Mark, and as we begin our Q&A today, I would remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question and one brief follow-up so that we can have the opportunity to get to everyone in this call. With that, operator, would you please queue the audience for questions?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess my question is on sustainability. When I look at your backlog and I include deferred revenues it's well over a billion dollars and then I think about memory and how we're still early in adoption there and hearing that next year is going to be even worse and when you look at the breadth of foundry spending with new customers emerging and new fabs next year, can you talk about your views on sustainability of shipments and orders at this run rate and what kind of path or visibility you see into 2011?
Rick Wallace: Hi, C.J. It's Rick. Yeah, I'll take those and maybe Mark can chime in, too. You know, we look at the overall demand picture to start with that and the midpoint of our guide for bookings for September is 825, as you know, and if you look out to what would have to be to be equal to first half of the year, we would need 775 and as you know, December historically has been up from September. This might not be an ordinary cycle. We don't know, but we do see a lot of projects out there, more than we've seen in the past, probably 13 or 14 new fabs being built and a lot of opportunity out there. So we continue to – to be bullish on ramping shipments to support that. You know with all the expectations in 2011 we’ll continue to see strong demand across the board. As you say, this is a very broad bookings picture, so from our perspective it looks pretty good and overall top level forecast for 2011 are positive as well.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: If I could just ask a quick follow-up, on your non, I guess core, semi business and then you talked about other and strength there, what kind of contribution should we see in the second half of '010 and then into 2011? Can that drive a meaningful uptick?
Rick Wallace: I think so. You know, right now, of course, it's being balanced against the very dramatic increase in the core, but, you know, the annual run rate of that business is probably running on the order of $250 million and if you think about the growth rates inherent and the long term secular growth rates of the markets we're serving there, they're actually pretty good growth rates. So I think that the possibility of that increasing in 2011 is pretty high. That's certainly how we're planning it. We have good share in those markets. We're making investments. We'll have new products coming out and there certainly is a lot of customer demand there.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Thank you.
Ed Lockwood: Thanks, C.J.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Thanks so much for taking the question. You know, there's been an awful lot of noise about your share over the last year or so and obviously with the kind of orders you're reporting now it's kind of tough to believe the stories about share loss that have been out there, is there a way that you guys can articulate or measure the share in any kind of helpful way for people?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, Jim. It's a great question. I think the only way we really can do it is with the math of our numbers, comparing our numbers to WFD and then the top down numbers looking at what we think process control is of the overall market and we certainly see process control going up and we're pretty convinced as a percentage overall, but lastly, you know, the thing that I think the best number to look at if you want to see how we're doing competitively is look at our gross margin.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thanks so much.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri from Citi. Your line is now open.
Tim Arcuri – Citi: Hi, this is (inaudible) Tim. Thank you for taking my questions. Recently we see two new players in the foundry space and TSMC is spending record level. So based on historical numbers we see foundry CapEx to be about 15% higher than their prior peak. Do you think such a level is sustainable and particularly after TSMC's (inaudible)? Do you see a pause in foundry spending? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: You know, right now we really don't see any near term pause. I think you do point out there were more players, but I think we – it is important to remember that in the last cycle foundry largely wasn't investing very heavily and you had a lot of IDMs that went out of the market that weren't building fabs and that CapEx just kind of disappeared. What's happening now is it's showing up in the form of these foundries and so I think that the growth in foundries has some legs to it based on the fact that there are more opportunities to pick up more orders from the people that are no longer building fabs and we really didn't see that in the past. The other factor is from a capital intensity perspective, obviously KLA think what does very well when it comes to serving foundries because our products really support their particular business model extremely well. So we think it's a good story for foundries and a good story for KLA-Tencor.
Tim Arcuri – Citi: Great. Just a quick follow-up. In your most recent communications with the foundry customers, have you heard any kind of weakness expressed by some of the old fabs and foundries in the last couple of days?
Rick Wallace: No, it's funny actually quite the opposite. We had some – I would say a few weeks ago we heard some pauses that have turned right back into accelerated requests for demand. So I would say it's actually swung the other way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Banc of America. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of them. Number one, Rick, in terms of the bookings for September, can you just parse it through by the different customer segments, NAND, DRAM and foundry?
Rick Wallace: Sure, Krish. Let me start with that. We look at memory – September forecast we were at 38% and we think we're probably similar range, maybe a little down, maybe a third of our bookings coming out of memory, so we would say 33% and we would say most of that will be DRAMs and NAND maybe a quarter of that 20, 25% somewhere in there. Logic down from 21% down to probably about 12% and foundry actually we do see an increase in our September numbers to in the 50, 55% range. Non-semi should pick up and be a greater percent of our overall book and that was about 6% and we see that going closer to 9% in September.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America:
 t:
Rick Wallace: I can't think of any. I think there are Japanese competitors that have been around the business for many, many years but none come to mind in the core businesses that we serve. You know, I think that many of these Japanese companies stay in these markets for a long time, but we certainly have not seen any change in behavior.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America: Okay, and then the final question is what do you think is process control as a percentage of WFD today? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: We monitor that pretty closely. I think if you look, reasonable numbers out of Gartner around 14%. We think that's got the possibility to grow maybe up to 15% consistent with the thesis that we have had that the increasing complexity is driving the need for increased process control and certainly based on the strength of our bookings, we see that trend developing.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America: Thanks, Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin from UBS. Your line is now open.
Stephen Chin – UBS: Hi, Rick. Have you seen a recovery in inspection equipment orders from the 300-millimeter semiconductor wafer dollars like SIMCO for instance and then the reason we ask this is do you think this would be another signal that the semi cap up cycle will likely continue?
Rick Wallace: There has been some increase. I would say that it was a long dry period for the wafer guys. I think pretty clearly they built in anticipation in the last cycle of gaining share and so there was an overcapacity that had to be – we had to catch up to. I think we've caught up to that. Mainly what I would say we have seen in the first part of this calendar year was associated with some technology and maybe market share wins among them and now what we're seeing is a broader level of commitment toward a capacity increases. So we think that's probably in the second half of the calendar year, but not robust, not at the levels certainly that it was at back in the last cycle, but that should – you know, I think they're being more cautious is the other part of that equation, but I think we'll see more demand as we go out into 2011.
Stephen Chin – UBS: All right. Thanks for that. And just one quick follow-up. When do you think orders from your new market segment will become more meaningful and which area in the new markets do you think can hit an in flexion point first?
Rick Wallace: We're forecasting about 9% of our business in the September quarter out of it and I think from my standpoint that's pretty meaningful for us and I think that if you look for an annualized run rate, if it's $250 million going up, that's pretty important and it's really pretty balanced. I mean, we do see from our standpoint, we see business in the back end in packaging which is new for us and a lot of change going on there. We see high brightness LED being a positive and we're a market leader in the solar space. So I think really the combination of those plus the work we do in storage are all contributing to our growth.
Stephen Chin – UBS: All right. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Hi. This is Casey [ph] calling for Mahesh. Couple of questions. In the last quarter, you folks had said the split between DRAM and NAND was about 50/50 and for the September quarter you're finding that this split is more like 75/25. Do you expect that ratio to maintain into December or do you find the December split would be something different?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. It's really hard to say. I mean these kind of come in projects – from our standpoint it's really not so much about the split in technology between NAND and DRAM for us, unlike for some process equipment companies I think it's more specific to which company is in which investment phase, but we do expect to see increased levels of NAND as we go forward based on some of the projects that are on the books that just happened to be NAND, but you're right that, you know, it's reasonably heavily DRAMs, at this point, we think those numbers will balance more as we go forward.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. If I could squeeze in one more question, does all this talk about, you know, giant fabs coming up in Taiwan and elsewhere, is that something that we should start now modeling for sometime in the first half of next year or is it something much later?
Rick Wallace: Hey Casey, let me just back up a second. I was looking at my notes here. You know, I'm looking at it; the NAND forecast for September is actually to be about two-thirds of the overall number for memory. I was looking at the wrong line here. So, you know, we are seeing that participation rate which makes more sense based on the projects that are out there. So I'm sorry about that, but I wanted to make sure I got that correction out there. And your second question again?
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Was, yeah, there is all this talk about giant foundries coming up in Taiwan and elsewhere. Is that something that we should start modeling into first half next year or is it something much later?
Rick Wallace: No. I think that’s – you know, those are work in progress. I think it's still pinned to the CapEx forecast for next year. We see some major foundries are increasing their overall level of commitment and new fab is going to be built in 2011. We probably won't see orders for those until late in the calendar year at the earliest I think, but there are build-outs of existing facilities before that.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Kim from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick, I know you don't give guidance for shipments, but could we expect shipments to increase as the pace of bookings has increased? Or do you think that the bookings were for longer lead time products that will ship over a longer period of time?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Actually, I’ll let Mark take that one.
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, the bookings will probably increase close to that same rate, but the reality is that with capacity constraints and so on and so forth they'll probably trail just a little bit in terms of the aggregate percentage increase in the booking order – excuse me, the shipment rate will probably trail it just a little bit, but our goal would be to catch that up over the next six months as we digest what amounted to sort of an extraordinary Q4.
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And with regard to mask inspection, I mean the bookings over the last couple of quarters have been at record pace I think and I was wondering if you could provide some color as to what's driving the demand for Reticle inspection right now and what percentage is (inaudible)
Rick Wallace: Right, so the overall demand for Reticle is driven by two things by two things; one I think that the most fundamental is we have a new product in the market that is gaining wide acceptance and that’s the Teron product line and I think a lot of the customers have been waiting to get their – to get to see that and a lot of times our Reticle inspection business once a new product comes out then it becomes a must have across the board and we see it both – often show up in that shops first, and then it will show up later depending on the fab lines, but we are also selling 5XX in the fab lines mostly now. And I think most of it has been oriented towards the (inaudible) guys at this point, some merchant business but probably a little bit more towards captive at this point.
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Great, thank you.
Rick Wallace: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer from Arete Research. Your line is now open.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Two questions, Rick. The first question is on your order guidance of 750 to 900 million I was just wondering given the tightness in the market why is there such a big range and is there anything, you know, like wildcard projects which might potentially come in the September quarter and as a follow up on the second question on the order book, I was just wondering is there anything that we need to read in your metrology numbers are pretty nicely up, is there any share gains? Can you talk about it? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Sure, Jagadish, good questions. The range guide – we try to put in what we think is reasonable. While it is true there's tightness out there, there is a lot of volatility and, of course, as I'm sure you know, we end up wanting to make sure that we optimize the business we have with our customers and so we don't want to tighten that range because you wouldn't want a particular customer to feel like they had additional leverage as to placing an order within the quarter. So we try to keep that range reflecting what we think as the normal volatility in the market. So I think that from that standpoint that kind of explains it. And the second question was on metrology. We did see some increase in share. We also saw penetration of metrology associated with increasing capacity and metrology perhaps is more directly aligned to some of the capacity buys and, you know, we've definitely benefited from that growth. Metrology is a market which has inherently a lot of growth because there's so many more materials that need to be measured and in the case of overlay there is a lots of litho challenges in the films may affect so that's why we think we saw that run up and we expect the metrology as a percent to actually see some more improvement as we go forward to September as a percent of our total order book.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick, at SEMICON West you mentioned the bookings in June could have been better. There were a few projects that moved into September and it sounds like many of those projects have come back. Just wanted to get some color –are those projects which segment are those projects, the foundry or memory or both?
Rick Wallace: Predominantly foundry. I mean it's predominantly foundry. There's some memory activity that ebbs and flows and we're seeing a lot of interest in memory and I think that we're in different conversations now with some of the memory guys who have gotten very serious about – but foundry definitely is where we saw a more significant snapback.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Got it. And then on the same subject, foundries, do you think there is a change in mindset with foundries this cycle? Clearly there is a lot of market share grab going on which is causing the foundries to spend more – as more new entrants like Global Foundries and then Samsung at this time around. So the question is I mean from an equipment point of view do you see a change in mindset that maybe the Tier 1 foundries are willing to run utilization at much lower levels, you know, maybe 80 to 85% on a normalized basis and kind of little bit lower utilization and settle on market share. Do you think there's been a change in dynamics in the foundry side?
Rick Wallace: I think there has probably been three changes. And I will tell you why I they are. One is the overall capital intensity, it is probably going up, but also they're supporting some of the IDMs that are out of the market. The second one is that because there is more opportunity I think you've got more players that are deep pocketed and are going after it and the last one I would say that the foundries in order to be competitive with – for their customers to be competitive have to be more on the leading edge. So there's more investment in newer technologies than perhaps in the last cycle. In terms of the utilization rate, you would have to ask the foundries, but clearly some people believe there's a trade-off between utilization rate and cycle time and in a market where you're running for market share, lower utilization will enable you in some cases, in some cases to have faster cycle time and be more responsive to customers. Does that make sense?
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Yes. Very helpful.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Lockwood, I turn the call back over to you.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you after our call.

With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. We are pleased with the company's performance in the March quarter, and as a result show KLA-Tencor successfully executing our strategic objectives in an improving industry environment. The new orders in March were $649 million, an increase of 26% compared with December, and above our range of guidance, a result of better than expected demand in our core markets and increased bookings from new markets. Third quarter revenue was $478 million, which was at the high end of guidance. With the combination of new product revenue and solid operations execution, we delivered strong margin performance in the quarter and non-GAAP EPS came in above the range of guidance at $0.41. We also grew our cash and investments to approximately $1.6 billion by quarter end, while repurchasing 2 million shares of common stock in the period. These numbers demonstrate the effectiveness of strategies we have been implementing since 2006 to extend our leadership in process control, access new growth markets and drive operational excellence. Mark will provide some greater detail on the much quarter in his comments that follows. Looking forward, we are very excited about the opportunity for more good news to come. Given the healthy investment cycle and the continued strong execution by the teams, we believe KLA-Tencor is positioned to deliver top line growth and profitability performance that will rival prior peaks of the company. I'd like to give you some perspective on how we aim to achieve this as it relates to our four strategic objectives. Our first strategic objective is customer focus. This really speaks to how we collaborate with our customers, how we drive innovation, and how we execute our product strategy. And we measure success and customer focus in terms of our market position, where our goal is to lead every market we serve. Today, we are the leader in nearly every one of our end markets, and our position in our core inspection and measurement markets remain strong as ever with our new bright field, dark field and radical inspection products enjoying strong acceptance in the marketplace. On top of continued strength in the core, we are making advances in markets where we have not traditionally been a leader. One example is the recent success of our new e-beam review tool, the eDR-5210. Our penetration in e-beam review markets strengthens our overall market position and helps drive adoption in the process control markets. By collaborating to anticipate our customers’ needs and executing, we are able to deliver the best tools for the market at the right time, which helps our customers maximize their ROI, and serves as an integral part of their business success. Our second strategic objective is growth. Our objective here is to drive growth over time in excess of the market, driven by increased process control adoption, diversification into new markets, and continued expansion of our services business. Regarding adoption, we see technical complexity at the leading edge driving an increasing need for process control. The industry research shows that adoption continues to be the peak in this cycle, and as the market leader we anticipate seeing our share of growth contributing to our top line. We also see our acquisition strategy now making an impact. Our approach for growth in new markets is to focus on extending KLA-Tencor’s technology and market leadership in to adjacent industries. We believe recent acquisitions have increased our available market by about 20%, adding new revenue opportunities to our business. Finally, we see services becoming increasingly more important as our installed base grows. Successful execution in our service business is first and foremost, defined by addressing our customers’ needs. We have over 22,000 tools in the field today. As the complexity of our tools increases and the breath of our services offerings continue to grow, the services we provide make an even better contribution to our customer success. When we evaluate our progress in our growth objectives, the data indicates we are successfully delivering on our targets. For example, the estimates show that those WFE, wafer front end expense recovering in 2010 to 20% to 30% of 2006 levels, which is when we first launched these strategies. We believe the success in our growth strategies and increased adoption in new markets has enabled KLA-Tencor to outperform this expected recovery in WFE. Our focus on diversification also helps buffer declines in a downturn. For example, when we look at calendar 2009, when WFE investments declined 46%, our revenue was down 35% in the year. Looking ahead in the cycle and beyond, we believe the continued strong execution in our growth objectives will fuel top line performance that could rival the prior peaks for KLA-Tencor. Our third objective is operational excellence. Successful execution here not only enables the resources to return value to shareholders, but also helps fuel investment in growth and innovation, which of course would drive future profitability. Execution in our operations focus is about decisively and effectively taking action to adjust to changing industry conditions, which we demonstrated in the recent downturn. Ongoing efforts related to this objective include our move to Singapore manufacturing, platform consolidation and programs, which are focused on streamlining our operations and supply chain. The March results showed our operational excellence focus bearing fruit, as evidenced by strong margin performance in the quarter, which exceeded our targets of 60% to 70% for incremental gross margins, and our targets for 50% to 60% for incremental operating margins. Long-term comparisons also demonstrate the strong leverage effect enabled in our model. Today we are supporting business levels that are not far from calendar year 2006, but on an operating cost structure that is 15% below 2006 levels. KLA-Tencor features a flexible business model that response well both in good times and bad. This is not by accident, but it is direct result of our market leadership and a continuing commitment to drive improved efficiencies in our global operations. And our fourth objective is talent. People are the key to our success at KLA-Tencor. Our recent accomplishments as well as our ability to achieve our future goals are only possible with the dedicated commitment of everyone in our workforce. So in conclusion, the March quarter results reflect a healthy demand environment, and shows the company is performing at a high level. We are well positioned with our customers with new products in the marketplace, our growth strategies are delivering results, and we're delivering increased leverage in our business model. We have great deal of optimism as we look forward. We think we are well positioned for even stronger results as we move through the cycle. Turning now to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we expect this momentum to continue with gross bookings in June projected up 5% to 25% compared with March, revenue expected in the range of $530 million to $570 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.54 to $0.62. With that I will turn the call over to Mark for his review of the numbers. Mark.
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats. One under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes acquisition and write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain cost and expenses which are outside of our core operations, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will reference our non-GAAP income statement, but where I reference GAAP numbers will make the distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our web site. Revenue for Q3 was $478 million at the high end of our guided range of $450 to $480 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.41. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.33. A summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are as follows. Acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes, restructuring and severance charges of $4 million before taxes or $0.01 per share after taxes, and stock option litigation expenses of $5 million pretax or $0.02 per share after taxes. We also recorded a non-cash tax charge of about $3 million associated with the cumulative shortfall position in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added $0.02 per share to non-GAAP earnings. The recent improvement in order activity continued in Q3. New orders for the March quarter were $649 million, an increase of 26% over Q2 new orders of $516 million. We also scheduled in about $10 million of orders received in prior quarters resulting in net orders of $659 million, up about 20% from Q2. We added $180 million to our backlog in Q3, and ended the quarter with $939 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at March 31 included $280 million of revenue backlog, for products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue, and $659 million in system orders that have not yet shipped. Most of the backlog typically ships over the following six months. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows, the U.S. was 23% of new system orders in Q3, up from 16% in the December quarter; Europe was 3% of new systems orders, down from 4% in Q2; Japan was 10%, down from 14% last quarter; Korea was 15%, down from 19% last quarter; Taiwan was 39%, up from 33% last quarter and the rest of Asia was 9%, down from 14% in Q2. The Q3 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 48%, up from 42% last quarter. Radical inspection was 15%, even with last quarter, metrology was 10%, down from 13% in the prior quarter and solar storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 8% compared to 6% last quarter. Services was 19% of new orders in Q3, down from 24% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 50% of the semiconductor systems orders in Q3 versus 59% in Q2. Logic customers were 13% of systems orders in Q3 versus 24% in Q2, and memory system orders rose to 37% in Q3 compared with 17% in Q2. Technology purchases generated most of the activity this quarter, with 45-nanometer and below development pilot activity, comprising 93% of the semiconductor systems orders, versus 95% in Q2. Orders for 32-nanometer and below were 43% of semiconductor orders received in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect that new orders in Q4 will increase between 5% and 25% over Q3 new orders for a range of about $680 million to $810 million. Shipments in Q3, which include both systems shipments and services revenue, were $515 million, up 12% from $459 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q3 was up 11% to $350 million compared with $315 million in Q2. Services revenue was $128 million in Q3, up 2% from $125 million in Q2. Our expectations for total revenue in Q4 is a range between $530 and $570 million, and we expect services to contribute about 25% of the total. Non-GAAP gross margin was 58% in the March quarter, up three percentage points from December. The improved gross margin percentage in Q3 was better than our incremental target of 60% to 70%, because of favorable product mix and lower excess and obsolete reserve requirements. For Q4, we are modeling an incremental gross margin target roughly equal to our stated goal of 60% to 70%. Operating expenses were $167 million, an increase of $3 million from the December quarter. R&D was $84 million, a $2 million increase from Q2. Selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A were $83 million this quarter, up $1 million from last quarter. The primary reason for the operating expense increase was a higher accrual rate for variable pay based upon our updated full-year projections for operating profit. These higher accruals resulted in about $4 million in additional operating expenses this quarter. Without the additional accruals, operating expenses would have been about $163 million or down $1 million versus Q2. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $11 million expense in Q3 or approximately $2 million higher than the $9 million we recorded in Q2. The Q3 increase in OIE was essentially attributable to a write-down of two investments in our KT Ventures portfolio. In Q4, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $9 to $10 million. In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $27 million or 27% of pretax income versus $18 million in Q2, which was also 27% of pretax income. Our GAAP tax rate in Q3 was 29%, down considerably from 43% in Q2, mostly because of lower non-cash charges resulting from how accounting rules are applied to cumulative shortfalls in our employee stock activity. Non-GAAP net income was $71 million or $0.41 per share in Q3. These numbers include pretax stock-based compensation expenses of $21 million. And our model tax rate of 30%, our Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.39. At the revenue range I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q4 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.54 and $0.62 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q3 were $173.4 million versus $173.8 million in Q2. During Q3, we also started our stock repurchase program, and spent $55 million buying back about 2 million shares. As of March 31, we had 7.8 million shares available under our current repurchase authorization, and we anticipate some repurchase activity in the June quarter. For guidance purposes, we are modeling an average share count of 172 million for Q4. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at about $1.6 billion, about even with the prior quarter end. Cash generated from operations was $128 million in Q3 compared with 164 million in Q2, which included a tax refund of $72 million. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $323 million, up from $298 million at December 31, mostly because of higher shipments. DSOs were 61 days at March 31 versus 62 days at the end of December. Both DSO figures are net of allowance for uncollectible accounts and factors. Net inventories increased by $22 million from last quarter and ended the quarter at $374 million, inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues was 2.3 turns in Q3, down slightly from 2.4 turns last quarter. Net capital expenditures were $10 million in Q3 versus $11 million in Q2. Total headcount ended the quarter at 4,873, up slightly from 4850 at December 31. We expect our headcount will increase slightly during Q4, especially in our manufacturing locations as we adjust our capacity in response to the recent demand increase. During Q3, we entered into a proposed settlement of the Federal derivative shareholder suit stemming from our historical stock option granting practices, and we reached proposed settlements with two former KLA executives, which will resolve their claims against us. The proposed settlement is scheduled to be heard for final approval on May 24. When the settlements are approved by the court, they will result in KLA making cash payments of approximately $27 million, and issuing about $8 million in KLA stock. We also expect to receive cash proceeds of about $33 million, mostly from our insurance carriers as a result of resolving these matters. While we can't predict the exact timing of the payments and receipts associated with these settlements until they become effective, resolution of these matters should significantly reduce or eliminate KLA’s ongoing cost of the stock option related litigation after Q4. Overall, we're very happy with how Q3 unfolded. Net systems orders were the best we have seen in 11 quarters. The increased production volumes have allowed us to take advantage of the lower cost manufacturing location moves we have made over the last three years, and we are very happy at the prospect of getting most of the options related litigation behind us. In summary, our guidance for Q4 is new orders are expected to increase by 5% to 25% over Q3 new orders, total revenue between $530 million and $570 million, non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.54 to $0.62 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Mark. We are now happy to take your questions, and once again we request that each participant please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get as many callers as possible in the time allotted today, and with that operator we are ready for our first question.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
CJ Muse – Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question on the gross margin line, the 58% was pretty phenomenal at the 478 revenue level. I think the last time you did that was around 635 million. So I guess the question is, what does the trajectory look like from here, is there further savings in the move to Singapore, and I guess target wise are we still looking at 60% around the 650 million level, or could that be even lower?
Mark Dentinger: Yes, CJ. Hi, this is Mark. The answer is we are probably getting as much as we had originally expected out of the moves to Singapore and our lower cost manufacturing locations. We are not completely at full capacity yet, but we are certainly starting to get there, and that is part of the contribution. I also noted in my prepared remarks that we are getting some benefit from the mix of very high margin products in the performance that we just posted for this quarter. And we still think that our long-term trajectory from here is 60 to 70 incremental points of margin improvement with each additional dollar of revenue. So most of what we have done in terms of preparing for this upturn is coming to pass in terms of our cost savings, and I would say that we're putting a lot of operational focus on just making sure that we are running as lean an operation as possible. So all of that has turned in our favor, and we are seeing the benefits in the line. I would say we are still on our long-term growth trajectory of 60 to 70 incremental gross margin target.
CJ Muse – Barclays Capital: Good. And I guess as my follow-up, your overall backlog grew 24% sequentially, and I guess the question here is are you still planning to manage to roughly 6 months backlog, and I guess does that change higher or lower as you think about continued strength in bookings? And I guess what does that mean for revenues in the second half, it would suggest to me a very nice up tick.
Mark Dentinger: Yes, we still have a target to manage to 6 months in the backlog, and what we are currently doing right now is producing at pretty high rate and shipping everything we can. It does bode well for the second half in terms of our revenue performance, because as you said that with all of the strong bookings performance right now, we will have some catch-up period of time before it drops to the revenue line. So, all of that is a pretty good story.
CJ Muse – Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Hi, this is Kate Kotlarsky for Jim Covello. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color in your memory orders during the quarter. It looks like there has been some increased activity there, and I was hoping you could break it down for us between NAND and DRAM, and then maybe comment on whether the composition of Q2 orders were – whether you are starting to now see some capacity buying in there as you had mentioned that Q1, there was a lot of technology buying still? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Hi, Kate. Yes, thanks for the question. You know, the March quarter played out pretty much the way we had forecast. Memory did pick up. We saw 37% of our orders coming from memory, and that was prominently in the DRAM space. So 74% of that was DRAM, 24% was NAND. We look forward – we figure June is about the same as a percentage. So, we are modeling about 36%, but we think probably closer to 50-50 in terms of composition between DRAM and NAND. And what we are seeing to your question is we are definitely seeing some capacity buys happening in addition to the technology. So this is what we had been outlining for a few quarters as we thought that first we would see technology and then we will see the ramping on the other side, on the capacity, and that is kind of how it is playing out right now.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: And just as a follow-up on that, in terms of the capacity buying that you are seeing, is it sort of distributed among the number of customer or is it concentrated between 1 or 2 customers?
Rick Wallace: No, it is pretty widespread and as we model going forward we see broadening, and we see some new projects coming on line later in the calendar year as well. So definitely seeing that across a number of customers.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then maybe one final question, on the gross margin front you had alluded to the fact that there was some help from mix during the quarter. Is there anything that is driving that shift to higher margin systems that you are seeing?
Mark Dentinger:
 :
Rick Wallace: And actually much of our performance on margins is associated with our internal efforts towards cost reduction and management. You know, we continue to earn good pricing from our customers, but heavily focused on streamlining operations. And we put a lot of hard work into that over the years, and now we are seeing that bear fruit.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Hi guys, thanks. Two things, Rick there is some talk out there of some sort of more challenged, you know, competitive atmosphere for you, particularly in Korea, and so I was wondering what your take is on the competitive front, and then I had a follow up, thanks.
Rick Wallace: Yes, Tim, as you know we always face competition, and I think if you look back the stories of the last couple of years, and I think our competitive position has held up quite well, and our market share is up. And we face competitors everywhere around the globe and I don't think that is likely to change. So we got to keep doing what we do, which is bring out new products to that market’s ability and work closely with customers. I'm pretty comfortable with our strategy there.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Okay, and now I guess there is obviously a pretty hot debate out there about what happens in the back half of the year. You know, if you sort of do some run rate work and you look at the bookings and the shipments, we are pretty much within a very close shouting distance of what the peak was last cycle on kind of a run rate basis for wafer fab equipment, certainly for some types of equipment. So I'm sort of wondering what you think in terms of what the environment holds from kind of back half versus front half. I think most companies would have thought that there was a pull-back in the back half, but I guess recently some companies have been a bit more positive about the back half. So I'm sort of wondering what your sense is second half versus first half?
Rick Wallace: Tim, it is a great question. You know, I think for us, we have a lot of runway, because of a couple of things. One is, while our overall bookings look very strong and the bookings guidance for June looks very strong, you know 8% of that is non-semi, our services has grown. So, when we look at the actual businesses that we had in the last upturn, our complexion is different. And so we actually think there is more opportunity, and we talk to a lot of customers about new projects. So even if the core semi stuff cools off, we think we have got the ability to continue to grow, and as you are seeing in our operational performance, gross margin and bottom-line, it is not dilutive to our model. In fact, what we see is we are putting up better numbers than we did at the same point in the cycle. So I think we are not the same as the other players in this space.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: And I guess just one more quick thing, if I just look at your systems revenue, if I actually strip out services, there has been quite a bit of compression there. So you are keeping up with wafer fab equipment, but it is mostly because of services. So, it seems like there is some sort of compression on kind of a relative basis in the systems revenue, and I'm wondering why that is. Is that the result of you exciting some products versus back then or some pricing pressure, why might that be?
Rick Wallace: No, I think there is a couple of things. One is as we did – that were some product lines that we traded out of, but I also think if you look at our June guide for bookings, and if you look at the backlog we have been building, our profile is different. I don't know who else is guiding plus 5 to plus 25 for June on bookings. And as you know our revenue is coming in significantly below, which means we are building backlog. So I think if you do the math, you model that out for the rest of the year, I don't think you see the compression.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Rick, when I look at it with all the new fabs coming online may be later this year or next year, when do you think you are going to start seeing significant orders for these new fabs and new shows come and hit you guys.
Rick Wallace: There certainly are new fabs, and I think some of the timing has been – it is fun to say that, right. There are new fabs. We haven't said that in a while. There are various timings for those that we are in conversations, and I think this is – if anything that is the best part of the story for second half, as some of those new fabs start ordering in the summertime and into the fall. So we do have new projects out there in addition to the expansions of the existing ones. So, I think the timing, we're having conversations with those folks right now, and if anything what is interesting is the momentum towards we are trying to pull in some plans that had been later in 2011, now there is desire to get it done sooner.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America: All right. And to follow up on the competitive question, is it fair to assume besides the normal competitive posturing that happens between you guys and others, is there more activity happening among your competitors versus between you and your competition, is it fair enough to assume, or do you think there is nothing that has changed in the last 4 to 6 months?
Rick Wallace: Well, I think in the last couple of years there is definitely a change in the mix of competitors. And you have seen some competitors exit the market, and I think that that has changed the position, but you know, you don't have to do a lot of math to figure out that they are doing quite well relative to the rest of the space. Our gross margin indicates that we are getting good pricing and we are also doing a good job on cost. So our competitive position continuous to be very strong and I do think that we will never ever have 100% market share in any of these markets. And so as a result, there is going to be mix on the other end of some of those markets and I think those competitors will come and go, but if we play our – but if we continue to execute on our strategy, we will continue to be in a strong position.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America: And just a final follow-up, did you say anything on the shipment guidance for June? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Yes, we don't guide shipments forward anymore. We will fully disclose the shipments that we had in the current quarter, but we don't have any guidance on shipments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with CSFB. Your line is open.
Satya Kumar – CSFB: Yes, hi, thank you. Very good quarter guys, just wanted to touch upon the foundry exposure a little bit, are foundries pretty much holding that same 50% level in June?
Rick Wallace: That is how we are modeling them, correct.
Satya Kumar – CSFB: All right. Some of your big foundry customers have recently talked about defect densities improving significantly at 40 nm, I was wondering if that could potentially cause a pause in buying from this sector, or do you actually – are you starting to see activity at maybe the 28 node that is starting to come in as well?
Rick Wallace: No, we are definitely seeing a push, and the other thing that is happening in terms of next generation, but the other thing that is happening is there are multiple foundries in play right now. So, you know, a year ago we would have said it was pretty isolated, and now it is much broader. So there is a bit of a challenge out there for multiple companies and multiple fabs to execute on 40. The other thing you see is when they are hitting defect densities, you look at the volume and it is pretty small. So what we are talking about is a relatively early part of the manufacturing ramp on the advance design rules and a recognition that in order to maintain those defect densities as they ramp, they got to have more coverage from inspection and measurement. So I like to think of that we are helping contribute to the fact that people are driving down their densities. They are seeing the value and they will expand out as they ramp on those nodes. Because many of the tool sets out there just weren’t capable of handling broad-based 40 nm production.
Satya Kumar – CSFB: All right. And in terms of the NAND orders that you are seeing in June, that is pretty much doubling from March levels, could you talk about concentration of that NAND orders, is there any projects in there that surprised you in terms of size, in terms of how much capacity is coming on?
Rick Wallace: I wouldn't say surprised, as you know, if anything we have been working quite a while with our customers in terms of their you know, basically understanding their needs and positioning our products. We are starting to see just increased activity overall in terms of people wanting to ramp. And so you know, the surprise if there was one, was just that we’re finally getting to the point, where people are letting loose their capital budgets for inspection metrology, and we are pretty well positioned to handle that right now.
Satya Kumar – CSFB: Good and one quick follow-up. How much would this reduction in litigation expense lower the OpEx, all else being the same in September?
Mark Dentinger: Well, if you just look at the non-GAAP OpEx, we already stripped the litigation cost out, but we've been running an ongoing rate in terms of our GAAP numbers of somewhere between $3 million and $5 million a quarter. So we should begin to see that relief beginning in the next fiscal year.
Satya Kumar – CSFB: Got it, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, a nice quarter. Rick, you mentioned that there are multiple that are ordering in the June quarter, and I presume some of them are tier 2 foundries. So I just want to get a sense of the confidence level of orders actually do coming through from some of these foundries, especially in China, and historically speaking these foundries have made decision sometimes to move forward with the fabs, but never come through. So I just want to get a sense on the confidence level of tier 2 foundry spending.
Rick Wallace: Well, there are a couple, I guess questions and assumptions in there, Atif, one is that you know, geographically where they're coming from. Let me say that we are very confident in the order books that we've got based on the customer conversations that we've had and the, you know, our understanding of their capital budgets and their procurement cycle and as you know, we are very conservative in terms of how we allocate credit to customers and we’re pretty confident that they’re very solid.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: I understand. And then a quick follow up, the guidance, historically you have some seasonality in the June quarter, some you haven't had that seasonality, is there any seasonal element to the services business that is making the quarter guidance look stronger?
Rick Wallace: Well, we have had seasonality in the past. It's not in the services business and it you know, tend to coincide – tended to coincide with our fiscal year end. I don't know after the last year, you know, how much we were reverting to historical practices. What we do see is that there is a strong demand out there, and that's why we guided up and then it's based on our conversations. The second half of the year has uniqueness to it as we discussed earlier in this call and that there are new fabs that are actually being built and coming online. So, I think it's early for us to forecast out what the second half looks like, but certainly from where we sit June looks very good, but I don’t think it is as much about seasonality as it is just increased confidence at our customers that now is the time for them to invest.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Okay, and one last one, the non-semi business, which one is looking the best among ACD and high brightness LED, solar, you know, which one is looking the best?
Rick Wallace: You know, it's really a mix. We've – I've been delighted with the performance that we have outside the core, and these are some bets we placed in the downturn and there are a couple of quarters where we are looking around, wondering what we're thinking, but now they've come back and we've seen solar pick up, high brightness LED, you know, even hard disk drive. We are seeing investment happening there, and as we’ve said these businesses, the way we structure them and integrate them into KT, they support our overall business model. So we're pleased with that as well. We also have backend packaging, which wasn't historically in our model and we're seeing great success back there too. So it's really a blend of all of those.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Rick, can you talk a little bit about inspection, intensity and memory, I think previously you’ve acknowledged that it's obviously a bit lower than it is in the foundry space, and I think you’ve said you have to prove your case there a little bit. Should we assume that that begins to pick up in the relative short-term or is that a longer-term process before we start seeing that?
Rick Wallace: Yes, on the last call Raj, exactly right. I said that we needed to show it and you know, I like to think that in the March quarter we demonstrated some of that. We have some evidence now with the increase that we had, and I think it's an unfolding story. You know, the combination of customers have to feel the need and I think they've got the need and then they've got to be convinced that our products actually will support them, and we're showing evidence of that now. So as we guide forward, you know, we guided overall bookings up and we guided memory to be basically as a percentage of our overall bookings flat, which says we assume we're going to continue to see growth on the memory side and this time it will split between DRAM and NAND. So, I think it's working. We continue to be in there every day with our customers trying to demonstrate that value, but it's work in progress.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: And do you think that – is that an easier case for you to make as people start adding capacity on some of the new nodes, where they have been moving and may have been able to, I don't know use other techniques or whatever to get to their objectives, is that facilitated by just simply more volume, or do we just need more strength and more time?
Rick Wallace: No, more it's been facilitated by new products from us. I mean, the most important thing getting our new products into the customers hands, and them seeing what they were missing, and in a lot of cases that’s been the challenge because without one of the advanced tools, ours are you know, competing with either an old tool that we had or somebody else’s. They didn't necessarily know what they we're missing. So we've got to get the tools in there and then they start seeing results and then we've seen a remarkable increase in – I was in Asia a couple of weeks ago and the conversations were about how do we get our tools into their factories faster to support their memory ramps, which is a very nice conversation to be having except we then have to get our tools in there faster, which is a challenge.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: Yes, and Mark just a quick one for you, any thoughts on your capital structure, obviously it changed several years ago with your predecessor, do you think this is the right kind of capital structure or hypothetical is there a different model over time that you like to move to? Thanks.
Mark Dentinger: Yes, we are – certainly with the upturn and sort of having flown through the crisis period Raj, this is not a bad time to be thinking it through. We are having discussions. We are certainly not in a hurry to do anything rash right away, but I certainly think from the debt leverage perspective, we're happy with this right now. I would like to see a little bit better prospects of inflation going forward before we would you know, sort of think it through differently, but as it is right now, we’re reasonably satisfied with the basic capital structure and as we noted earlier in the call, we did restart the buyback program early this quarter, which is a confidence that you know, we’ve stabilized.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: Yes, great, thanks. Nice quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Hi guys. This is Casey [ph] calling in for Mahesh. A couple of quick questions, you talked a bit about the shipments into 4 X and the 3 X nodes. Could you give some color on the timing of shipments and orders into the 2X node?
Rick Wallace: Well, you know, we're seeing some activity in 2 X as you might imagine now there's been development even for some time in R&D. And so I think it really is very customer dependent on when they're going towards 2 X, and as you know, technology dependent when the NAND guys will get there first, and then we’ll see the DRAM guys follow and some of the logic guys, but there is certainly R&D spend but as a percent of our overall order book, the 2 X is very small right now and I'd say that that is going to remain a small percentage of our business for the next several quarters.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. In the memory space, you said that the DRAM versus NAND is going to be about 50% of your orders in June. Going forward, would you expect that ratio to continue, or would you expect NAND to sort of dominate the memory span?
Rick Wallace: I think it goes to some of the projects overall that we’re talking about that are out there. You know, if you look at the projects that are being contemplated, there are a few NAND projects that are obviously going to influence that as we go forward. So assuming they'd go ahead, then you would see NAND pickup, and I guess the question will be what will the DRAM guys do in conjunction, but we certainly see you know, growth on the NAND space. NAND is as you know, dependent on a lot of external factors right now and so I think it's early to call that one.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Okay and last question. What would you think is the approximate timing, as far as you can see, for orders from tier two and tier three DRAM players?
Rick Wallace: Yes, it's a great question. I don't know. I think it depends on you know, how well the memory markets hold up in terms of the pricing, and right now pricing has been obviously much more encouraging. So I think they are increasing their conviction. So, you know, that's probably the second half of the year kind of story.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, sounds good.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chin with UBS. Your line is open.
Steven Chin – UBS: Thanks. Hi Rick and Mark, nice quarter also. Just a follow up question on the improvement in memory customer orders that you're seeing. Do you get the sense there could be another step function increase in orders from perhaps the DRAM companies, Rick, when they eventually get to the 40-nanometer node in volume, because it looks like that's when your foundry customers really ramped inspection orders at the 40-nanometer node with KLA over the past year. Is that kind of your sense?
Rick Wallace: My sense is that they're going to run into increasing challenges as they ramp, and I think they are seeing that. As I said, I think earlier in this call our burden, our challenge is to demonstrate the value of our products and to have them realize those ROIs. We think we've got the right products, we think we've got the right teams in place to do that, but it's very much a show me story right now. We've got to demonstrate the values and our customers have to recognize that and follow through. We just simply did not anticipate the reaction in the foundry space. So as much as we had predicted increase in intensity of inspection and measurement, we guess low on that and I think it's very possible that we are modeling low right now and the memory, but it is incumbent on us to show the value, and that's what you know, our teams are working on every day.
Steven Chin – UBS: Okay. And then just a follow-up question about the number of new fabs that you're seeing built out there. Did you get the sense that KLA's order opportunity is stronger during the years when there are more new factory builds, especially since you've got a larger product offering in the sub-cycle?
Rick Wallace: Yes, in general, I mean, our footprint is bigger and so you know, we're dependent on two things, as you know we're dependent on technology and we're dependent on capacity, and we tend to do pretty well in technology. What’s interesting about the new facet is of course they are above, right. They're looking at ramping on new technologies, new fabs, and so I think that that's very encouraging. Where we have had less success in the past is that somebody wasn't ramping on an older technology but that's not going to be the case in these new fabs. So I think given our product breath, and given our positioning, we do have tremendous opportunity and it's a matter of executing.
Steven Chin – UBS: Okay, thanks Rick. Nice quarter again.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with Arete Research. Your line is open.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick. First question is that if you look at 2008 in terms of your logic bookings, you had substantial bookings from the logic customers. How should we think about logic bookings as you progress through 2010 please?
Rick Wallace: Yes, you know, we're forecasting logic to kind of hang in there roughly where we were this last quarter. For the June quarter we were at 13% and we go up to 14% and it's not so much a function that logic isn't investing. It's just the other segments that are increasing pretty significantly. So even with that we see increase in logic. You know, if we look to the second half there are some projects out there that look encouraging, but they just aren't the same number of new fabs coming online and there is not as much anticipated overall investment and the logic guys have just been more steady throughout the course of the cycle as they have been historically. So I'd say we see good opportunity there but it's not the primary growth.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Okay, the second question is, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about your e-beam review product getting considerable traction. Can you give us some more color on what is driving that product traction, please?
Rick Wallace: Yes, I think there is a couple of things, one and probably most important is our most advanced inspectors find defects that there is really no other way to review then with our most advanced e-beam review product. So as we sell inspectors, as we sell new inspectors, our customers are realizing that the new review capability that we have is enabling them to identify clearly the defects that we're catching, so that they can go, take corrective action, and they really can't do that with any other equipment on the market. So that's been a tremendous value to our customers, and that's really driving it. I think the other thing that overall of course is the general pickup in market is driving more e-beam review in general, but competitively we've got a product that works extremely well with our inspectors, which is where most of the market is with our inspectors.
Jagadish Iyer – Arete Research: Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ed Lockwood, I will turn the call back over to you.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you through the course of the quarter and that concludes our call.

With that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings call. In my remarks today, I will discuss the financial highlights and the demand environment in the December quarter, provide some perspective on our industry outlook for calendar 2010 and provide guidance for the quarter. Mark Dentinger will then take you for the details of the December quarter result and will conclude with your questions. Let’s get started. We are pleased with the company's second quarter performance as the combination of strengthening industry dynamics, strong demand for new products and good execution contributed to solid results for KLA-Tencor. Second quarter revenue was $440 million, an increase of 28% compared with September. Non-GAAP net income was $49 million, up 88% sequentially and non-GAAP net income per share, including stock-based compensation, but excluding some one-time charges was $0.28 in the quarter. In addition to strong revenue growth and profit performance, we also generated $164 million in operating cash flow in the period and our cash position grew to $1.5 billion at quarter end. So by any of these measures, a very good result for KLA-Tencor in the December quarter. As we look into calendar 2010, we see the semiconductor equipment market place on solid footing and progressing steadily in what the analysts projected the healthy cyclical recovery for the industry. This is driven by solid IC growth and a favorable supply and demand balance and high fab utilization. Current consensus for the semiconductor revenue percentage growth in the mid-teens range in 2010. And the market analysts are forecasting capital expenditure to increase in the range of 50 to 60% for the year with investment focused primarily on advanced technology development. We expect process control will be a key enabler of our customers' success in this period of technology focused capital and investment. This is because our customers execute their investment strategies to drive down costs and achieve better device performance. Each successive generation of new technology is characterized by increased process complexity, shorter market windows and more challenging yield requirements. Process controls on the critical path for successful management of these complex technical challenges enabling our customers to quickly ramp new processes, get them into production and then maintain high yields in order to drive cost efficiencies and meet their time to market goals. As the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is positioned to benefit from higher adoption of inspection and management and to achieve our goal of growth in excess of the industry. Now, turning to some specific of KLA-Tencor's performance. Gross bookings in Q2 were $516 million, an increase of 5% compared with September and we delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of order growth off our December 2008 low. Demand was characterized by sustained high levels of investment from foundry, increasing strength in memory and continued technology investment and logic. Orders were focused primarily on advanced technology development with some capacity investment at the advanced nodes. Foundries were 59% of system orders in Q2. The continued challenges in achieving 4X nanometer yield targets increased demand and fabulous customers and heightened competition are driving foundry capital intensive to levels not seen in recent years. We expect this trend to continue and to benefit KLA-Tencor as our foundry customers are typically adopters of process control. With market leaders forecasting higher levels of capital spending in calendar 2010 and appears the investment cycle in foundry is poised to continue. Memory grew sequential in the December quarter to 17% of orders. And our near-term forecast show memory orders on an upward trajectory with demand primarily focused on technology buys. Memory customers are facing increased technical challenges as they develop advanced technologies, such as DDR3 for DRAM and 3X nanometer in NAND. The increased complexity associated with introducing new architectures and materials in advanced memory devices is driving more inspection of metrology steps in the manufacturing process. We believe memory customers are progressing along the same path as did the foundries early in the development stage of 4X nanometer. We anticipate as memory customers ramp their processes over the next few quarters, they too will encounter additional yield challenges driving an increased need for inspection and measurement to ramp their yields, to meet tight market windows leading to additional business for KLA-Tencor. Logic was up sequential in Q2 to 24% of bookings as this market continues to ramp 3X nanometer technology. We look ahead to 2010 with a great deal of excitement. We have new products in place dressing both our core semiconductor and emerging markets such as the High-Brightness LED Market. We are well positioned with our customers and our adoption story is playing out very well in the early stages of this cycle. Our expectation is for process control adoption to continue to grow, as customers in each of our semiconductor end markets faced increasing challenges at the leading edge. From a business model perspective, our relentless focus on operational excellence continues to differentiate KLA-Tencor and provides resources to fuel our investments in growth. With the benefit of the actions we have taken throughout the past several years and particularly in response to the recent industry downturn and world economic crisis, we are positioned to deliver higher profitability than we have had at comparable revenue levels in the past. Driving improved operational leverage remains a key focus of the management team and we're committed to translating our strong business returns into increased shareholder value, as we progressed through the growth stage of this cycle. Now, I would like to give my perspective on guidance for the March quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the prevailing view for the calendar 2010 is for the semiconductor equipment demand to grow in the range of 50 to 60%, driven largely by catch-up [ph] technology spending for memory customers, after a period of under investment and continued high capital intensity in foundry. In addition, with spending primarily focused on advancing Moore's Law and the increased technical complexity at the advanced nodes driving new yield challenges and resulting in higher adoption of process control, we see 2010 shaping up to be a very strong year for our industry and for KLA-Tencor. In terms of our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, we expect orders to be in March to be up flat to up 20%, compared with December, revenues are expected to be between $450 million and $480 million with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.31 to $0.37. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. As a reminder, we present our income statement in two formats. One under U.S. GAAP and another in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-downs of intangible assets associated acquisitions. Expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain cost and expenses which we do not expect to be recurring, such as restructuring charges and unusual tax items. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will reference our non-GAAP income statement, but where I reference GAAP numbers will make the distinction. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP statement is attached to our press release and available on our web site. Revenue for Q2 was $440 million slightly towards the high end of our guided range of $420 to $450 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.28. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.13. A summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are as follows. Acquisition-related charges of $8 million before taxes or $0.03 per share after taxes, restructuring and severance charges of $14 million before taxes or $0.05 per share after taxes, stock option litigation expenses of $7 million pretax or $0.02 per share after taxes. We also recorded a non-cash tax charge of about $9 million associated with the cumulative shortfall acquisition in our employee stock activity. Removing this charge from GAAP earnings added $0.05 per share to non-GAAP EPS. The recent improvement in order activity continued in Q2 with foundry orders generating the largest portion of new business. New orders for Q2 were $516 million, an increase of 5% over Q1 new orders. We also scheduled then about $33 million of orders received in prior quarters resulting in net orders of $549 million, up about 15% from Q1. To clarify the new versus net order phenomenon, older orders tend to be delayed or scheduled out of our 12-month delivery window, during downturns resulting in new orders that exceed net. Conversely old orders tend to be scheduled in during upturns and as a result, net will exceed new. We added over $110 million to our backlog in Q2 and ended the quarter with $759 million in total systems backlog. The backlog at December 31 included $245 million of revenue backlog, for products that had been shipped and invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue and $514 million in systems orders that have not yet shipped. Most of the backlog typically ships over the following six months. The regional distribution of new systems orders in the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows, the U.S. was 16% of new system orders in Q1, up from 13% in the September quarter; Europe was 4% of new systems orders, up from 3% in Q1; Japan was 14%, up from 9% last quarter; Korea was 19%, up from 6% last quarter; Taiwan was 33%, down from 51% last quarter and the rest of Asia was 14%, down from 18% Q1. The Q2 distribution of new systems and services orders by product family and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows: wafer inspection was 42%, up from 32% last quarter. Radical inspection was 15%, down from 22% last quarter, metrology was 13%, down from 17% in the prior quarter and solar storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was 6% compared to 7% last quarter. Services was 24% of new orders in Q2, up from 22% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 59% of semiconductor systems orders in Q2 versus 76% in Q1. Logic and memory orders were 24% and 17% in Q2 versus 11% and 13% in Q1 respectively. Technology purchases generated most of the activity this quarter, with 45-nanometer and below developed pilot activity, comprising 95% of the semiconductor systems orders, the same percentage we experienced in Q1. Looking forward, we are assuming new orders in Q2 within a range of flat to up 20% from Q2. Shipments in Q2, which include both systems shipments and services revenue were $459 million, up 20% from $383 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q2 was up 38% to $315 million versus $229 million in Q1. Services revenue was $125 million in Q2, up 11% from $113 million in Q1. Our expectations for total revenue in Q3 is a range between $450 and $480 million and we expect services to contribute a little less than 30% of the total. Non-GAAP margin was 55% in December, up three percentage points from September. The improved margin percentage in Q2 was consistent with our stated margin leverage targets and we expect the gross margin percentage will continue to improve in Q3 as well. Operating expenses were $164 million, an increase of $11 million from the September quarter. R&D was $82 million, $4 million increase from Q1. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A were also $82 million this quarter, a $7 million increase from last quarter. Primary reason for the operating expense increase was a higher accrual rate for variable pay based upon our updated full-year projections for operating profit. These higher accruals resulted in $8 million in additional operating expense this quarter. Without the additional accruals, operating expenses would have been about $156 million or up $3 million versus Q1. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $9 million expense in Q2 or approximately $17 million lower than our Q1 net credit of $8 million. The Q1 net credit largely resulted from a non-recurring $16 million gain from reversing a consumption tax contingency. Without this credit, Q1 OIE would have been a net expense of $8 million. In Q3, we expect OIE to be approximately $8 to $10 million. In Q2, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $18 million or 27% of pretax income versus $6 million in Q1 or 17% of pretax income. The rate increase in Q2 is largely because we had non-taxable investment gains in our deferred compensation plan in Q1. Our GAAP tax percentage rose considerably from Q1 as a result of a non-cash component that added $9 million in additional tax expense in Q2. This additional expense results from how accounting rules are applied to cumulative shortfalls and our employee stock activity and will be more fully described in our 10-Q for this quarter. Because its expense is non-cash and nonmaterial and materializes only when a company is in a cumulative shortfall position, we removed it in preparing our non-GAAP income. Non-GAAP net income was $49 million or $0.28 per share in Q2. These numbers include pretax stock-based compensation expenses of $21 million. And our model tax rate of 30%, our Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.27. At the revenue range, I previously mentioned, we would expect our Q3 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.31 and $0.37 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. The weighted average share is used to compute EPS in Q2 was $173.8 million versus 173 million in Q1. For the March quarter, our average share count should be approximately $175 million, assuming we do not repurchase shares. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.5 billion, an increase of $135 million quarter to quarter. Cash generated from operations was $164 million in Q2 and included a U.S. federal tax refund of about $72 million. Excluding the tax refund, our cash both from operations would have been about 92 million in Q2 compared with $73 million in Q1. In Q3, our cash flow from operations likely decreased because we won't be receiving a tax refund. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $298 million, up from $244 million at September 30th, mostly because of higher shipments. DSOs were 62 days at December 31 versus 66 days at the end of September. Net inventories increased by $5 million from last quarter and end the quarter at $352 million, but inventory turnover based upon GAAP cost of revenues improved from 1.9 turns last quarter to 2.4 turns this quarter because of higher volumes. Net capital expenditures were $11 million in Q2 versus $4 million in Q1, a significant portion of the Q2 capital spending increase related to the Bay Area campus consolidation project. Total headcount for quarter ended at 4,850, no change from September 30th. We expect our headcount will remain relatively flat during Q3. But today's report, hopefully we have closed the book on a tough two-year period which saw the cap equipment industry experience significant double digit percentage declines in both 2008 and 2009. Although business improved steadily in 2009 and we are optimistic about our prospects for calendar 2010, we will continue to manage the business prudently based upon the adjustments we have made during the last 18 months and we expect our financial performance will continue to reflect the improved leverage in our model. In summary, our guidance for Q3 is new orders are expected to be flat to plus 20% versus Q2. Total revenue between $450 million and $480 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.31 to $0.37 assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pretax income. This concludes our prepared remarks in the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Mark. We are now happy to take your questions. And we once again request each participant to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get as many callers as possible in the time allotted today. And with that, operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: (Operator instructions) your first question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
CJ Muse – Barclays Capital: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, following William print overnight, there's clearly a concern of a near-term peaking in shipments. So I guess my question is this, do you subscribe to this view or do you see a different shipment pattern for KLA, particularly given your growing leverage to memory?
Rick Wallace: Yes, CJ, it's Rick. I think that what we see as we look out is that our exposure to memory is increasing. And we did not have that much exposure in the last two quarters as we said then, we saw it going up and we continued to see that happening over time. I think that for us, it might be a little different than some of the process guys that are more capacity related and for that reason; we're anticipating an increase again in the March quarter and better prospects throughout the year. So we don't see a peaking. We also see foundry, while we don't anticipate foundry to be at the same level as percent of our business, we believe and all the indications are it will continue to be strong for us. So we don't see a short-term peak for us.
CJ Muse – Barclays Capital: Right and as a quick follow-up, on the memory side, I guess what are you looking forward to give you the confidence that memory process control will, indeed, increase and I guess can you comment on your expectations for RAM relative to DRAM.
Rick Wallace: Sure. Yeah. What we are seeing, I think, I characterize. There was an increase of reasonably dramatic increase from some of our customers in their need to respond to the market. And I think that their first inclination in those situations was to ramp up starts and get some process equipment in but they didn't really go to work on yield. We know that the native yield before people can do repairs is very low on the advanced devices, but you can make up for that with repair, but it's not long term, what you really want to be doing in process. So all the conversations and all the discussions we are having with our customers lead us to believe that there's a very high likelihood that we are going to see increased demand as we go forward and enabling our customers to get native yields up and ultimately to get their costs down over time. In terms of the NAND complexion, the NAND was about 25% of the memory orders and memory was only about 17% of what we saw in the December quarter and we anticipate those going to about 35% in the March quarter and we see memory up to probably about 35% of our overall business. So we see a third of a third being left demands. So not – not huge levels of investment yet and NAND and DRAM picking up before, NAND does.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your light is now open.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America: Is there any way, you could quantify what it was last cycle versus this cycle? Because it seems like the DDRT, additional applications that I have seen increasing the process control capital intensity, but is there any way to quantify it versus DDR2 or the prior cycle.
Rick Wallace: Krish, we don't really have – we don't have a detailed model on that or time to go over it. We have the detailed model but not really time to go over it. I think that what happened to the last cycle, of course, as we know, there was probably more capacity to put online than the market was going to support. So from that standpoint, overall intensity was higher and we don't anticipate things getting back to that level. But in a steady state, where you are not overbuilding, we do see process control intensity increasing cycle on cycle for memory, but lagging what we saw in foundry. So we do see it increasing but as I said, they have – they have a redundancy card to play which delays the insertion and we have seen that in the past with memory. So we anticipate that that will be a similar – the way things play out for us in this cycle as well.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America: Good and then I just have another big picture question. If you look at the last cyclical wafer fabs in 2007 and in 2007, it was about $30 billion. Do you actually think we could reach those levels this cycle?
Rick Wallace: Well, I have – I don't have a crystal ball that's any better than – and certainly not as active as all of you guys that cover the space. Let me put it this way, we are not building our business and planning our future based upon exceeding the prior peak. And we believe we can continue to grow and we can exceed our prior peak without the industry exceeding its prior peak. That said, if it does, we will certainly be in a position to capitalize from it. But part of our acquisition strategy was to get into new TAMs to give us new exposure to new markets so that if the next cycle wasn't as high, we still have great opportunities for growth.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Hi, this is Kate Kotlarsky for Jim Covello. A couple of questions, One I think you answered in part but just hoping you could comment on why perhaps your guys order increase was as significant as we've seen some of the other companies announced. Was it, because your foundry exposure is generally a little bit greater than some of the other companies in the space and then your memory exposures may be a little bit lower and that's where a lot of the orders are coming from? And to the extent that's true, should we expect you guys to sort of play catch-up in the next couple of quarters and see your memory business increase in line with some of the your peers?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Kate, we've had pretty steady improvement in our bookings. This is the fourth sequential up quarter for us since the December 2008 level. We feel pretty good about where we are. I can't comment on the other players. What I do know is as I just mentioned, we did not see and did not anticipate seeing memory to be a catalyst for us in the near term. We saw it as a growing and important part of our business but not the dominant part but we do see it increasing over time and we are anticipating even in this quarter, in the March quarter, where memory will go from 17% of our order book to about 35%. So – and we expect that increase to continue over time.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, you know, you had mentioned earlier that, you know, from your perspective, you don't believe that business is approaching, peak levels. If we were to think about it, sort of by segment, you know, foundry, let's say, versus memory. Do you think that the Foundry business is getting closer to peak level and the memory side of the business still has a ways to go?
Rick Wallace: I think for us, just do the model of what we said last quarter, we did in foundry in the quarter before, we did 76% of our business in September. We did 59% in December and we're anticipating about 54% in March for foundry. So it will become a smaller percent of our overall business as our business is going up. So we think foundry continues to invest at similar levels. There are some pretty big foundry projects that are not currently being booked because they are out of their out of their ways in terms of getting facilities ready. While there could be near term lows is in that, the largest foundry players are committed to increasing CapEx. The largest foundry driving those guys. So we think it should be a pretty robust year for foundry throughout the year, but, you know, you can always – it's very hard smoothing function on these to predict exactly quarter by quarter. We anticipate from the calendar year that foundry will be strong throughout 2010.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. And just a quick other one. Do you guys have an expectation for shipments for next quarter?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. We don't typically – we haven't guided shipments in the last five quarter or so, Kate. We do have an internal expectation but we don't externally guide it.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Hi. Thanks. Rick, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the memory yield challenges that you said your customers are facing. Is that any different cycle around compared to previous shrinks and where do you think we are with the overall big picture, particularly in (inaudible) as you go to the sub 3X nodes?
Rick Wallace: It is different. I mean I there was every sequential generation from memory. They start up with lower yields and they have to compensate through repair. And that' certainly, there are standings we have .Yes, it is different. I mean, I think that with every sequential generation for memory, they start off with lower yield and they have to compensate through repair and that's certainly the understanding that we have. So the native yield right out is rather low. And, you know, as we see it, that's not really different, it's got more difficult, I think for our customers. But it doesn't keep them from shipping and it actually doesn't even keep them from yielding. It keeps them from being as cost effective as they want to be. So what we plant it is, improving that overall native yield and sometimes that result them having a ship, a lower density device off the same ship because of yield concerns. So we are seeing a lot of pressure, without going any specific customer details, you can imagine what's driving it. The NAND [ph] guys are driving the most advanced design and the memory guys have a lot of concerns about the overall process integration. So we are seeing that pressure right now from many of our customers and are working closely with them to serve it. We are also, engaged heavily in the R&D but also trying to help them in production work through those problems. But I say increased problems and they do have a way to compensate, but it's harder for them, at the beginning of a ramp, they just want to get wafers out and they want to get chips out. So, I think they are more prone to start more wafers than a foundry might be.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Okay. On the foundry, how concentrated are your foundry orders? How big is, is there a number two customer placing orders in foundries at this point?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Absolutely. And it's pretty much concentrated in the sense there's a concentrated number of foundries but we are seeing activity from all of them and I think that, that really has been the story. There's obviously leading foundry companies who has been investing and has now heavy investment but others have followed as well. So we are seeing really cost foundry state. Obviously there's another foundry player with plans for a new fab coming late in the year, which will be a bit of an inflection point.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: That's very late in the year, I would have presumed, right?
Rick Wallace: Well, yes, yes.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Okay. And lastly, if you look at all of these different trends that are playing out between you guys and some of your peers, if CapEx is up 50 or 60% from these technology-type buying, how should we think of KLAC's potential to overgrow or undergrow the market this year.
Rick: Yes, we remain committed to our thesis that we can out grow the market by about 5%. And that's based on, our position in the market, our ability to grow into new markets and we think actually 2010 sets up pretty well for that when we look across our forecast and the industry projections we are talking about. We do see processed capital, process controls intensity increasing. Our calculations was it was around 13% in 2009 and we anticipate it going up in 2010 and, again into 2011. So, from that standpoint, we do see the opportunity to outgrow the overall market.
Wallace: Yes, we remain committed to our thesis that we can out grow the market by about 5%. And that's based on, our position in the market, our ability to grow into new markets and we think actually 2010 sets up pretty well for that when we look across our forecast and the industry projections we are talking about. We do see processed capital, process controls intensity increasing. Our calculations was it was around 13% in 2009 and we anticipate it going up in 2010 and, again into 2011. So, from that standpoint, we do see the opportunity to outgrow the overall market.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: What that means, Rick, is that you are reasonably comfortable in maintaining these total shipment bookings or revenue run rate as we proceed through the year? That's basically what that would imply if you want to grow 60% this year?
Rick: Right. Well, it depends on what you believe the industry will do. I am the last guy who's going to tell you what the right number is for the industry but what I will tell you is that our objective is to outperform the industry. And we think that, that's very doable with what we see right now but, of course as we all witnessed in the last couple of years, forecasting is a difficult business.
Wallace: Right. Well, it depends on what you believe the industry will do. I am the last guy who's going to tell you what the right number is for the industry but what I will tell you is that our objective is to outperform the industry. And we think that, that's very doable with what we see right now but, of course as we all witnessed in the last couple of years, forecasting is a difficult business.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: I understand. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. Gary Hsueh from Oppenheimer & Company, your line is now open. Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Hi, guys. A couple of things. I'm just trying to get to the backlog number. It looks like backlog was up $88 million on a systems basis but you only ordered $57 million more than you shipped. So was there a reverse adjustment there?
Rick Wallace: No. There wasn't a reverse adjustment in the sense that we didn't take anything out but we did actually bring a net 33 back in, which I alluded to in this distinction between new orders and net orders in the quarter, Tim. And that is that, again, when you go into an upturn, things that pushed out of our 12-month visibility which is the definition of what's on backlog. We typically take out of our backlog and call that a push out. When you are on a ramp back in, those orders tend to come back in and we brought $33 million back in on the quarter.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: I'm sorry so, Mark, so the 516 that you talked about gross is does not include those?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. It does not include those and the net number was, I believe, 549.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Okay. I got it. That makes sense. Okay. And then the second question, so if I just sort of run a very simple. I mean, this is bookings, so it's kind of flawed but if I look at your share of WFE and I look at what ASML is doing and LAM, they are pretty darn close to peak. They are 5, maybe 10% away from their sort of prior peak bookings and you are still about 20% away. Now, I certainly understand that that could be due to Samsung because they are such a big portion right now of the bookings, but is there any other factor because I know you guys talk about you know, PDC gaining as a percentage of wafer foundry equipment. It doesn't seem like it in recent years and certainly right now it doesn't seem like it either. I'm wondering if there's some customer specific issue right now that would explain it, that would reverse itself going forward, that would allow you to basically gain share. Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Yes, Tim, again, we look at calendar '09 and it did gain. We saw the intensity of process control was higher than the prior year and the early signs, I think, there will certainly be quarters where that won't be true but we think an aggregate, as we look across, we will see that play out. Obviously time will tell, but a lot of that goes to the indications. The comments that I made earlier about what's happening and particularly in memory. We were the first to admit, we were not going to come on as fast as the other guys did in memory but we see a steady increase in that as we go forward. And of course, we benefit in some areas that perhaps the other guys haven't as much. So year on year, we believe strongly in our thesis that we'll outgrow overall WFE in calendar 2009. Calendar 2010 as we did in 2009.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Okay. I will look at the numbers again. Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chin with UBS. Your line is now open.
Steven Chin – UBS: Hi, Rick and Mark. I wanted to ask, Rick, about the continued strong wafer inspection orders that you continue to show. Do you get the sense here you are taking share at foundry customers for wafer inspection and are any of the 300-millimeter wafer growers contributing yet to wafer inspection orders?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Steven. I wouldn't say we are necessarily taking share. I think our share position kind of stays in the same range as it has. I think that it is true we are seeing, I think, some benefit from adoption and so that's part of, part of our story. We did some business in their wafer segment. I wouldn't say it was the main guys but it was signs from some of the other players that we had, we had some signs of life there, which is great to see because it's been quite a while and we've talked about that in the past, that that was one of the legs that hadn't really turned on. I wouldn't say it's a large percent of our business but there was some improvement there and we would anticipate as we model the demand for wafers and the overall industry trajectory. We think that as we move through this calendar year, that business will continue to improve. But right now, it's a relatively anemic compared to prior peaks.
Steven Chin – UBS: Yeah. That was helpful. And then a follow-up question, Rick. The orders from these new products, solar and LED, they have been running about $30 million a quarter. Do you get the sense that you could see a substantial increase soon given the big solar capacity additions that are happening in the industry and the large LED capacity additions you are seeing here in 2010?
Rick Wallace: Steve, it's hard to say. We are certainly hopeful of that, but I also believe that it will take some time. I think the solar dynamics are challenging and I think that that's part of the issue here. There is capital being spent but, as we look at it, we think our share position is good. I'm a little bit waiting to see on that. So we think the current run rate we've got is pretty good. The good news for us is we are in a good margin position on that business. So, we're not in need of huge volume to be making it accretive to our model and we also didn't invest heavily in R&D for that. That's how we are playing that market.
Steven Chin – UBS: Okay. Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Rick, on the 40-nanometer buzz that continues to float around about yield challenges and flat capacity etc cetera. Is there something unusual about 40 new defect mechanisms or something that makes that very different from previous transitions in logic or is this really just the usual sort of teething with a new technology and on the same sort of learning slope that we've seen historically?
Rick Wallace: Well, I think what made it different for our customers is they couldn't see them because they were working on old technologies of ours and so from that standpoint, they got hit pretty hard by stuff they couldn't see. They had to believe it first and then when we did evaluations on our new equipment, there was a bit of a stir to get the new equipment in there so they could see the stuff. And the deal, Raj, if you can't see it, you can't fix it and that was part of the problem with those guys. As we were saying, we believe the same trend will play out in memory. There's a phase lag to it, though.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: And as you move to 32, any difference in sort of the intensity of 32, or is it the normal step up, node to node that you typically have seen in the past?
Rick Wallace: I think there's a step up. I think that the issue for us is the problems are there and the problems are getting harder. Our real challenge is making sure we've got the tools that can find the problems that the customers can then take and use to solve the problems. And so for us, it's a matter of inspecting them and reviewing them and we’ve got a lot of investment playing out, we are very solid with our roadmap but we’ve got to play it out. But we think that the trend continues and we have just got to keep executing our product development to be able to capitalize on that.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: One last one, if I might. You touched on ADE do you mentioned some signs of life, can you talk about some of the other pieces you added through acquisition ICOS and the like. Are you seeing anything there?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. We don't breakout the individual products but what I can tell you is we have seen some activity in the backend, which has been encouraging. I think the backend had really shutoff during last year and we saw that comeback and so that's encouraging, we see a number of opportunities there. We do see some high brightness LED opportunities and some good growth there but off a very small basis. Even our business like sensor, we have seen a nice pickup in that business so really they are starting to kick in. I would say the acquisitions still have a ways to go to get to their full potential and we're working very hard to see that happen but from my perspective, they represent upside as we move forward.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Company: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wenge Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.
Wenge Yang – Oppenheimer & Company: Hi, this is Wenge, actually for Gary. A couple of questions. First one is we see foundries struggling quite a bid at 40 nanometer based on your current observation, do you see the memory guys running into similar troubles, when they move to 40 nanometer DRAM or 40 nanometer in NAND technologies?
Rick Wallace: Yes. There's no question that the memory guys face yield issues, defectivity issues, metrology issues as they move down in design roles, very similar to what we’ve seen foundries and foundries may have got hit with that are up little bit earlier in the cycle. The memory guys have a bit of a hedge though, because they have redundancy and they can play off of that and that's why we believe, we have seen this lag for us in terms of our order book on the memory side. So as we go forward, we're certainly working very hard to realize those opportunities but they are definitely seeing and being challenged by the defectivity levels that they are – that they are having to deal with and it's just a matter of smaller devices, smaller design rules, so smaller defects matter now that didn't used to matter to them and there's integration challenges as well as they run these processes, which is tighter and tighter for them.
Wenge Yang – Oppenheimer & Company: Okay. Just a follow-up. Some of the process tool guys, subcomponent constraints and constraints and supply chain kind of constraints. Do you see similar things and what's your lead time at this moment compared to maybe a quarter ago?
Rick Wallace: So I would say we definitely see constraints in our supply chain. I think there's no way you can go from where the industry was, to where it is now and not have strain in the supply chain, in the same way perhaps our customers see constraints from us. That said, you can imagine there's a tremendous amount of work going on to close those gaps, to not lift those shipments and to be in a position to support our customers. So from our standpoint our materials people our manufacturing people, are working really hard and doing a great job of closing those gaps so we can meet those customer demands. But there's no question that when you whipsawed an industry the way this one has been whipsawed you will going to run into to some those constraints. Unfortunately, I think throughout the cycle we stayed very close with our key suppliers worked closely with them to be in a position to anticipate ramping up and we continue to do that and I think that that's again, there's a lot of work going on in our manufacturing area around the world to try to close those gaps.
Wenge Yang – Oppenheimer & Company: Thank you.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Steve O'Rourke – Deutsche Bank:
 :
Rick Wallace: I don't know what their visibility is, Steven. I mean I think that's part of the challenge for us. I think from our standpoint, we have pretty good dialogue and discussion with customers, I think that given the nature of our products and the lead time of our products, I think most of our customers know that the products that they want from us, they can't just get and order and get in the same quarter. So I think that gives us probably, naturally a bit more visibility into what's going on with our customer base. That's why I think if you look back at the ramp, we've been pretty consistently doing what we thought we would do relative to this ramp. So I would say from that perspective, our visibility is better actually than it's been in quite a while. A year ago, I said we had no visibility into anything. Now, I think we've got at least more like normal visibility.
Steve O'Rourke – Deutsche Bank: Okay. And can you comment on what you are seeing with the Taiwanese memory manufacturers?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. I wouldn't want to breakout specific regions. I guess, it's probably okay to talk about Taiwan. I think that Taiwan has got a couple of – you really obviously the kind of two groups there and I think that there has been as you know, more investment, at least dollars becoming available and I think given the pricing and this better than I do, I think they are in a better position to make investments going forward. And Taiwan obviously, has been an important region for us but I would say that the next four quarters I think will tell the story, because we are anticipating more investment in memory overall and if anyone doesn't invest over the next four quarters, I think they are going to have to have a different strategy beyond that because they are just going to be out of position. I think everybody got a bit of a pass if you go back over the last year of not investing because the leaders had backed off so much that’s no longer, okay. So the deal if you don't keep your investment going you better find a different strategy that doesn't rely on the leading edge, does that make sense.
Steve O'Rourke – Deutsche Bank: It does. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer with ROK [ph] Research. Your line is now open.
Jagadish Iyer – ROK Research: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, two questions. First is how do you see the subsequent between wafer inspection, metrology and reticle inspection playing all that's going into '10 and as a follow-up, I wanted to find out how do you see the metrology business coming along particularly in light of new materials and new technology being adopted? Thank you. And a question for also for Mark is that these one-time charges, when do you – how do you see them going forward for the next few quarters? Thank you.
Mark Dentinger: Okay. Why don't you take the first?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. Why don't we start with the one-time charges, they are not actually technically all of one-time. We have an unresolved stock option litigation exercise, which we're hoping comes to an end at some point in the future, but that's very difficult to predict and as long as that's out there, we are adopting the industry convention and sweeping that up. Obviously, that's one where it will not be ongoing in the long-term run in the model but it's hard to say when it gets cutoff short-term. The second – sort of batch of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments goes with acquisition premiums. Typically, those intangible assets that we acquire along with the acquisitions, they get amortized over three to five years and if you don't do an acquisition for three to five years after about a five period, you will see those things essentially fade away. The third category is something that is completely out of the normal operating purview of the company has just a one-time settlement something like that those are little bit difficult to predict. In terms of restructuring charges, which we do have a small amount this quarter, we're pretty much near the end of that presuming we don't have a big course correction with the worldwide economic situation in 2010. The latest restructuring charge had to deal with the campus consolidation from us moving to out of our performer [ph] over to repeated that is now done. So we don't anticipate anything there. The final category, which I won't bore you with has to do with the tax treatment of employee stock grants and that is – that we are earn an unusual meaning that not many other companies are in it, where we are in an excess shortfall position cumulatively and when you are in that position the tax impact, if it exceeds the book impact of employee stock charges actually windup running through your tax expense line, instead of your equity. That will go back and forth between quarters most companies are not in the excess shortfall position, so they basically take all of those charges through equity, we are doing that sometimes in the quarters in which we are taking through in the tax expense line we are scheduling them out. So the short answer your question is the nonrecurring stuff that comes out of the blue that's hard to see should be infrequent. The other areas where we are seeing some consistently – some consistency hopefully fade in the relatively, let's call it the intermediate term. It won't be next quarter.
Jagadish Iyer – ROK Research: Thank you.
Rick Wallace: All right and on your question regarding wafer versus metrology and what we see for that, we have been in the wafer metrology radical and service. And I will give you a perspective, we did see wafer increase in the December quarter of 42%, metrology is down slightly as wafer picked up to 13 radical went up from 21 to 15 and service crept up to 24. There is a lot of opportunity in metrology and as we go forward we do see a lot of opportunity, but that's another case where we've just got to be in a position to capitalize on it. So, some of it is a matter of us executing on our products and demonstrating that to our customers. So we think there's a lot of opportunity. That said, I would say right now there's probably more opportunity in the yield challenges that our customers face. So I don't know that we're going to see metrology increase as a percentage given the enormous opportunities there are in wafer inspection. But there's definitely growth potential in metrology and we are, I think well positioned to build on that as we go forward. Radical is kind of an interesting story. That's a lumpier business because of the nature of the products that we have and I think that we will continue to see strength in radical but it will continue to be lumpy just by the nature of the ASPs and the relative small number of units that we sell and radical. And service while we have seen healthy service growth in an environment where CapEx is growing faster, service ends up becoming a smaller percentage of the business. In an environment where the CapEx is growing slower, service becomes a larger percent. Does that answer your question?
Jagadish Iyer – ROK Research: Yes. I didn't, just a clarification. I just wondered on the year-over-year basis, on the fiscal year-over-year basis, do you think the wafer inspection can probably outgrow the other three segments.
Rick Wallace: It really depends. I think they all have opportunities and inside it's a horse race for these guys to see how the different divisions operate. I definitely think that there's tremendous opportunities for metrology but it's like anything you've just got to execute against them. So right now, we have models but we are not forecasting any particular segment over the other. I would say the yield challenges out there have certainly presented a lot of opportunities but you look at advanced lithography and it creates a lot of metrology opportunities as well.
Jagadish Iyer – ROK Research: Okay. Thank you, that's helpful.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Hi, Rick. Just a quick follow-up on something you were saying. If you look at foundry orders and you look at memory orders versus prior peak, it's pretty interesting how much lower memory orders are for you versus the peak and foundry is much higher. Obviously that has much to do with the 4X yield issues that the foundries are actually having but NAND has now moved through 4X and they haven't their bookings haven't picked up very much. So I'm wondering what's going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back for the DRAM guys to ultimately see the same yield issues that the foundry guys have. Because I am just sort of wondering whether there is something structural that’s changed for the DRAM guys that may be their sort of process inspection and intensity if the will gone down.
Rick Wallace: Yes. Tim, it's a good question. I think, again, what we attribute it to is kind of two things. One is there's no question that the memory guys have not seen the same level of pain causing them to act as the foundry guys. No question. Just shows in our numbers. I think the other question is have we demonstrated our capability as effectively with the memory guys causing them to act? And I would say that's where we have more work to do. We think we have done some good work. We think it's going to continue to progress. We think the opportunity is there but I'm like you in terms of we've got to demonstrate it and prove it and we saw signs of improvement over the last quarter. We are forecasting March again up. I think we have been pretty consistent on what we have been able to do with memory but we have to demonstrate it over the next year. We think the opportunity is there. We just think that we've got to execute and demonstrate our abilities there and then the numbers will prove themselves. But it's pretty hard to argue with the analysis to date.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: But I guess, Rick. I'm just sort of wondering are they telling you that it's just a matter of time so they are saying look, we have problems down the pipe it's Just as a six months from today whenever we get all of this other equipment and we start to ramp production that's when we are going to have the problems. Or are these things that only you see coming from your side not from the customer side?
Rick Wallace: No. I think, Timmy gets down to a conversation that goes like this. Look, if you can solve this problem for us, if you can demonstrate you can find these defects at this throughput at this cost of ownership, we will deploy your tool. If you haven't done demonstrated that then we are going to wait and see and we are going to find other ways around it. One other way around it is repair but we don't like that because that's a painful process and ultimately we need you to solve the problem. So I think there's some technical challenges that we've got to overcome. There's some demonstrating that we've got to do and if we execute on that and we are seeing signs of that and we will see it continue to grow as part of our business, you know from my standpoint, the good news is the opportunity is there. The challenge for us is to demonstrate that our tool set solves those problems and we'll generate the ROI. So I think the opportunity is there. We just got to execute on it.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Got it. Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Rick. Another question on metrology. Metrology seems to be a lot more volatile for example 2008, when the market was down 33% you were down only 4% but this year the market is down close to 40% and you are down close to 55, 60%. Why are you seeing that volatility? Is it related to the wafer market volatility?
Rick Wallace: So did you check out our metrology percent, you tracked it over time? That's how you came up with that.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets:
. :
Rick Wallace: Right. Okay.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: I get it from that.
Rick Wallace: I think that's a great question. It's not about the wafer. It's much more related metrology probably as a better proxy for us for process equipment. It's the part of our business that looks more like process equipment than does our wafer business. But the products that go and sell to the wafer manufacturers, if that's what you were referring to.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Right.
Rick Wallace: Are actually not in the metrology group. More so.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
Rick Wallace: They are much more dominantly in the wafer group.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: The 80 portion of the business that also goes in the inspection group?
Rick Wallace: Yes. That's part of wafer.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And a question on OpEx. At the current level like the way you guided EPS, you are sort of in 160, 165 kind of range. Is that what we should model for 500 kind of run rate, 165 kind of number? Is that still valid?
Rick Wallace: Yes. we don't expect to add as I indicated the two operative left three operative levers in operating expenses are the head count levels of the company how much material procurement we do on new purchase and development projects. That can go up and down a little bit. Right now it's fairly stable and the other is variable compensation which does tend to go up and down with our expectations about the business, but as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we wouldn't expect to see wild fluctuations in the expense level at least in the near to intermediate term. I will call it less than six to nine months. At least for the short term, for short term modeling purposes I wouldn't expect it to move around a lot.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, operator. That concludes the time we have for our call today. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you later on in the quarter. Thank you.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the KLA-Tencor Corporation first quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ed Lockwood, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Paula. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to KLA-Tencor's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Dentinger, Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss first quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2009. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time and if you haven't seen the release you can find it on our Web site at www.klatencor.com or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today’s call with updates on the current market environment and the company's performance in the September quarter and provide guidance for the December quarter. Afterwards Mark Dentinger will review the preliminary financial results for the quarter and then we'll open the call for questions. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the investor section of our Web site. On the Web site you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and investor conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2009. In those filings you'll find descriptions of Risk Factors that could impact our future results. As you know our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks. KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time including our fiscal year 2009 Form 10-K and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update these forward-looking statements. However, you can be assured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Welcome to our first quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings call. Let me start with the highlights. Q1 was a strong quarter for KLA-Tencor. Bookings revenue and EPS all topping our previously revised guidance. Revenue was $343 million, an increase of 22% compared with June and we returned to profitability in the quarter. Non-GAAP net income per share including stock-based compensation but excluding some one-time items was $0.15 in Q1. Net income for the quarter includes a one-time non-operating gain of about $0.06 per share related to an international tax matter. We generated $73 million in operating cash flow in the period and our cash position grew to a healthy $1.4 billion at quarter-end. So, clearly a very good result for KLA-Tencor. Though there is still uncertainty about the pace of global economic recovery, our industry environment continues to strengthen off the low seen at the beginning of the year, while the market for capital equipment is clearly stronger than it’s been in some time; the demand is still primarily focused on advanced technology development. We're also now seeing a broader range of customers moving ahead with capital investment plans in addition to the market leaders. So at this point it feels like the worst is behind us. We have a lot of optimism as we look ahead at the next stage of the industry growth because we believe we're in an early part of a capital investment cycle characterized by increased technical complexity and more challenging yield issues for our customers. This in turn should drive higher adoption of process control technology and position KLA-Tencor for growth in excess of the industry. To benefit from that growth we continue to invest heavily and maintain a high pace of innovation. In September quarter we launched several new products to address Next Generation technology development in our core markets. I'm excited to say we're seeing strong customer interest and we begin to take orders for these new products. I'll have more specifics to discuss on the technology front in my comments to follow. Even with our optimism and our improving outlook, we remain financially conservative and continue to focus on optimizing our cost structure while responding to the improving business conditions. With the actions we've taken in recent quarters we've successfully managed our cost structure to quarterly breakeven revenue of around $325 million and our business is positioned to generate incremental gross margins in the targeted 60% to 70% range with incremental operating margin leverage in the range of 50% to 60%. We're well positioned to deliver even higher operating leverage than we did at comparable revenue levels in the past. Turning now to some specifics on the current demand picture, gross bookings in Q1 were up sharply to $493 million, an increase of 50% compared with June, driven by increased investment in memory and foundries. Demand was primarily for technology buys, focused on conversions and advanced technology development with some capacity investment at the advanced node. We also benefited from a major new product introduction in our Reticle Inspection business which is enjoying strong initial market acceptance. Foundry was 76% of new orders. We saw greater breadth in demand among our foundry customers in the September quarter. Historically, foundry customers have been high adopters of process control due to the nature of the foundry business model. Memory grew sequentially in the September quarter to 13% of orders on increasing technology buys. We see overall memory orders levels on the upswing. Logic was down sequentially in Q1 to 11% of booking. We do expect to see an increase in logic investment in the December quarter. As you know, technology changes that enable Moore's Law are a constant in our industry. Regardless of where we are in the industry cycle, chip manufacturers are continuously innovating to lower the cost of production and improve performance of their products. Process control is a key enabler of innovation for our customers. As the market leader in process control, investment in innovation is a top priority for KLA-Tencor, maintaining a focus on technology brings us closer to our customers extends our competitive advantage and strengthens our leadership position. Here are some highlights of just a few of our recent new products. First, we introduced and took orders in the September quarter for the new Teron 600 Reticle inspection tool. The industry’s first sub-32-nanometer production capable Photo Mask Inspection System. We've received initial orders for this new platform from customers in IC manufacturing and merchant mass shop markets contributing to our very strong sequential order growth in Q1. We also booked orders in the quarter for our new 2830 Brightfield Inspection Systems. The 2830 features a revolutionary high brightness light source that enables more repetitive, more capture of difficult defects for accelerated ramp of leading edge devises. KLA Tencor's new Brightfield platform is critical for advanced technology development and its generated strong customer interest. And finally during the quarter we entered into beta agreement with a leading memory customer for our Next Generation Darkfield Inspection System, the Puma 9500. The 9500 is designed to dramatically increase throughput and sensitivity from our prior generation Darkfield technology. We expect to see increased demand for the 9500 as capacity investments resume over the next several quarters. In Summary, the challenges our customers face today and advancing on Moore’s Law are significant. KLA-Tencor continues to drive innovation and maintain a rapid pace of new product development to help our customers address these challenges and remain on their technology road maps. In terms of guidance for Q2 FY10, we expect demand to once again be focused primarily on technology buys with memory increasing as a percentage of the total. We expect orders in December to be flat plus or minus 10% compared with September. Revenues are expected to be between $420 million and $450 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.24 to $0.30 per share. I will now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark?
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. As most of you know we present our income statement in two formats, one under U.S. GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization in write-downs of intangible assets associated with acquisition. Expenses associated with our stock options related litigation and certain costs and expenses which we do not expect to be recurring such as restructuring charges. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks and operations will reference non-GAAP income statement, but where I reference GAAP numbers I'll make the distinction before reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our Web site. Revenue for Q1 was $343 million, over the high end of the guided range we provided in July of $295 million to $335 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.15, also above the favorable end of our guidance range of a $0.10 loss to breakeven. Our Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.12. Earnings guidance range assumed non-operating expenses of $10 million in a tax rate of 30%. In the quarter, we recorded an OIE gain of $8 million and we posted a tax rate of only 17%. The effect of both the OIE gain and the low tax rate added $0.09 to both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. The summary of the differences between this quarter's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are as follows Acquisition related charges of $8 million before taxes were $0.03 per share after taxes. Restructuring and severance credit of $4 million before taxes or $0.02 per share benefit after taxes. And stock option litigation expenses of $5 million pre-tax or $0.02 per share after taxes. At SEMICON West in July, Rick indicated that the improved order activity we experienced late in our June quarter would drive an unseasonably strong fiscal Q1 and that proved to be true. Looking forward while business conditions have improved in the first half of the calendar year, visibility into a broad-based capacity driven expansion remains limited. New orders for Q1 were $493 million, an increase of 50% over Q4, significantly above the high-end of our guided range of flat plus 20% from last quarter's new bookings of $327 million. This quarter, $16 million in orders pushed out of our 12 month delivery window resulting in net new orders of $477 million. We ended the quarter with $649 million in total systems backlog after adjusting for foreign exchange impact. The backlog at September 30 included $223 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped and invoiced, but it's not yet recognized as revenue and $426 million in system orders that have not yet shipped. Most of the backlog typically ships over the following six months. The approximate regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows The U.S. was 13% of new system orders in Q1, down from 29% in June quarter. Europe was 3% in new systems orders, down from 4% in Q4 of '09. Japan was 9%, up from 4% last quarter. Korea was 6%, down from 13% last quarter. Taiwan was 51%, up from 46% last quarter. And the rest of Asia was 18%, up from 4% in Q4. The approximate Q1 distribution of new systems and services orders by product as well as the quarter-to-quarter change in distribution was as follows Wafer inspection was 32%, down from 34% last quarter. Reticle inspection was 22%, up from 10% last quarter. Metrology was 17%, down from 18% in the prior quarter. And solar storage high brightness LED and other non-semi was 7% even with last quarter. Services was 22% of new orders in Q1, down from 31% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 76% of semiconductor systems orders in Q1 versus 53% in Q4. Logic and memory orders were 11% and 13% in Q1 versus 37% and 10% respectively in Q4. Technology purchases generated most of the activity this quarter with 45-nanometer and below development pilot activity comprising 95% of the semiconductor systems orders versus 97% of orders received in the June quarter. We expect the Q1 strengthen order activity to continue in the December quarter, and as a result we are assuming new orders in Q2 will be flat with Q1 plus or minus 10%. Shipments in Q1 which included both system shipments and services revenue were $383 million, up 11% from $344 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q1 was up 30% to $229 million versus $176 million in Q4. Services revenue was $114 million in Q1, up from $105 million in Q4. Our expectations for total revenue in Q2 is a range between $420 million and $450 million and we expect services to contribute a little less than 30% of the total. Non-GAAP gross margin was 51% in September quarter, up five percentage points from the June quarter. The improved margin percentage in Q1 was partly because we took about $10 million less in excess and obsolete charges than in Q4 and partly because of capacity improvements. In Q2, we expected our gross margin percentage will improve slightly because of the incremental margin on higher expected revenue. Operating expenses were $153 million, an increase of $5 million from the June quarter. R&D was 78 million, about flat with Q4. And selling general and administrative expenses or SG&A were $75 million, a $5 million increase from last quarter. The primary reason for the increase in operating expenses was a higher accrual rate for variable pay based on our updated full year projections for operating profit. These higher accruals resulted in $8 million in additional operating expenses this quarter. Without the additional accruals, operating expenses would have been about $145 million or about $3 million down versus Q4. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $8 million credit in Q1 or approximately $19 million higher than our Q4 net expense of $11 million. The higher Q1 net credit is largely due to a non-recurring $16 million gain from reversing a consumption tax contingency which is no longer required. Without this credit, OIE would have been a net expense of about $8 million. In Q2, we expect OIE to be a net expense of approximately $9 million to $10 million. In Q1, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $6 million or 17% of pre-tax income versus a $15 million credit in Q4 when we had a pre-tax loss of $30 million. The 17% rate this quarter was lower than our 30% model rate largely because of a non-taxable investment gain on our deferred compensation plan. Consistent with the last few quarters, lower negative pre-tax profits coupled with other unique factors each quarter make predicting short-term tax rates difficult and we're modeling a 30% rate for December quarter. Beginning this quarter we anticipate that our GAAP tax rate will be adversely affected by an additional non-cash component that we estimate will add $5 million to $10 million an additional tax expense in Q2. This additional GAAP tax expense results from how accounting rules are applied to excess shortfalls associated with employee stock activity. This issue is more fully described in our Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2009, and will also be described in the 10-Q we file for this quarter. Because this expense is non-cash, non-predictable and materializes only when a Company is in net shortfall position. We will remove the effect of this charge when preparing our non-GAAP statements in the future, but we will highlight the charge each quarter in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Non-GAAP net income was $26 million, or $0.15 per share in Q1. These numbers include a pre-tax stock based compensation expenses of $20 million. Our model tax rate of 30% and excluding the OIE credit, our non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.06 this quarter. At the revenue range I previously mentioned we would expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be somewhere between $0.24 and $0.30 per share, assuming a tax rate of 30%. The weighted average shares used to compute EPS in Q1 were 173 million versus 170 million in Q4. Primary reason for the increase in shares was because we were profitable in Q1 and therefore we included the effect of potentially diluted securities. For the December quarter, we also expect to be profitable so our average share count should be approximately 174 million assuming we do not repurchase shares. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.4 billion, an increase of $57 million quarter-to-quarter. Cash generated from operations of $73 million in Q1 equal to what we generated in Q4. In Q2, our cash flow from operations should improve because we are anticipating a significant U.S. federal income tax refund based on a decision to carry back our 2009 income tax loss to prior years. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at 244 million, up from $210 million at June 30, because of higher shipments. DSOs were 65 days at September 30, versus 68 days at the end of June. Net inventory decreased by $23 million from last quarter and ended the quarter at $347 million as we began consuming inventories that built up earlier this year. Net capital expenditures were $4 million in Q1 versus $2 million in Q4. Total headcount ended the quarter at 4850, a net decrease of 89 from June 30. We expect our headcount will remain relatively flat during Q2. Over the last year we've talked about our plan to reduce our quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to the $140 million to $145 million range by our December '09 quarter. We've now completed most of the steps we contemplated and the only differences between our stated goal and current spending levels are the results of adding back some of the temporary compensation and benefit reductions we enacted last fiscal year. While we don't have a time table for completely restoring these cuts, our belief is that complete restoration at today's headcount levels would raise our quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses to about $165 million. In summary, our guidance for Q2 is, new orders are expected to be flat, plus or minus 10% versus Q1. Total revenue between $420 million and $450 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.24 to $0.30, assuming a tax rate of 30% of the pre-tax income. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter and we'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay, thank you, Mark. We'll now take your questions and we once again request each participant to please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get to as many callers as possible in a time allotted today. And with that, Operator, we are ready for our first question.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Barclays Capital.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first part, in your prepared remarks you talked about calling it an early stage of recovery and I guess I was hoping you could talk about your visibility into the first half of 2010, I guess particularly around sustainability of spending from the foundries.
Rick Wallace: Sure, C. J., it's Rick. What we're seeing now I think is a couple things. One, a number of foundries that are investing has broadened so clearly we saw that has a benefit. And the other thing we're seeing is the advanced technology that is really being pushed by the foundries now, there are a lot of starts have happened and there's a lot of demand for the events out of the foundries. They just have to make investments to catch up to that. Whether it can remain at exactly this level or go down, I think it's hard to say, but on balance, when we look out to December and think forward, we think that there continues to be opportunity in the foundry space for a couple reasons. One is there's increasing demand on the low end and we don't have a large percent of the revenues generated on the advanced design rules. The second one is I think we're finally seeing the effect of the guys that went offline a few years ago, some of the major guys that were investing that had shifted their production over to the foundries and now we're seeing foundries finally starting to invest to essentially absorb some of that CapEx so we see the situation pretty good because of the challenges they face and I think probably favoring inspection Metrology in particular for their needs.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Great, and then I guess is my quick follow-up, you talked also about the Puma 9500 Darkfield Inspection and seeing some success there. I was hoping I guess in light of that success you could talk about capital intensity for process control from memory users and what kind of trends you're seeing there?
Rick Wallace: Sure. It's still I think early to say because most of what we've seen in the memory side has been relative to development and so I think it's really more customer-specific what kind of intensity they have than sector in particular, so there's a range across them, but I think the current way we see the market developing much the same way the foundries had to turn on and invest more heavily to get their yields up, we're seeing some of the early signs in memory that will be similar to that, but I'd say it's too early to say that thesis has been proven out. So I'd say we are where we were with foundry, say, a year ago relative to memory.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Hi. Couple things. First of all, Mark, can you give us some shipment guidance?
Mark Dentinger: Yes. We aren't guiding shipments, Tim. I know this has come up before, but we haven't guided it for over a year and we are not prepared to guide it today.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Okay, just as a comment, it is helpful to kind of help us plan the business. Second question, as you kind of look at the debt now that you have relative to last cycle, it takes roughly between $0.30 and $0.50 in kind of earnings power away this cycle relative to what it was last cycle because you have kind of a flip in the other income line. So as you think about earnings power this cycle versus last cycle, is there something that you feel like you have to do to sort of make up that difference? How do you sort of view that debt level as it relates to compressing possible earnings power this time versus last cycle?
Mark Dentinger: Yes, well, it's not the only way we view it, Tim, but the simple way to view it is that although the debt obviously decreases the earnings power through the income statement yet if you view the debt as actually a vehicle for repurchasing your share it increases your earnings per share power through the share count. So at some level, you are making a trade-off if you just look at it that in simplistic way. But the real issue is that KLA-Tencor basically has a predictive enough earnings model and is strong enough to basically have a portion of it capital structure allocated to a less expensive form of capital, which is the debt. And if we could come through what our fiscal 2009 was and still generate almost $200 million in operating income, the logical question would be why wouldn't you have some leverage and that's certainly what we went out and did. So, the real answer to the question is, is that the debt is a cheaper form of financing than the equity.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Yes, I guess my question is whether you're going to buyback stock? That's all.
Mark Dentinger: Oh, yes. It will certainly come under consideration, now that it appears we've cleared through the worst of the down cycle and we'll be certainly talking about that in the coming days. We've an active authorization available to go back and tap and it's probably high time we go back and examine that question.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Okay, thanks, Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Hi, this is Kate Kotlarsky for Jim Covello. I had a quick question about activity that you guys are seeing in the memory side. I know you have talked about orders still being driven by technology transitions for the most part. I was curious what your conversations with customers are like now about potential capacity addition, particularly given some of the shortages we're seeing both on the DRAM and NAND side today. Thank you.
Mark Dentinger: Sure, Kate, I think that the way I characterize the memory players is that they're all still a little bit thankful to be in a position where they're generating cash, but not confident enough yet to be adding significant capacity, so you've seen the spot prices come up, they're cash positive now, but I think being pretty conservative in terms of their investments and most of us has been focused on technology as opposed to capacity and maybe converting some of the existing capacity to new technology nodes. So I think that like everyone they're waiting to see how real these trends are, and there's some particular drivers for memory that are going to be important to watch. Two, that come to mind immediately are the new operating system just released from Microsoft does that, is that a part of a PC reinvestment cycle, and the other one is associated with NAND, is there another stimulus and driver for NAND capacity so, I think both of those things is early to call and I haven't seen a lot of discussion about new capacity investment across the memory front, as we said it's probably more conversion. In order for this to turn into a full blown recovery though we will need to see memory investing at a more healthy rate and the way we're modeling that is that doesn't happen until later in 2010.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: That's really helpful, and then maybe just more of a housekeeping question. I just wanted to understand the one-time gain a little bit better. Was there a one-time gain both in the tax item and then also in other income or is there just one item for the quarter?
Mark Dentinger: It's one item and an unusual phenomenon that happens to taxes, but it's not one-time. So there was one item in other income which was that we resolved a consumption tax contingency, which was in an international location that added about $16 million of favorability through the other income line. That is one-time, in a sense that it doesn't recur every quarter. In the tax line our rate was unusually low this quarter, but part of the reason that it's low right now is that the aggregate earnings aren't very big so, a small phenomenon that maybe unique to the quarter can swing it quite a bit and the phenomenon that did swing it is that the investments that are in our deferred compensation plan increased during the quarter, they are non-deductible so, as a result we got a tax break as a result. That will happen once in a while because the investments do swing up and down so although it was lower than our model rate I wouldn't describe it as one-time.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay, so the item you guys referenced in the press release was referring to that $16 million in the other income line?
Mark Dentinger: That's right.
Kate Kotlarsky – Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you. That's it for me.
Mark Dentinger: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Yes, hi, thanks. Rick, if I look at your memory exposure versus your peers there's a clear discrepancy with you being a lot lower than say someone like a LAN or an SML, and your exposure to the lot high for foundry, foundries are adding both capacity and shrinking memory is a bit more of the shrink I would have thought you were more exposed to shrinks and capacity. What sort of explains that maybe you can help by giving us your outlook for orders by type and December quarter that better helps us understand that?
Rick Wallace: Sure, Satya. We see memory going up, I think we ended as we said about 13% and we're modeling in the 20% to 25% range for memory for the December so we do see it increasing and I think that's equally split for us the way we view it right now between NAND and Flash or NAND Flash and DRAM. So, we're seeing some exposure. I think I mentioned earlier on the question I got regarding this that it does look as though the customers are in the early stages of some of the advanced technology and we expect that they are going to hit some speed bumps relative to yield ramp and that's when we would expect to see intensity increase for the memory guys.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Okay. Couple of quick follow-ups, on gross margin, how should we think about incremental gross margins going forward? And on lead times, you're guiding revenue substantially below your bookings run rate of September. Are your lead times stretching out for any of the products that you make? I know it's different for different products, but I was wondering if you can add some color around that.
Rick Wallace: I'll give an initial thought and then let Mark follow-up. Incremental gross margin we're modeling 60% to 70% as we go forward. We feel good about that and we've got a lot of programs going inside to support that and I think in terms of lead times, part of this is we have seen a relatively aggressive snapback in terms of orders, what we saw last quarter and so as a result we do have some push outs and you're right, it is somewhat product dependent, and, of course, we work closely with our customers to manage their delivery requirements for that, but there is some stress in terms of getting, making shipments given the recent activity we're seeing.
Satya Kumar – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Banc of America-Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America-Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question. Rick, I had two questions. One is if I look at your bookings guidance clearly nice jump in bookings and at a flat guidance you're probably about a third to 40% below the last peak, in other words, I'm trying to understand for the bookings to move higher from here do we need memory to come back or can foundry and logic alone take it from here?
Rick Wallace: Yes, we need memory to come back. We also don't have much activity in some of the other plays we have. For example, we sell to the wafer manufacturers and they've been very modest in terms of their overall investment level. So we definitely need to see that sector. The sector that did turn on last quarter is the Reticle sector which had been very dormant for a while, and so we got one of the legs back at the engine, but it's true. Memory is still not on and the wafer manufacturers are not on so we need to see those guys kick in.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America-Merrill Lynch: Got it. And just a follow-up, in terms of your migration to Singapore and margin upside from that, clearly, you're seeing a pretty good jump in revenues in December. At what revenue level do you think we'll start seeing the gross margin kicker coming in because of the manufacturing transition?
Rick Wallace: I'll take a pass and then Mark wants to add to it. Singapore doesn't manufacture all our products. It's somewhat product dependent and some of the order activity we've seen we don't break out by product line, we have a mix of those products and I would say it hasn't emphasized the products that are in Singapore and so we need to see a broader based recovery really for the Singapore aspect of the operation. But I would also say we've made operational improvements in all our manufacturing sites as we've gone through this downturn so that's why we can support the incremental operating margin of 50% to 60% as we go forward which gives us higher leverage than we've had in previous cycles at the same revenue level.
Mark Dentinger: Yes, I would just add to that that getting Singapore up to a full capacity is contemplated in both our incremental gross margin and our incremental operating margin leverage equation. It is not there yet, but it is anticipated and contemplated in those numbers.
Krish Sankar – Banc of America-Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer: Hi, thanks for taking my question. If I look at your guidance for orders being kind of flattish but still the Reticle inspection having a pretty massive come back here to the $100 million level, is your guidance basically for Reticle inspection to kind of subside back down without more meaningful contribution from the memory guys? Is it really more of a Reticle inspection driven sort of guidance here in terms of your order number for the December quarter and then I have a follow-up?
Mark Dentinger: Gary, you're paying attention. Yes, exactly that. So I think you might know our process probably explained in the past. When bringing on a new product we can only take orders on that when we reach a certain point in our product development cycle and we have the customer agreements to support it. So there's a process we go through. Reticle having a new product introduction we did see an initial as you say very strong level of business for the Reticle side and while we expect Reticle continue to do well, the $100 million that you referred to annualized that's we won't see that level for Reticle until we're in a full blown recovery and we don't believe we're at a full blown recovery so, exactly right how you characterized it.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer: Okay. Congratulations on the success of rolling that 193-nanometer light source Reticle inspection tool out. Given the fact that it's a relatively new tool should we expect this Reticle inspection tool to kind of layer or add on to the P&L at above the 60% to 70% incremental gross margin kind of fall through, like most of your Reticle inspection tools or will the first batch of Reticle inspection tools given the fact that they're relatively new in the product development cycle do they come with a little bit lower drop through? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Yes, Gary as you know we don't break out the product, specific products, but I can tell you that we have certainly contemplated all the new products that we've introduced as we talk about our incremental operating margin and incremental gross margin and clearly Reticle is a product that we've been counting on and have been talking about being in development for some time so it will support our 50% to 60% incremental operating margin story and our gross margin story as well.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth of Cowen & Co.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Co.: Thank you. Mark, both you and Rick have referenced higher margins on revenues versus last cycle, I wonder if maybe you could detail that a little bit, I don’t know, 500, 600, 700, what was the model, what do you think the model moves to?
Mark Dentinger: The easiest thing to do, Raj, is to pencil out from where we were in the last model which we basically had an operating margin of 19% when we got quarterly revenue run rate of about 500 million. We think we'll do a little bit better than that in this cycle and if you can pencil out from here where we are to-date and use an incremental gross margin of 60% to 70%, a point along that line and you can use an incremental operating margin of 50% to 60% you pencil that out. I think you'll see that we probably do have some more earnings power at this model. I always issue the caveat that, of course, it will depend on exact composition of the revenue mix as we reescalate, but we've modeled this under a variety of different scenarios and most of the scenarios suggest you get more earnings power out of this up than you've got out of the last time we had the model published.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Co.: And that 500 should I assume something on the order of 165 OpEx per your earlier comment about some of the comp related costs coming back?
Mark Dentinger: I don't know about that. It might be easier to say if you had a fully loaded OpEx meeting with all of the compensation costs back in and then you leverage that at 50% to 60% cost. That maybe a little bit more accurate way to do it because we are feathering in those cost reduction, the temporary cost reduction actions as we go back up. But the reality is that we think 165 would be today's outcome with all of the cuts fully restored at today's headcount levels. So you can sort of draw linear line from there. I would say headcount wouldn't remain exactly flat, but we're hoping it wouldn't go up radically from there.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Co.: And if I might a quick follow-up on the Reticle business. Rick, what actually are the drivers there? Clearly, you got a new product out, there's some initial investment for people that need to build some really capacity to support I suppose 32. Is that starts driven or what ultimately drives other than that new product intro, the cycle in Reticle, that you're hoping to see as you move forward at some point?
Rick Wallace: Maybe not so much start, well it depends, I guess new designs is really what drives it, Raj, new take outs, new designs, and a pretty long gap in terms of investment by some of these guys, and also early look at advanced technologies. Historically when we've introduced new Reticle platform, we've done pretty well with them because there's a pent-up demand for the new capability.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Co.: Right. Have you seen any pick up other than that pop from the new product?
Rick Wallace: Well, yes, I mean the rest of the business we saw increase as well so if you do the math on it you can see Reticle was up, but partly why we exceeded I think above the range is we did see increasing strength in Reticle, but also we saw just foundry-related investment associated with the ramp that's going on there.
Raj Seth – Cowen & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Chin on UBS.
Stephen Chin – UBS: Great, thanks, hi Rick and Mark. Nice execution at these foundry customers. Any way you can estimate how much market share you think you've taken at the foundry customers and you believe its mostly in Reticle inspection and Brightfield products or other products? I got a follow-up question.
Rick Wallace: Yes, so the way we look at share, we measure it all the time, but I think it's awfully noisy so I like to aggregate it over a few quarters and I was just looking at some estimates we have for 2009 and it looks remarkably similar to what we've seen in the past, Stephen, in terms of overall share story, pretty much across the product line. I'll say what is different in this phase of the cycle is certain products are more emphasized at different phases and this being more technology oriented tends to favor more the products that are more about early phase characterization and development and Reticle had its own dynamics based on the new product introduction, but clearly Brightfield was strong for us as well. There just wasn't as much activity in some of the other historically strong product lines for us so it was favored by those, but not so much because of a share as it was just where they were in the cycle. Does that make sense?
Stephen Chin – UBS: Yes, that's helpful, thanks, Rick. The second question I had is could you share your latest thinking on 2010 industry capital spending, year-over-year and how you see the linearity of the CapEx spend across the first half of the year versus the second half of the year for the industry perhaps playing out?
Rick Wallace: Sure, and I think we're also good at doing it last year that we should be confident in next year as well. It's really hard as you know to forecast the stuff, Stephen, so we're looking at right now our estimates for the year for 2010, when we look at the analyst estimates, the broad range of industry watchers and you guys, we're modeling in a 35% to 45% increase in CapEx for 2010, but that is obviously contingent on many factors, not the least of which is that memory returns to some kind of increased investment level because we can't get there without memory, as we said foundry and logic just wouldn't be enough to sustain that. But more important to us than specifically what the overall levels are is just how we've positioned across each one of the sectors so we probably spend more time working on that than we do worrying about absolute numbers because we've been able to respond in either direction, but historically we're pretty confident we can in this cycle as well. If it does pick up and go faster then that we'll be able to support it.
Stephen Chin – UBS: Thanks, Rick.
Mark Dentinger: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Ho of Stifel Nicolaus.
Mary – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, this is Mary [ph] in for Patrick Ho. Thank you for taking my question. First one is in terms of the business model, now that you're profitable, how much of the temporary costs that you have already taken are coming back?
Mark Dentinger: Yes, well, Mary, this is Mark, as I described we actually began feathering in some of those costs this quarter. We added $8 million of expenses this quarter again relative to what we experienced in the prior quarter in contemplation that we will be adding back some variable compensation this year, but that's only a step towards what we would say would be the final destination. If this quarter we incurred about $153 million worth of operating expenses when we feathered them all back in we'll probably have a cost structure with today’s headcount levels of about $165 million which is $12 million ahead so if you want to use very loose math we're about 40% of the way to feathering everything back in.
Mary – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Great. And a follow-up, given that demand has picked up, can you comment maybe on your suppliers and if you are seeing component shortages or any tightness in the supply chain and if so how are you addressing it?
Mark Dentinger: Yes, we work closely with our suppliers and have throughout the cycle. I think fortunate for us, we didn't go down as far as many others in our peer group so I think we're pretty well positioned to handle it, but I say that and I know our procurement group has been working awfully hard to make that true, but we feel very confident of our ability to meet the ramp that we're seeing.
Mary – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that's helpful, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Hi, just to clarify, you guided gross margin up just slightly, yet revenue is growing over $100 million. I'm wondering are there some one-timers that you're not seeing margin leverage in December?
Mark Dentinger: No. We should get margin leverage, but we're coming off of a margin that's about 51.5%. We would guide it up slightly and again I think if you use our stated model of incremental gross margin leverage of 60% to 70% and you pencil that out against our revenue guide, that would be a reasonable expectation for margins in the next quarter which would be, I don't know, potentially two to three percentage points up. Maybe it's the word slightly. That's still a decent improvement.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Of course. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Another question on Reticle inspection. Considering that this order was for a new product, was it an evaluation tool which you recognized revenue in the current quarter too?
Rick Wallace: No. No.
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And so is the lead time still staying in the nine months kind of range for the Reticle inspection tools?
Rick Wallace: Well so you can imagine, Mahesh, that we've been working on Reticle tools and to some degree they are not all made to build based on the order so as we're bringing on new product we've been in the investment phase for our Reticle, which means building initial tools prior to necessarily having customers lined up so obviously, we have a number of tools we can ship, but yes, if you ordered a new one today then we haven't been talking then the lead time certainly takes a while to produce these tools. Does that make sense?
Mahesh Sanganeria – RBC Capital Markets: Yes, that makes sense. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. In your non-semi business, LED, data storage, HDD, is there anything storing there that could materially upside on top line for next year?
Mark Dentinger: We hope so. I mean, we've seen some good penetration in some of these markets and we think that there's a good growth but again as you know, they're coming off of relatively small numbers so on a relative basis compared with what can happen on the IC business, it's going to be hard to see it, but we do see steady growth and growth that's faster than industry average just where these new spaces are. So, yes, we do see some exciting prospects. We had some pretty good progress quarter-on-quarter, we were up pretty good in our non-semi and we anticipate another good bump in the December quarter off of non-semi.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: And can you comment on your appetite for acquisition in those segments or any other segments or you think you're in good shape for a while?
Mark Dentinger: I think that's right. I think we're in good shape for a while, I am pleased with the position we have with the acquisitions that we've done. We're almost through all the integration of those efforts, there's still a little bit more work to do, but we're pretty pleased with our platform and we think that we've got enough growth engines to move forward and execute on our long-term strategic plans with the products that we have in house today.
Atif Malik – Morgan Stanley: Thanks.
Operator: Your final question comes from Jagadish Iyer [ph] with RT Research [ph].
Jagadish Iyer – RT Research: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick. One is big picture question. How should we think about the process controlled market overall for 2010 given that there is strong technology reflections for memory as well as challenges at 40, 45-nanometer? And the second question is that on your order guidance for December, I just want to understand, where is the disconnect because your major foundry customers still have a decent amount of CapEx left in the fourth quarter and your guidance seems to be just flat plus or minus 10 so just maybe are you willing to conservative here, can you help us understand the dynamics here? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Sure, yes, so the first question was 2010. So if you model industry growth CapEx at 35 to 45 for calendar '10, our expectation is we would outperform that and our stated goal is to outgrow the industry by 5%. Based on all the analysis that we've done today we think that is still achievable and that's what we're shooting for. So while we don't know what the overall growth will be for the year, we do believe we're positioned to outgrow the industry. Relative to December and the guide being flat it is true we're flat. We're also flat off of a guide or performance that we're up 50% and so part of that was a phenomenon associated with the new product and the Reticle product as we broke out segments and Reticle, we had over $100 million of business. Now we don't believe that, that is a $400 million business in this current market environment so part of the effect that we had was a new product effect. So while we do see Reticle being strong we don't think it will remain at that level until we're in a full blown recovery. So we see increases in the other parts of the business that will offset getting to a more normalized level for Reticle, but the net of all that is we end up with a picture that looks like flat plus or minus on a range.
Jagadish Iyer – RT Research: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's conference. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Ed Lockwood for closing remarks.

On the website, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and investor conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2008, and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks. KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2008 Form 10-K, our subsequently filed quarter reports on Form 10-Q such as the report we filed for our quarter ended March 31, 2009, and our current reports on Form 8-K. We assume no obligation and do not intend to update those forward-looking statements. However, you could be assured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. Because we provided a strategic and business model update last week during our analyst briefing at SEMICON West, I'm going to keep my commentary brief and focus on a few key highlights of the fourth quarter and provide guidance for September. Then Mark will follow with a more detailed review of our financials for Q4 and for fiscal 2009. In general, the business environment today seems to have stabilized and visibility has improved with order activity focused primarily on technology buys and investment in the leading edge. New orders for June were $327 million, up 19% compared to March and at the upper end of the range of guidance, largely on the continued strength in the foundries and steady logic demand. Memory remained at lower levels as expected. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $282 million and non-GAAP loss per share, which we projected to be a loss of between $0.08 and $0.24, came in at $0.09 per share. We generated positive cash flow of operations in the fourth quarter of $73 million and we were cash positive for the year on the order of approximately $196 million. A good achievement in such a challenging economic and demand environment and a testimony to the discipline and focus of the KLA-Tencor team as we manage our way through this downturn. Mark will provide more details into the financial drivers in the quarter. But as demand stabilizes, we are encouraged to see improved margin and operating results in Q4, reflecting the benefit of new products and the revenue mix as well as continued discipline and good execution on the cost side. We remain focused on maintaining our cost discipline while sustaining a high level of investment in R&D to support our customers as they make their advanced technology investments. Now, I would like to provide our outlook for the September quarter. New orders in September are expected to be flat to up 20% compared with June. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $295 million to $335 million, and earnings ranging from a loss of $0.10 per share to breakeven. Consistent with that, we remain on track to achieve our breakeven objective by calendar year end. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats, one under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP and the other in a non-GAAP format which excludes amortization and write-downs of goodwill and intangibles assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock option investigation and related litigation, any other costs and expenses which we do not expect to be recurring such as restructuring charges. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in a GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will reference to the non-GAAP income statement but where I reference GAAP number, I will make the distinction. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at our corporate website at kla-tencor.com. Revenue for Q4 was $282 million within the range of guidance we provided in April of $270 million to $310 million and the non-GAAP loss per share was $0.09 at the favorable end of our guided range of an $0.08 to $0.24 loss per share. Our Q4 GAAP loss per share was $0.15. A summary of the differences between the Q4 GAAP and non GAAP numbers are as follows. Acquisition related charges of $12 million or $0.04 per share after taxes, restructuring and severance charges of $7 million or $0.03 per share after taxes, stock option related restatement related credits of $2 million which had a $0.01 per share of after-tax benefit this quarter. The improved order activity we experienced towards the end of Q3 continued into Q4 and although the environment is still challenging especially in the memory sector, new foundry orders for advanced production nodes drove Q4 orders to the top end of our guidance range. While we expect the remainder of calendar 2009 to be stable but not necessarily robust, we are satisfied the adoption of our new products and our continued market leadership coupled with the fiscal discipline we have exercised through this downturn have positioned us to capitalize on a sector rebound. New orders for Q4 were $327 million, an increase of 19% over Q3 and at the high end of our guided range of flat plus or minus 20% from last quarter's new bookings of 274 million. Approximately $67 million pushed out the 12 months delivery window resulting in net new orders of $260 million. We expect most of the push out orders to reenter our backlog over the next year. We ended the quarter with $518 million in total systems backlog after adjusting for push outs and foreign exchange impact. Backlog at fiscal year end included $186 million of revenue backlog or products that have been shipped and invoiced but have not yet been recognized as revenue and $332 million of system orders that have not yet shipped. We expect a majority of the unshipped backlog to ship over the remainder of the calendar year. The approximate regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter to quarter change in distribution was as follows. The US was 29% of new system orders in Q4, down from 43% in the March quarter. Europe had 4% of new systems orders up from 2% in Q3 of 2009. Japan was 4% down from 11% last quarter. Korea was 13% up from 9% last quarter. Taiwan was 46% up from 31% last quarter. And the rest of Asia was 4%, which was flat with Q3. The approximate Q4 distribution of new systems and services orders by product as well as the quarter to quarter change in distribution was as follows. Wafer inspection was 34%, up from 32% last quarter. Critical inspection was 10%, down from 17% last quarter. Metrology was 18%, up from 10% in the prior quarter. And solar, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 7% up from 2% last quarter. Service was 31% of new orders in Q4 down from 39% last quarter. Foundry customers comprised 53% of semiconductors systems orders in Q4 versus 40% in Q3. Logic and memory orders were 37% and 10% respectively in Q4 versus 46 and 14% in Q3. Technology purchases generated most of the activity with 45 nanometer and below development pilot activity comprising 97% of the semiconductor system orders received this quarter versus 95% in the March quarter. Although we are encouraged by the current order activity and the sales funnel for the September quarter, we are cautious about the intensity and duration of the recent upturn. As a result, we are assuming new orders in Q1 in the range of flat to plus 20% from Q4. Shipments in Q4 were $344 million, up 24% from 277 million last quarter. Systems revenue for Q4 was 176 million or 63% of total revenue versus 207 million or 67% of revenue in Q3. Services revenue in Q4 was 105 million or 37% of total revenue. Services revenue improved by 3 million from the prior quarter and strengthened as the quarter progressed. Our expectations for total revenue in Q1 is a range between 295 and 335 million. Non-GAAP gross margins was 46% in Q4, up eight percentage points from the March quarter, primarily because our Outlook for production plans for the reminder of calendar 2009 stabilized during Q4 and therefore we reported $18 million less in excess and obsolete charges than in Q3. In Q1, our gross margin percentage should remain flat or improve slightly from Q4. Operating expenses were $148 million, down $4 million from the March quarter. R&D was $78 million in Q4, up $1 million from Q3. And selling, general and administrative expenses or SG&A were $70 million, a $5 million decrease from last quarter. In Q1, assuming there are no significant additions required to our bad debt reserves, we anticipate that operating expenses would decline slightly from Q4 as the full quarter effect from our March staff r reduction should offset the impact of any higher variable compensation. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $11 million expense in Q4 or approximately $6 million higher than in Q3. The higher Q4 net expense was largely due to a nonrecurring gain on disposal of an investment and foreign exchange gains in the March quarter. In Q1, we expect net OIE to be approximately the same size as Q4. In Q4, our non-GAAP income tax benefit was $15 million or 50% of the Q4 pretax loss versus the $19 million charge in Q3. As I mentioned last quarter, we had a net expense in Q3 because of the $29 million charge in anticipation of a change to our California tax apportionment in fiscal 2012. Without the apportionment change, the Q3 tax benefit would have been $10 million or 26% of our pretax loss. Absent the apportionment charge, the increase in the tax benefit percentage from Q3 to Q4 was principally due to an increase in the asset value of deferred compensation plan, which is not taxable. As we have mentioned throughout 2009, lower negative pretax profits coupled with other unique factors each quarter make predicting short-term tax rates difficult but we continue to model a 30% rate for our September quarter and fiscal year 2010. Our non-GAAP loss was $15 million or $0.09 per share in Q4. These numbers include a pretax stock-based compensation expense of $26 million, a portion of our better than expected Q4 loss was due to the higher than modeled tax benefit of 50%. At our model rate of 30%, our non GAAP loss per share would have been $0.12. At the revenue range I've previously mentioned, we would expect Q1 non-GAAP operating results to be somewhere between breakeven and a loss of $0.10 per share, assuming a tax benefit of 30% and further assuming that there are no unanticipated charges required for customer collection issues or excess inventories. It is possible we could generate non-GAAP profit in Q1, especially at the higher end of our guided revenue range.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at 1.3 billion, an increase of $72 million quarter to quarter. Cash generated from operations of $73 million from Q4 versus $76 million in Q3. A component in arriving at the $73 million in operating cash we generated this quarter was a $26 million semiannual interest payment which we did not have in Q3. Net accounts receivables ended the quarter at $210 million, down $31 million from March 31. DSOs were 68 days at June 30th versus 71 days at the end of March. Net inventory decreased by $42 million last quarter and ended the quarter at $370 million. Net capital expenditures were 2 million in Q4 versus 3 million in Q3. Weighted average shares in Q4 were 170 million the same as in Q3. For the September quarter, we are expecting a slight loss so our weighted shares are expected to be about 171 million and no stock repurchases are anticipated this quarter. If we post a profit in Q1, the weighted shares will increase any diluted securities. Total headcount ended the quarter at 4,939, a net decrease of 463 from March 31. The decrease in Q4 largely occurred following the reduction in force action we took in late March. We expect that our headcount will decline slightly during Q1. We have continually spoken about our plan to reduce our quarterly operating expenses to the $142 million to $145 million range by our December 2009 and doing so should allow us to achieve non-GAAP breakeven operating margin on revenue of $300 million to $325 million. We have taken significant steps towards us achieving these spending targets and we anticipate that we will not require additional significant actions in order to achieve these levels. In summary, our guidance for Q1 is new orders are expected to be flat to plus 20% versus Q4. Total revenue between 295 million and 335 million Non GAAP loss per share will be between breakeven and $0.10 assuming a tax benefit of 30% of the pretax loss. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, Mark. We will now be happy to take questions and we once again request each participant to limit to one question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get to as many callers as possible in the time allotted today. And with that, operator we are ready for our first question.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from Citi. Your line is now open.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Rick, if I cut the numbers, and I look at your share of the overall WSE market that I can include service, I can strip it out, I can even exclude litho, if I cut it pretty much any which way, it shows that your share of the adoption of inspection if you will has basically flattened off the last five or six years. And I'm wondering if you're starting to outgrow the market, that is going to have to start to pick back up. So, I'm kind of wondering what if you go back and look the last five years, why did it slowdown, and the next five years why is it going to pick back up?
Rick Wallace: Hi, Tim. What we're seeing now certainly as we go through the 45 nanometer, 40 nanometer transition for our customers, we are definitely seeing an increased percent of spend on process control coming from our two customers. So when we look at the data, I think it depends on as you know Tim a lot of it depends on what part of the ramp we are in and I would say that as we look at it and as we see the indications happening now what has happened over the last several quarters, our business has held up better because I think that there is an increasing challenge from our customers. So we stick with our thesis that the 45 nanometer, 40 nanometer transition is tough and requires a lot of investment. And as we look forward, we don't see those trends abating as people go further in reducing their design rules. So I think a lot of this has to do with the data and analysis that you're looking at but that is certainly what we have seen.
Timothy Arcuri – Citi: Okay, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up from you, Rick, as you kind of look out to the second half of the year broadly, as foundries maybe have some moderating utilization as you get into Q4, I guess number one, do you even see that happening? And number two, if it does, do you think that there is enough kind of other business, memory, DRAM to basically offset that such that bookings can continue to grow through the rest of the year? Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Sure. When we look out certainly from a September perspective, we do see memory increasing as a percent of the overall, and so we guided flat up 20% for bookings for September. So we do see as a percent memory while not as robust as the logic or foundry segment overall, it will increase off the 10% base. December is still really hard to see what's going to happen in the December time frame. So I would say that we do see some return in memory to investment for technology transition but foundry still relatively stronger but down from the current levels. So we agree that foundry probably will not maintain its current rate of investment but will continue to invest in perhaps a little more balance with what we are seeing in memory. What we still don't see is real capacity investment for the rest of this calendar year. So we have some visibility in September. I think December is a tougher call because there are definitely other factors at work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: I guess first one just to piggyback on the memory question, you know rather than asking when you see that ramp, I guess can you talk about where your product tool record and when it does ramp, what kind of share you would anticipate in a recovery?
Rick Wallace: Sure. You know when we look around, I think our share inside memory looks pretty similar to what it is in the logic or foundry. They are kind of puts and takes depending on the product mix question that we have, the different products. So overall I think we will benefit from an increased investment in the memory side, similar to what we benefited in the logic and foundry, particularly because as we engage with the customers, we will definitely see pressure on yields and pressure on making the technology transition. So just as an example, C.J., when I look at September, we did 10%, it was basically the percent we did on memory in June, and we are modeling September in the 25% to 30% will be out of memory for us. So, it is increasing, but as I said, still not quite as healthy as what we're seeing in foundry. So I think overall share doesn't really suffer, we do see some come back, but again not for major capacity expansion in memory, more technology buys.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: That is helpful. And as my follow-up, you had a nice pickup there in gross margins in June and clearly within the guide here, you're now guiding it at 60%, 70% incremental, I guess as you look through the second half of 2009, what other kind of puts and takes, positive negatives, as you look at the business mix and you look at under absorption, increased absorption and how should we see gross margin pickup from here?
Rick Wallace: I will let Mark take that one.
Mark Dentinger: Yes. C.J., we did talk about gross margins being flat to slightly up entering into the September quarter. They could go higher depending on the mix. At this moment, if we don't have to make a capacity cut in terms of our manufacturing output, we shouldn't get any big negative surprises on the excess and obsolete front. We are still not fully utilized. We're headed towards that, and depending on the product mix and whatnot, that could give us some upside in the first half of the new fiscal year. So we continue to maintain that when we get back to more normal levels of business, that gross margin leverage should be there.
C.J. Muse – Barclays Capital: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Hi guys. Good afternoon. Thank so much for taking the question. Just a couple of quick ones. Could you talk about the dynamics within memory of NAND versus DRAM in Q3 and then potentially beyond that?
Rick Wallace: Sure. Again Q3 was I guess…
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: I mean calendar Q3 and beyond that, sorry.
Rick Wallace: So let me back up, so June quarter for us, our fiscal Q4, from our perspective, we saw NAND was – it is must half and half now, we're talking about small numbers, right. So we could see that continuing, so we have different dynamics at work from the memory, as you know, in the NAND overall, but from our mix about 50-50 for the June quarter and as I said, we see the overall percent going up slightly in September, maybe to more normal downturn levels, and we see the mix as we model it right now about 50-50 with the range of 25% to 30% of the new systems bookings being out of memory. So not a big difference between what is happening in DRAM and what is happening in NAND and I think some of that relates to the different dynamics. The NAND guys I think are – they are pushing the technology perhaps a little bit harder on the design rule standpoint but the memory guys are maybe a little bit further behind. So there's more people that need to transition on memory right now.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Are there any particular yield or diagnostic problems associated with DDR3, is that will be one of the drivers of the ramp up in the next of couple of quarters, is that just kind of normal course? Obviously it requires a lot of metrology of yield measurement and management, are there anything in particular there?
Rick Wallace: I think the issue there when I talk to customers is they have pressure I think because they are some capacity challenges around DDR3. I don't know Jim if you're seeing the same thing. So that in general they have a lot of capacity, in fact overcapacity in memory, but probably not enough on DDR3. So we are seeing a push to try to squeeze everything they can out. So from the standpoint of unique to the DDR3 design not so much but the need to make sure that they are optimizing, getting everything out of that. That is what we're seeing on the advanced DRAM side.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: That is very helpful. If I could just ask one more would be about the breadth of foundry orders, is it one, is it a broader both in terms of the June and then the September quarters and potentially beyond?
Rick Wallace: Yes, sure. It is not one, it is broader and I think that we had a couple of significant players, one smaller player in June and we see a broadening a little bit further in September. So I think that the foundry space in interesting because there seems to be more end demand driving that, and there is some unique challenges with the designs on the foundries. So we're seeing across the foundry space may be more pressure on utilization and a little more optimism from the perspective of end drivers.
Jim Covello – Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thank you so much.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Vis Vellore – Credit Suisse: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. This is Vis for Satya. The memory even though it is coming off of a low base, is it – do you see the increase coming from companies making the transition from 7X to 5X or is it more on the bigger players pushing down towards the 4X technology?
Rick Wallace: Yes, that is a good question. It is probably and as I said, you have a split between NAND and DRAM, so there are if you will 1X off right to start with and I think that probably mix inside of that is a little bit more biased to the bigger guys right now. I think some of the smaller guys still are having not investing at quite the same rate and I think September will be interesting to see how that actually plays out. Does that make sense?
Vis Vellore – Credit Suisse: Yes. And one quick follow-up is how should we think about services going forward with fab utilization rates kind of picking up? And also what percentage of orders in the June quarter was non semi?
Rick Wallace: Okay. Yes, so non semi in June was about 14% and service in June was 31% and we look forward and service will – we think it is off the bottom, will start growing again, but it'll take a little while to get back to its historic growth rates. So we see for example in the September quarter that it is up somewhat service as a percent probably holds right around the 30% range. So I think over time we saw utilization start picking up at the beginning of the calendar year and that followed on some serious business picking up in March/April/May time frame and we think it starts to climb from here but at a relatively slow rate. And the non semi stuff, it really depends on some of the end market dynamics. We had pretty good performance out of our non semi business and I think we see that continuing to grow as we move forward.
Vis Vellore – Credit Suisse: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up. First on the gross margin line, Q4 the gross margin looked pretty good, how much of that was a function of your cost reduction or product mix and also the fact that sources are so low that it kind of helps the gross margin boost up purely from a product front?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Let we just take it reverse. The eight point percentage point improvement quarter over quarter, you can bring it down to about six points of that was just lower EN&D [ph] charges. There is about a point of improvement due to capacity improvement which again gets into the fact that there were some staff reductions that affected us in the manufacturing area and about a point of it was mix. So you can think about that as sort of the bridging of Q3 to Q4 performance.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it. That is very helpful. Rick, can you give us an update on the dynamic you're seeing on your bare wafer product market and how do you seeing that trending over the second half and into 2010?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Chris, great question. I think bare wafer is for us certainly a capacity play and right now very little activity. We do have some product coming out, some new capability, customers who are interested, but at this point there is no investment for additional capacity, and we don't anticipate significant capacity investment happening through the rest of this calendar year. So we think that the bare wafer market will continue to be slow and is not really contributing to our gradual recovery here. But as we look forward to calendar 2010 we think that will be one of the components that kicks in for us as we see business start to get back to some capacity investment, but right now very slow.
Krish Sankar – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Rick Wallace: Thanks Krish.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you for taking my question. Mark, just a quick question here on guidance for the September quarter. It sounds like you're cautiously optimistic that actually at the high-end of the revenue range, you could actually do much better than the high-end of the EPS range, and it seems like it centered on gross margin. Could you just run over again I mean why the cautiousness in terms of gross margin guidance for September and by my math if you were to kind if drop through like you normally should 60% plus of the gross margin line on the EPS line, you should be somewhere around $0.03 to $0.05 at the high-end. So what…
Mark Dentinger: Yes Gary, it is several things. First of all, product mix is always a piece of the equation as it was this quarter as well. The other thing is the service versus product mix is also a contributor in there. And the final thing is that again any surprise on the EN&D front to the negative. We had a pretty good quarter in Q4. It would take at least a repeat of that to make sure that you're capturing all of the incremental margin that we talked about previously. But as they did indicate that there is room for that to be better and if that is better, that would be one of the drivers to get us to positive EPS. When I tell you that we are – you say cautiously optimistic, I would say cautious. If you come off of the last three quarters that we have had, you know you will learn not to get too far out ahead of yourselves in terms of guiding. But I did signal it does exist that upside scenario and we wanted to acknowledge it formally on the call.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then in terms of modeling, I mean KLA historically has been pretty predictable in terms of the 60% plus drop through on the gross margin, 50% plus drop through on the operating margin side. I mean does the model start to stabilize where we can predictably start to model that way in terms of drop through starting the December quarter or when do you think that will happen for KLA?
Mark Dentinger: Well, it may show itself as soon as the September quarter but we are certainly hoping that if the revenue and the bookings picture continues to improve throughout 2010 then that pattern will become very evident. But again we are just coming off the bottom right now and we are I guess cautiously optimistic is the words you used, we're feeling much the same way, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves either.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And Rick just a quick follow-up here, I think you get it – you are calling for basically stabilization in the current quarter pattern here in September and December. I think semi cap equipment companies fall into two camps, one about stabilization, one camp they fall into is really about further sequential order growth, what is kind of the difference between or dividing line between those views in the December quarter?
Rick Wallace: That is a great question. You know I look back and I say that there is – it probably goes to the philosophical view people have of the macro side of things. And historically I look back in the last several quarters, we have to the camp concept you have, there is a group that has been pretty optimistic throughout this cycle about overall growth, and I think anticipated something's happening. So March point, we're pretty a careful company. We look at the last several quarters and think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think there is no question in my mind we could respond to an upturn. So we're not doing anything that would preclude our ability, but on the other hand, I think after you go through the macro economic shock that we have been through, it is kind of hard to say that is all done and there is nothing else out there that can impact it and I think that that is probably at the basis of the different philosophies right now.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay great. And just a real quick housekeeping, did you guys guide to order percentage for memory in fiscal Q1 yet?
Rick Wallace: I did not. I talked a little bit earlier, it was about 10% we said in June, and we think it is 25 to 30%. It is not in the prepared comments, but we think 25% to 30% in the September quarter.
Gary Hsueh – Oppenheimer & Co.: Right, great. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay.
Operator:
Okay. :
Adam – UBS: Hi. This is Adam [ph] for Stephen Cheng. Could you please talk about the expected bookings linearity in the September quarter? Given that the expected bookings are better now, better than the historical trend, could we assume the visibility is better here than at the start of the September quarter compared to the end of the quarter?
Rick Wallace: Adam, it is a great question. I think we do have some pretty good indications because we're now engaged in conversations with customers that if I go back a few quarters earlier we didn't have this early in the quarter, and so we are talking about slots and trying to talk about support plans which is why we probably – we came out of SEMIWEST saying that we thought that we are going to flat to up. So I'd say that that is true and I think some of our customers have made more positive and affirmative commitments to investing at this phase of the quarter than we saw in the last few quarters. So I would say those are all the reasons why we don't get into linearity discussions per se. And as you know in this business, historically a lot of the stuff will happen at the end of the quarter, not necessarily exactly the case this quarter, partly because there is a scarcity of spots for people and so there are some people that had to move earlier to assure that they would make their commitments and ramp. Does that make sense?
Adam – UBS: Yes, absolutely. That is great. Also, could you share your thinking on how bookings will be broken out by quarter, broken out by geography, and also your outlook for 2010 capital spending trends for the industry?
Rick Wallace: Sure. I will start with by geography. We look forward, we think September is probably in the range of little bit down as a percent from this quarter so probably in the 25% for the US. Europe very small, so US and Europe maybe 28, last quarter they were a little bit over 30. Japan continues to be soft and so we are in the 5% range for that. Taiwan healthy but down so we're at 46% last quarter and we're seeing probably around 30%. And the rest of Asia is probably 17% to 20% and Korea is probably a little bit more like the 20%, which is up from where they were last. So we do see a little bit of shift as we look at the order book right now. For 2010, there are a lot of models out there, a lot of estimates. Internally this is maybe back to the earlier question I got on why is our conservatism more so than others. I think it is very hard to handicap CapEx without making a statement out about overall economic condition. So we have a range of up 20% to up 50% for next year and I think that as we roll out our targets, it is very dependent on I believe what happens overall economy. But from our standpoint, we see there is definitely upside in that range of 20 to 50 and we will know more about that as we get later into the year. But so much of that is about whether people are back investing in a meaningful way in capacity. Right now it is just we don't have visibility to that.
Adam – UBS: Okay, great. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Ho – Stifel: Thanks a lot. Guys, can you give a little bit color in terms of your 32 nanometer, within that 45 nanometer percentage you gave earlier, how much are you seeing on that technology node, especially as the logic guys begins to transition to that technology node?
Rick Wallace: Yes. You know Patrick it is hard to say because people are buying. We introduced some tools that are capable for 32 node, but 32 is really a development play by and large for people with maybe the exception of one customer. So I would say that it is still a relative small percent of the overall business is 32. But we do see interest in the R&D space for sure for that development. So I don't – we haven't really broken that out but I would say that the bulk of what we're seeing right now is related to the transition to the 45 nanometer and 40 nanometer nodes on the foundry side.
Patrick Ho – Stifel: Okay, great. And a follow-up question in terms of your cost cutting efforts and getting to your new breakeven target, a lot of those remaining I guess cost cuts are restructuring efforts targeted around your acquisitions or is it kind of mixed with your core businesses as well?
Rick Wallace: Yes, well, a good question (inaudible) completed at least if the world doesn't get any worse. So what we're talking about here is tweaking between now and the end of the year and then we get to announce previously that we had campus consolidation project here in the South Bay area that would kick in next year and give us a little more spending relief. But we don't at this moment, based upon today's business activities and the prospect that things aren't going to get worse from here, we don't have any major additional new cost reduction actions, and that would include both the acquired businesses and the extant businesses at KT.
Patrick Ho – Stifel: Right, thanks.

Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if what your de-booking status is today, is that improving, were there less discussions about de-bookings in the current period?
Mark Dentinger: Yes. The de- bookings are a function of whether or not orders actually slip out of what we think is a 12 month delivery window. And that is through discussions with customers, are you inside or outside the 12 month delivery window? And the reason that they are important is that in terms of sizing manufacturing capacity and where we have to ramp, that is the window we look at in terms of having to have capacity ready. So it is not unusual to see towards the end of the cycle that customers clarify whether or not they want to pull tools in as Rick indicated or whether or not they want to push a little bit further out and the de-bookings numbers essentially are a function of that. I should also clarify that the vast majority of those are not true de-bookings. They are basically rescheduling in or rescheduling out of existing orders.
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: But bottom line, you don't expect an increase in activity, essentially it is very little de-bookings going on today?
Rick Wallace: You mean with respect to the September quarter?
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Yes.
Rick Wallace: I would guess that the de-booking number will probably go down in September again based upon current business trends.
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Okay. One last question with regards to your bookings rate, your bookings is – excuse me, your shipments rate was pretty strong this quarter. And I think this is the first time your statements rate is running ahead of your shippable backlog number, and I was wondering if you could provide some comments about how you feel about shipping above your quarterly – your backlog number?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Maybe even the more important statistic is that we shipped ahead of revenue for the first time in eight quarters this quarter, back to our fiscal Q1 2008. So that again is a positive indicator. With respect to the shippable backlog number, that will go up and down depending on exactly what happens towards the end of the quarter, but there is no doubt that that trended up very, very nicely this quarter, and if that continues, that is a good sign.
Peter Kim – Deutsche Bank: Thank you.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. You line is now open.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Hi guys. This is Casey [ph] calling for Mahesh. A couple of quick questions. When do you guys expect capacity buys to come in from DRAM and NAND makers?
Rick Wallace: We don't – I tell you what we don't expect, and we don't expect them over the next September quarter or December we think we will see much. Maybe at the end of December, depending on how the view of the market is, we might see some activity there. But as I talk to customers in the memory space, they don't anticipate making significant capacity investments the rest of this calendar year. So that is not any of our models and as I talked earlier, that is really I think the swing factor in what kind of calendar tenure the industry has in general. So I would say not for the next couple of quarters but assuming a normal economic kind of recovery in the environment, then we would see them starting in the calendar 2010.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. During the NAND conversion to 3X, can you talk a little bit about process control challenges?
Rick Wallace: Yes, sure. I think there are a number of challenges. In that case, people are really pushing design rules harder than in any other technology node. And from that perspective alone there are certain defect types that our customers are really struggling just to find. We have introduced the new Brightfield tool, we talked about for example at SEMICON West, last week we talked about it. And that we are seeing in R&D that that is providing unique value for customers to find unique defects that will impact them as they go to 3X. So in that case we anticipate demand increasing for our new Brightfield, our new Darkfield, our new review tool on the defect side and then metrology also is getting pushed pretty hard as well. So that is part of our analysis of why we see growth in process control as we move forward. New defect types, some are just associated with the structures, but some are just absolute size issues that there has been no other way to see them and until we get to that node, it hasn't really impacted our customers yield, but it will at 32 – I mean the 3X in general.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: And lastly in the RIG [ph] business segment, where are we on the order cycle with the mask shops, are they ordering tools in anticipation of tech upgrades?
Rick Wallace: I think there has been some activity. We talked about in the mask world that March was a regional percentage of overall bookings, about 17%. It dropped a little in June but we anticipate it popping back up in September. Our new technology needs but also we have some new product capabilities we will bring into the market and there is a strong interest in that from our customers. We just need to work through finishing and delivering those early tools. But it is driven on new technology and as we look forward, we expect the radical shops, the mask shops will renew their investment which frankly they took several quarters of very low investment as they just didn't see the needs from a capacity or technology standpoint. But we're at a position now where we have had new capability and they have got some new challenges.
Casey – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Rick Wallace: Thank you. I want to make one final comment for our fiscal 2009. Yes, this is certainly challenging year and we know it won't be the last time the semiconductor industry suffers a downturn. But 2009 for us was a year that allowed us to demonstrate the strength of our technology and our people in the face of what may well be the steepest industry downturn. KLA-Tencor earned a non-GAAP operating profit in FY 09 and generated about $200 million in cash flow from operations. We fully paid our dividend and we built upon our market leadership. So I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, our customers, and our suppliers for supporting us, and we're certainly looking forward to a better fiscal 2010. Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-04-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Abigail, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, Abigail. Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to KLA-Tencor's third quarter fiscal year 2009 financial results conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial officer. We're here today to discuss third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2008. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website, at www.kla-tencor.com, or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today's call with updates on the current market environment and the company's performance in the March quarter and provide guidance for the June quarter. Afterwards, Mark Dentinger will review the preliminary financial results for the quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions. A simulcast of this call will be accessible on-demand following its completion on the Investor section of our website. On the website, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and investor conferences, as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended June 30, 2008 and our subsequently filed 10-Q reports. In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on this call today are subject to those risks. And KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking results. More information regarding factors that could cause those differences is contained in the filings we make with the SEC from time to time, including our fiscal year 2008 Form 10-K as well as our subsequent Form 10-Q and 8-K filings. Although we make no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you could be assured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us for our call today. I'll lead off with a brief overview of highlights for the quarter, and provide commentary on what we're seeing in the marketplace today and guidance for the fourth quarter. And Mark will follow with further details on the financial results, and finally will conclude with the questions. First, my perspective on some highlights for the quarter. KLA-Tencor met our bookings in revenue guidance in the third quarter, despite continued weakness in the global economy and very low levels of demand in the semiconductor equipment market. Our results show we're adapting well in this tough environment and successfully managing our business in a climate where visibility continues to be poor. And demand beyond the near-term remains very difficult to predict. Revenue in the third quarter came in above the mid-point of guidance, at $310 million. The non-GAAP net loss per share, including stock-based compensation, but excluding some one-time items with a loss of $0.34 in Q3. This net loss figure includes about $0.18 per share related to a charge for state taxes that we took in the quarter. Excluding the tax charge, loss per share would have been better than guidance in Q3. As operating expenses were lower in the quarter than our original outlook. As previously announced in March, we took action to adjust our cost structure, to lower business levels we're expecting over the near and intermediate term, and to position the company to meet our breakeven target. But notwithstanding our emphasis on managing costs, we're continuing to focus on our customers, and sustaining a high level of investment in R&D, maintaining a prolific pace as new product introduction which will better position KLA-Tencor to extend our lead in our core market, and to benefit from future growth. Turning to the March quarter demand picture. New orders in Q3 were above the mid-point of the range of guidance in the quarter at $274 million, an increase of approximately 13% over the December quarter. The new order activity that we saw in the March quarter was driven by leading edge customers investing in their advance design nodes to support an improving demand environment for advanced devices. While we are encouraged by the technology orders that we receive, it's important to point out that they were limited to a small number of customers. Based upon what we saw on March and what we anticipate for the rest of the calendar year, 2009 capital investments appear to be primarily focused on technology development, with significant capacity investments not anticipated until 2010. Given the focus on advanced technology, we continued to model overall CapEx to be down in calendar year 2009, somewhere in the range of down 45 to down 50% of 2008. KLA-Tencor is well-positioned in the technology-focused demand environment industry, when capacity investment resumes. Now let's turn to some items in Q3 and development for the quarter. As I -- $4 million, an increase of approximately 13% over the December levels. Investment in Q3, will primarily focused on foundry and logic advanced design rules. Logic was relatively strong in Q3 with 46% of the order coming from this market. We expect to see continued investment in logic in the near-term. Foundry investments in Q3 were approximately 40% of our orders. Our foundry customers invested probably across our products for their next generation wafer need, reticle and metrology product in order support advance design rule around. We expect foundries to continue to invest in the near-term as well. Normally remained flat of the very low December levels, as the industry continues to process a gradual rationalization of excess capacity and the sort out issues coming from ongoing consolidation and constraint on investment capital. In general, we see private memory investment of largely a timing issue. We expect memory investment in advanced technology development to resume in due course in the second half of calendar 2009. However in the near-term, we expect the technology investment to be limited to market leaders. Overall, while the business environment is certainly challenging and likely to remain so. We are seeing leading customers making technology investments to support the next generation product development efforts. We're encourage by this activity and believe this trend is likely to continue over the course of the next few quarters. Now, I'd like to take a minute to highlight some of the benefit we're seeing from executing on our customers focus objectives in today's market environment. In the climate where many competitor are survival mode, investment and innovation remains a top priority to KT. It brings us closer to the customer. It extends our competitive advantage and it strengthens our leadership position as a trusted technology partner in this very challenging business environment. Our continuing commitment to making high levels of investment is a key element of our approach to the market in this downturn, and it's critical towards the sustained success in the future. In fact, as the current downturn drives on, we find we're engaging even more closely than ever with our customers, and enjoying a generally more collaborative environment in the marketplace as our customers are placing a heightened emphasis on their suppliers' ability to deliver future roadmaps in these tough times. Now I also believe, we measure our success in customer focus by our market share. And while it's natural for customers to evaluate alternatives to ensure that their investment is well set, we will try to maintain our market leadership position in the market that we serve. We collaborated closely with our customers. We continued to invest in innovating our products. And we've executed well in our product introduction process. The buying decisions made by our customers have validated our approach. We once again find ourselves building upon our market strength in our core market, while at the same time making share gains in market, where we have historically have lower share likely being review. In addition to the strength of our current product offerings, we believe we're significantly out investing our competitors, and we'll be in a position to bring new products to the market more quickly over the next few quarters. At close customer collaborations and conjunction with our upcoming new products will serve us well as the market recovers. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to provide our guidance for the fourth quarter. Given the uncertainty in the market, forecasting continues to be challenging in this environment. As mentioned earlier, calendar year 2009 appears to be focus on technology investments, but only a subset of our customers are able to invest in the near-term. For specifics on guidance, new orders in June are expected to be flat compared with March, plus or minus 20%. Revenues are expected to be between $270 million and $310 million with the non-GAAP loss per share in the range of a loss of $0.08 per share to a loss of $0.24. I'll now turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark.
Mark P. Dentinger: Thanks Rick. As most of you know, we present our income statement in two formats, one under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs of goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options investigation and related litigation, and any other costs and expenses, which we do not expect to be recurring such as restructuring charges. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented in GAAP format only. Most of my prepared remarks on operations will reference to non-GAAP income statements. For our reference to GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at out our corporate website at kla-tencor.com Revenue for Q3 was $310 million, at the high end of the guidance, we provided in January of 280 to $320 million, and other -- and the non-GAAP loss per share was $0.34 at the low end of our guidance range of 20 to $0.35 loss per share. The larger than anticipated loss was affected by $29 million tax charge following a change in California, this quarter. Without this charge our non-GAAP taxes for Q3 would have been a $10 million benefit reducing our non-GAAP loss per share to $0.17. Our Q3 GAAP loss per share, including a four mentioned tax charge was $0.49. The summary of the differences between the Q3 GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are acquisition-related charges at $17 million or $0.06 after taxes. Stock option restatement related charges is $2 million or $0.01 per share after taxes and restructuring and severance charges of $19 million or $0.07 per share after taxes. While Q3 was similar to Q2 in several respects, there were signs that business is stabilizing, As Rick indicated, although the environment is extremely challenging and visibility remains low, technology buys for advance reduction from key customers drove orders to the top end of our guidance range. In spite these difficult circumstances our market leading position remained strong, as we continue addressing our customers complex yield challenges at advanced node. New orders for Q3 were 274 million, an increase of 13% over Q2 and it's a high-end of our guided range are flat, plus or minus 20% from last quarter's new booking of 243 million. Approximately $28 million of customer initiated shipment delays pushed out of the 12 month window, resulting in net new orders of $246 million. We expect most of the pushed out orders to reenter our backlog in the next six to nine months. We ended the quarter with $543 million in total systems backlog after adjusting for customer initiated delays and foreign exchange impact. The backlog at March 31, 2009 included $127 million of revenue backlog, for products that have been shipped in invoice but have not yet been recognized its revenue and $416 million in product orders that have not yet shipped. We expect a vast majority of the unshipped backlog, to ship over the remainder of the calendar year. The approximate regional distribution of newer systems orders when the quarter-to-quarter change regional distribution was as follows. U.S. was 43%, of new system orders in Q3, down from 64% in the December quarter. Europe was 2% down from 7% in Q2 of '09. Japan was 11% down from 22% last quarter, Korea was 9%, versus no new systems orders last quarter. Taiwan was 31% versus 3% last quarter, and the rest of Asia was 4% same as we reported in Q2. The approximate Q3 distribution of new system and services orders by market as well as the quarter change in market distribution was as follows: Wafer inspection was 32%, up from 22% last quarter. Reticle inspection was 17%, up from 8% last quarter, metrology was 10% down from 15% in prior quarters, and, storage, solar high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 2%, down from 7% last quarter. Services was 39% of new orders in Q3, down from 48% last quarter. Where technology purchase is generating most of the activity this 45-nanometer and below development and pilot activity was roughly 95% of the semiconductor systems orders received in the quarter. This level is up from 70% at December quarter. While some key business indicators improved during March. We are cautious about the intensity and duration of the improvement. As a result, we are continuing with plans to reduce our operating expenses and we are assuming new orders in due course in the range of flat plus or minus 20% from Q3. Shipments in Q3 was $277 million, down 15% from the $327 million in the December quarter. Looking at our income statement, systems revenue for the quarter was $207 million or 67% of total revenue versus $273 million or 59% of revenue in Q2. Our services revenue in Q3 was a $102 million or 33% of total revenue. Services revenue declined $21 million or 17% from the prior quarter as lower utilization rates by several customer to suspend service contracts and idle tools in response to the downturn. Our current expectations for total revenue in Q4 is a range of 270 to $310 million. Non-GAAP gross margins was 38%, down eight percentage points from the December quarter, primarily due to lower revenue levels and additional reserves for excess inventories. These factors were partially offset by a stronger systems mix and lower labor cost following our Q2 restructuring. In Q4, we expect to improve our gross margin percentage assuming build plan stabilize and therefore additional reserve requirements the niche. The gross margin improvement resulting from more stabled build plan should more than offset the affect to slightly lower revenue levels. Operating expenses were $152 million down $47 million from the December quarter. R&D was $77 million in Q3, down $12 million from December. And selling. general and administrative expenses or SG&A were $74 million, a $35 million decrease from the last year. The quarter-over-quarter operating expense changes were largely due to lower average head count in all areas of the company, including both; R&D and SG&A, following our staff reductions in November. These actions reduced our employee expenses by about $17 million from the prior quarter. Lower project material spend, as a number of key development programs move into ... Alpha and Beta test basis. And in Q2, we recorded a $24 million increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect collection concerns about certain customers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In Q3, no new bad debt charges were required to the SG&A expense comparison was favorably impacted. And in Q4, assuming there are no significant additions required to our bad debt reserves, we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease by approximately 3 to $5 million in Q3 as we've realized the partial effect from our March cost reduction measures. Other income and expense or OIE was a net $5 million expense for Q3, were approximately $6 million lower than we expected due to a non-recurring gain on disposal of an investment in foreign exchange gains. These favorable factors were partially offset by lower yields on our cash and marketable securities portfolio. OIE with the $12 million expense in the fiscal Q2, in part due to a $4 million charge against our venture investments. In Q4, we expect net OIE to return to the 10 to $11 million expense range. In Q3, our non-GAAP income tax expense was $19 million charge, versus a 29% benefit or an $8 million credit last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the Q3 tax expense resulted largely from a $29 million charge based on our anticipated election to change our California income tax a portion that methodology in fiscal 2012. This anticipated change in the portion that required us to reduce our deferred tax assets this quarter, but the change will not have much impact on our long-term tax rate. As we have discussed in prior calls, lower negative pre-tax profits, mix of business and changes in governmental factors, make predicting short-term tax rate difficult. But we do expect our long-term rate to be about 30%, and we are modeling a 30% benefit for our June quarter. Our non-GAAP loss of $58 million or $0.34 per share in Q3. These numbers includes stock-based compensation expenses of $23 million and the weighted share to compute the loss per share were 170 million. At the revenue range, I previously mentioned, we would expect a Q4 non-GAAP loss of 8 to $0.24 per share, assuming a tax benefit of 30% and further assuming that there are no unanticipated charges required for customer collection issues or excess inventory. On a GAAP basis, we also recorded a $17 million pre-tax charge in Q3 associated with the March reduction enforce, which will lower our head count by about 10% over the remainder of calendar 2009. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments including long-term marketable securities ended the quarter at 1.3 billion, an increase of $35 million quarter-to-quarter. Cash generated from operations was $76 million in Q3 versus $36 million used in operations during Q2. We also used $25 million in Q3 to pay our dividend. The net $112 million quarter-over-quarter improvement in operating cash included the benefit of an income tax refund of about $40 million. Significant declines in receivables in growth inventory, and in fact that our $26 million semiannual interest payments on our long-term debt occurred in our second and fourth quarter. Net account receivables ended the quarter at $241 million down $91 million from December 31, 2008. DSOs were 71 days at March 31 versus 76 days at the end of December. As I noted, there were no additional charges for bad debt expense during Q3. Net inventory decreased by $61 million from last quarter and ended the quarter at $412 million. Portion of the decrease in the balance resulted from $32 million from new charges for except material. Net capital expenditures were $3 million in Q3 versus $7 million in Q2. The weighted-average shares in Q3 were 170 million versus a 169 million in Q2. For the June quarter, we are expecting another loss, our weighted-average shares are expected to be about 171 million and no stock repurchases are anticipated this quarter. Total head count ended the quarter at 5,402 a net decrease of 492 from December 31. The decrease in Q3 largely occurred following the reduction hence forth we took in late November to the large portion of the impacted in place came off this April in late January. We expect our head count will decline during Q4 as a result of our March reduction. In our October and January calls, we now plan to reduce our quarterly operating expenses to the 140 to $145 million range, prior December quarter and doing so would allow us to achieve breakeven operating margin on revenue of 300 to $325 million. We took significant steps during Q3 towards these spending targets and we currently anticipate that we will not require additional significant actions in order to reach these operating expense levels. In summary, our guidance for Q4 is, new orders are expected to be flat plus or minus 20% versus Q3. Total revenue between 270 and 310 million, assuming a tax benefit of 30% of the pre-tax loss. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over the Ed to begin Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thanks Mark. We're now ready to take your questions and we've once again request each participant to limit one question and a brief follow-up to allow us to get as many callers as possible in the time allotted today. With that Abigail, we're ready for our first question.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line Brett Hodess with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Brett Hodess: Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. Two questions, Rick it looks like your wafer inspection and reticle inspection orders actually grew quite strongly, sequentially versus the other businesses. And obviously technology driven but can you tell us if that sequential growth was new product driven? Or was it tied to a specific technology node, and was there share gain in those areas?
Richard Wallace: Sure, Brett. I guess it's really related to the investment we saw fundamentally in advance design which is as we said most of what's going on right now. But we believe that our share positions very strong. I think that in this environment there is a bit of flight-to-quality by our customers where there, they got to make sure their investment dollars are optimized and our new products are showing very well. Plus remember, we've continue to invest in our product development through the cycle. So these are advanced products that are coming out. So we're seeing them being leveraged for the advance design rule work and at the same time, we're very strong from market share perspective.
Brett Hodess: And then a follow on to that was when you look at the product mix these are usually your best margin products. So are you seeing the margins being maintained on a -- you have under absorption issues but are the margins being maintained on a product specific basis and you particularly pointed out like e-beam review which you're gaining share and does that have the kind of margins as the other inspection and products out?
Richard Wallace: Right as you know, we don't breakout by product roughly, but its clear in the market areas where we're stronger, we benefit from relative volume and so I would say that once we reach a normalized level we're in the same margin range that we've been in the past but we have some NAND absorption going on right now. So, we're pleased with our margins, at the same time we have a customer base, a very mindful of value. So, our pricing strategy; well, we've not really reduced prices in this environment but we've maintained margins equivalent to what we've had in the past. The newer products like review where we have made some good share gains still have smaller volumes. So the margins there are going to be less, and we've got longer-terms plans as we ramp our shares there to improve margins on those products.
Brett Hodess: Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Thanks, Brett.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi. Your line is open.
Junaid Ahmed: Yes, hi. This is Junaid Ahmed calling-in for Tim. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question Rick, with the respect to your sales available market, could you kind of quantify how that's growing over the past several years with your entry into market and all the acquisitions that you've done, kind of maybe on a percentage basis?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, sure, it's hard to quantify that in this current market, given the overall level of demand that's going on. But when we outlined the acquisitions. I'd say probably three to four quarters ago, we talked about in the range of 600 to maybe $900 million available plan (ph) that's opened up to us in a more normalized environment. I would still say that true. Much of that's dormant right now. And we're not seeing a lot of business in those segments based on overall macroeconomic situation.
Junaid Ahmed: And my second question, regarding margins. If I look to way your revenues dropped in the last cycle, it was kind of around the same 300 million range. And at that level the margins were almost 7 to 800 basis points higher than it is this quarter. Even accounting for this like higher service revenue that you have now, could we -- is that -- are we -- should we like be modeling like some permanent degradation over there?
Mark Dentinger: No, we've done an analysis and I think it's really important to make sure that you're looking at comparable points and comparable data. So, we go back to March '03, and that looks like a similar level of revenue. And I'd say that the way we model is there is about 200 basis points difference, once we get the cost out that we've modeled by the end of the year. So if you took our revenue now and our cost structure, we'd have by the end of the year, there is a couple 100 basis points between the two. So pretty close, and then there is additional cost reduction structure that we think will get out. So, we think it's within 100 basis points apples-to-apples comparison, because, for example; you have share-based comp now, you didn't have at then. And so, there are some other factors when you look to net income with OIE. where we're making servicing debt now. And we are getting income then. So, apples-to-apples on profit from operations, we think it's probably 100 basis points. And again it allow us to access significantly market overall. So, we think that's a reasonable position to be in.
Junaid Ahmed: So, if revenue goes like into 400 million range, what type of gross margins would you be kind of thinking?
Mark Dentinger: Well, from where we are today, our system margins are still pretty good. We get hit with the NAND in the current environment. So part of what's happening is we have an absorption problem. But, we think the incremental gross margin on the way back up will be similar what it's been in the past, which is to 60 to 70% range. To be normalize that we had a 65%. So we see margins actually pretty consistent with what we've seen in the past.
Junaid Ahmed: Okay.
Mark Dentinger: I mean, on an operating basis, it's good. Obviously, service at a lower level as a larger percent of the whole dilutes the gross margin, but doesn't necessarily dilute the operating margins.
Junaid Ahmed: All right. Okay, thank you.
Richard Wallace: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
CJ Muse: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for taking my question. I guess Rick, first question on the order guidance, that off the net or gross number and in terms of 110 million delta I guess off of the growth. Can you comment on what's driving the volatility there?
Richard Wallace: It's often growth. So, why such a large range, is that the question?
CJ Muse: Yeah, I mean, is there one or two specific projects that moved in or out that's driving there?
Mark Dentinger: Well, when we look back CJ, we look back to our visibility back in the beginning of January. And what actually happened during the course, I'd say we -- it was pretty clear there is low visibility. So we anticipated that visibility continues to be low and the volatility continues to be high, which is the reason for that range. Our view is, if there are technology investments made then we will continue to do well and in fact we'll gain a pretty good percent of the overall CapEx. But volatility on bookings I think in this environment is wise is to have a big range. That what we said was basically flat from the gross level.
CJ Muse: Okay. And then I guess you talked about in your prepared remarks about a recovery in the second half for tax spending on the memory side. Is that primarily DRAM NAND both, any color there would be helpful?
Richard Wallace: Sure. They're both as you know they're both pretty suppressed right now. So we're seeing the technology advance really on both sides, but it's clear that DRAM has been even more dormant, and right now I think that if there is going to be multiple players they're going to have to invest in technology to get ahead. So I think we'll see some of the both. But again we're talking second half and that's the way is out. But what's clear and I was in Asia last couple weeks as you talked to customers they clearly want to make the technology investments but it's a challenge, its been a challenge to get funding. We've seen some recent signs lately that we think some of that's going to come around, but they still have over capacity situation in memory.
CJ Muse: And I could just sneak in one last question. Can you provide an update yes on success of XR mass inspection tool. What kind of feedback you're getting from customers?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, sure. What you saw was reticle was 17% last quarter, so was we've have not introduced new product which is coming so it's all on existing products. So I would say we did very well from a share basis and that s obviously the existing product line. So we're real pleased with that performance and frankly didn't necessarily anticipate in this quarter but we saw some technology bias coming in. So we think from a share standpoint we're right where we want to be with reticle and we've got new products coming out.
CJ Muse: But I guess can you update on the new products?
Richard Wallace: Well, not until we release and we've announced the XR as you said. So, that one I'd say is doing well and then my point is in the pipeline there is more coming.
CJ Muse: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah, hi this is Riz (ph) for Satya. One quick question what was your deferred revenue in the quarter?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, we don't breakout -- we have two lines, we have deferred revenue from services contracts that we actually do breakout and display and that number at the end of the quarter were $61 million. And then we also have deferred systems profit which nets down the deferred revenue system sales against the deferred cost on system sales, which turned out to be about $74 million worth of deferred profit at March 31.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then for your services, how are you looking at with the utilization rates improving, how are you seeing service levels for the rest of the year like over -- for calendar year '09 as compared to '08?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah I think what's interesting is we've seen I think the rate of decline has stopped in terms of utilization, and as you know some utilization numbers are up. So the leading indicators are things that we track, we've seen such stabilization and we suspect that some of the tools that have gone off contract will come back on contract. So we're modeling as we look out over the year gradual increase in service, but I'd say slow and steady increase of the current level. So we suspect to be probably bottomed on service revenue in the March quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: And one last thing, how are you seeing your non semi business, I think you introduce a solar inspection during the quarter and where do you see that?
Mark Dentinger: With a lot of growth opportunity in the non-semi, as that as semi has been, the solar stuff, has really slowed down quite a bit, I think the solar industry grappled up with some funding challenges and credit challenges, from a market share position we are very well-positioned, but we do see relatively small lot of activity, lot of interest but not a lot of buying yet. So, we anticipate part of what we'll see when that activity resumes, is good growth out of those segment.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Dentinger: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Covello: Great, good afternoon guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. One main question for me, I'm just trying to compare a little bit or get away to think about your orders and order guidance versus some of the others in the industry. And I know this is always is difficult exercise. On one hand you guys came in much higher on sequential basis in March. On the other hand, June your fiscal year-end, it is mostly technology buying that's going on. And, you have very good exposure that one of the biggest customers that's ordering right now from a technology perspective. Do you had some of the other companies guide up pretty meaningfully from an order perspective for the June quarter. So how do you think we can reconcile all that a little bit?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, Jim. Good question. I think it's hard to speak for what the other guys are doing. We look at it and think if there is investment, we'll continue to reap the benefit of that because of as you said, we're well-positioned. And I think our market share is very strong and we've got new products and the offering that our customers need. From that standpoint, I'd say we're well-positioned. I suppose if we had been down quite a ways, then we'd have to be talking about it going up. So, we're look at environment where we think it's relatively flat for the calendar year. And so if there is upside, you're right, June is the end of our quarter. But I've been careful on this cycle not to try to map back to historical patterns because it's just such a different world we're in.
Jim Covello: And then the only other question some of the other companies, and again, I know your dynamics can be quite a bit different at times from there. Some of the other companies are talking about some technology buying from the memory companies also. Whereas you're talking about that kind of may be in the second half. Again, is there some possibility that comes in June, or do you think there is some dynamic relative to how these companies are adding some capacity that would potentially cuts your orders from some of the memory guys to come in the quarter later?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, I characterize it this way. If it happens, it's upside for us. If it happens I think some of those may might need it to make their plan.
Jim Covello: Great. All right, thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cohen & Company. Your line is open.
Raj Seth: Hi, thank you. Hey Rick, historically, you've described your opportunity in good times and dollar per fab kind of metric. In this kind of environment, is there -- are there any metrics that you use to think about what you're opportunity is, and our fab that's moving from one technology, and I'll say 65 to 45, how much we used to the toolset exist. How much of an opportunity is there, fab that's moving from one node to another but not adding a lot net capacity?
Richard Wallace: Right. Yeah, that's a great question. It's a little bit harder to model in this environment as you know. And we have done some of those models, when you look at what is, for example; a 10,000 wafer start conversion look like in terms of the number of tools. But, since there has not been a pattern established of that, it's kind of hard to come off with a model that we can really back up, because we don't have any history on it. I would say that the pattern that we've just seen. In the last couple of quarters where I think our bookings have held up significantly better than peers is in the other parts of the equipment, suggest that our pieces of the investment, process control inspection metrology, 45 and below is going to be a larger percent of the overall time. And so I think as companies are focused on technology. Obviously, yields is critical to them and getting it to work. So, what we're looking at now is how do we, from an absolute dollar standpoint capture, a larger percent of the spend that's going on. And that's really where our focuses is, is trying to help our customers understand of the industry and our capability that we offer them that minimize the need for additional capital in other areas.
Raj Seth: In this environment the people take sampling rates up or down?
Richard Wallace: Well, certainly with new technologies, they've taken them up, because I think what they're recognizing is that they're struggling with some of the yields. And we're seeing that across the board both memory and DRAM and for NAND but also we certainly saw in logic, and that was part of what drove our order activity in the March quarter.
Raj Seth: And one last quick one if I could, the mix shift that Brett was talking about at the beginning of the call towards reticle, et cetera. Would you expect that to continue is in this technology by environment the mix going to shift in any particular way between your sort of three measures dimension or not.
Richard Wallace: I would attribute that probably we're more heavily weighted towards inspection, both; in reticle and wafer. And probably towards some of the tools that are more oriented toward the characterization and development activity, unless towards the tools that are more orient toward capacity. I say that's probably through the metrology is very critical. Bit, some of that does play more in a ramp environment.
Raj Seth: Great. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Thank you, Seth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twig with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Weston Twig: Hi, guys, Just a question on an upcoming technology shifts that the NAND companies are expected to use double patterning technology, which should drive increased with their metrology needs. And I'm just wondering if there is any difference in the metrology requirements if they use a space or double patterning process versus like a ramps (ph). And to follow-up, the NAND customers starting to talk to you now about ordering tools for the 32-nanometer ramps?
Richard Wallace: Sure. On both counts is first one the metrology needs on double patterning vary probably more from the optical CD standpoint and they do from an overlay perspective. In both cases overlay requirements are very tight. The optical CD have some different characteristics whether it's in floater (ph) or edge. So, I'd say there is opportunity incremental opportunity there. In terms of, are they talking to us absolutely what I think will be interesting to see is when they actually start to release capital. But, right now they've been very conservative in there spends for various reasons. We are seeing increased discussion but we just haven't seeing the orders out.
Weston Twig: Okay. And then just one more question, kind of coming back to where you said if you get a lot of 300 millimeter second hand equipment on the market. I'm wondering is the large portioning of that if its KLA inspection metrology equipment. Is that reusable or is it upgradeable or is it do customers really need to come in and buy a new version of tool KLA.
Richard Wallace: Right. So this part of our strategy, I'm focusing heavily our new product introduction was to, try to avoid that issue and so our newer tool have better cost on their share more capability. And so our view is that in most of our markets will be protected from some of that second hand tool. We have had a used tool business. We continued to do that, I would say that is the business that gets impacted by this trend which I think it's a real trend but that constituted maybe a couple percent of our business in the past. So we don't think it's a major impact. But for sure I think for capacity buys, for process equipment that's a risk. I think less so for process control.
Weston Twig: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Gary Hsueh: I was wondering if you could talk about gross margin, particularly relative to our original expectations, because when I look at my model you guys definitely overachieved in terms of ratcheting down operating expenses. I was expecting something like a $117 million. But you guys turn in something much lower but on a 170 million, I was expecting gross margin of around 39-40%. You guys came in with 38%. Am I reading too much in this or gross margin -- even relative to your own expectations?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, no I think, the gross margins really paid the price for the speed in which the ramp has come down and I think, there what that means is the NAND. So, when we look at actual system margin and we strip out the inefficiencies in the operation right where we've historically been. I think what happens in this environment that your caught with more material than you needed because the rate of the decline and so, that part have what we are working through now. That will abate over time and see; you see margins go up just as a result of that comes off and we don't get hit with those charges, Mark any color to that?
Mark Dentinger: No. That's, that's essentially, Gary. The reality is that when we ended the quarter we were hoping for stable bill plans we had to take them down early in the quarter, and as a result taking them down, we are doing to absorb an additional $32 million worth of excess inventory charges. That was higher than we were hoping to have to absorb and that explains all of the difference between, where we were modeling, which was probably close to what you're, you're articulating and where we've landed. But no, the incremental margins the tools going up the door remained steady and highly lucrative but in this type of the ramp down, your excess capacity in the NAND has do take their toll.
Gary Hsueh: Okay.
Mark Dentinger: And Rick is right, we will get obviously get a windfall on our way backup.
Gary Hsueh: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Just a follow-up question, just on the reticle inspection kind of rebound and those orders, is that primarily TeraScan, TeraFab and if it's one or the other I mean, what is that indicate in terms of a near term trend here on the inspection side in reticles?
Richard Wallace: More oriented to our fab which frankly it was a bit of surprise to us. A good surprise but a surprise, and I think what it indicates is as customers are ramping their advanced design rules in the fab they are worried about the haze and crystal and growth, And so this was to deal with those challenges. We haven't really seen their shops turn back on and I think as you know Gary we've got new products coming out to deal with that. I think the other hand is there has been from a share standpoint, there've been alternatives in the market. And I think that customers really had a chance to shake out and evaluate the alternatives, and evaluate our tools and I think there this general flight-to-quality going on and that that's part of the story too.
Gary Hsueh: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about a OpEx progression, are we getting all the benefits in June quarter or how does it progress through the year?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, we won't get all of the benefits in the June quarter, Mahesh, because the reduction action that we just took in March under the warned act, it will probably take -- little bit more than half the quarter before, all of the reduction comes off of our payroll. So we get a partial benefit in the June quarter, which we signaled with a 3 to $5 million OpEx improvement in that quarter. I mean, you'll get sort of a full quarter benefit as we turn to the second half of the year. So, that's an essence how to think about it. And as we talked about trying to get to our OpEx levels of 140 to 145 by the December quarter. Certainly, based upon the progress this quarter the 140 looks more, probable at this moment.
Mahesh Sanganeria: And 140 is the more likely number?
Richard Wallace: I think it's more likely. That's right
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay. The second quick question on, if you can give us some indication on how will your segment distribution a quarter income of logic foundry memory look at June. Is it tilting towards one segment more than other in June, or is in the main essential as the same?
Richard Wallace: It looks pretty similar. And I would say that we could see a little more memory activity although not a lot. And I think when we look across logic and foundry, we're currently modeling -- foundry maybe down a little bit. And you see a little bit of logic come of. And again that's both because we see a little bit more memory. But again, not a lot of memory we're talking about; and non-semi space is about the same.
Mahesh Sanganeria: In the logics side, is there any activity other than microprocessors?
Richard Wallace: Well, I mean, yeah. I mean, there are other players in that space. But, the way we've been them microprocessor is clearly a reasonable part of that. But yeah, there is some other activity as well. There is some other logic investments going on both in U.S. and other regions as well. But again, not huge levels, but yes.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay. Thank you very much.
Richard Wallace: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Patrick Ho: Thank you. Can you guys hear me?
Richard Wallace: Yeah.
Patrick Ho: Quick question in terms of your orders outlook and the variability. I know, you guys are coming off of pretty low levels. And you guys actually did pretty well in terms of the March quarter. But that's plus or minus 20%, is that varies related to one customer or one or two customers. or is it a bunch of customers that can swing in either way. And I guess what customers segment is that primarily memory, foundry or logic that varies?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, Patrick, it's a good question. I think internally, we debate whether the guides bookings at all given the variability in this environment. As you know many of the other equipment companies has stopped guiding bookings. So, our view on that is, we think there is a number of things in the hacker (ph) we have the same probabilities to them, but we realize that some of those things can fall out. So, the issue is really variability, and the general lack of visibility in the environment.
Patrick Ho: Okay. So, is there is any one specific customer that's going to swing it either way?
Richard Wallace: No, because as I said, last quarter we didn't predict the orders that we got. We couldn't see them at the beginning of the quarter. And I don't take that changes in this environment.
Patrick Ho: Okay. And one follow-up question on the cost side of things. Now that u guys have taken your cost reductions efforts, and you at least have gone through them. Can you just kind of put them on a percentage wise, how much of it was, what I would guess permanent structural cost, and the rest temporary cost. Was there something like 30% with permanent cost reduction and 70% temporary cost reductions? Can you break it down now in terms of how much of each segment was?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, I wouldn't -- I would hesitate to characterize, clearly there is some above. And clearly, as business levels increased, things the temporary actions that we're taking like (inaudible) off the quarter and reduce bonuses and reduced variable compensation in general (Technical Difficulty) back to the normal. But there are also several actions that we took. We announced in closing, including closing some facilities and shipping capacity within the company that would be permanent in nature. So I hesitate to characterize how much of the actions are permanent versus temporary. It some of both, but you really -- it's a question at what level of output you're looking at. At this level obviously right now there is a greater percentage that are temporary as they recover. But the balance will be permanent.
Patrick Ho: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I will now turn the call back to Mr. Lockwood for any additional or closing remarks.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, operator. On behalf of Rick and Mark and the rest of the KLA-Tencor team, I'd like to say thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you in our follow-up discussions throughout the quarter.

Operator: At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation's Second Quarter Fiscal Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). And now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Ed Lockwood. Sir, you may begin your conference.
Ed Lockwood: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to KLA-Tencor's second quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings conference call. I'm Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Dentinger, our Chief Financial officer. We are here today to discuss second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2008. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release you can find it on our website, at www.kla-tencor.com, or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy.

And although we make no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, you could be assured that any updates we do provide will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter fiscal 2009 results reflected the compounding affect that the continued macroeconomic recession is having on an already weak industry environment for semiconductor equipment. In Q2, KLA-Tencor faced sharp reductions in capital spending ordered push-outs and factory shutdowns really across all our end markets and geographies. During the quarter, our customers accelerated plans to cut costs and conserve cash. They were dramatically scaling back their investment plans and reducing factory utilization throughout the period. This resulted in unprecedented low level of demand by the quarter end. As a result, we experienced sharper than anticipated declines in our orders, our revenue and our profitability in the period. Also, we see little sign of any meaningful recovery in the near term, and we're guarded against the possibility the business could actually decline from these already low levels. In light of this, we have an ongoing review of our short term outlook. We've already taken aggressive measures to reduce our operating expense and to drive structural efficiencies across our work, and now we're in the process of evaluating additional actions to adjust our cost structure in order to further reduce our breakeven revenue levels and to maximize our cash in this extremely challenging business condition. There is no doubt that we are experiencing extraordinary times. However, while we can't change the economic climate in which we are operating, we are well equipped because of our market leadership, the resources we have and our experience required to manage through this period and to continue to execute on our long-term strategy. So, not withstanding our increased emphasis on reducing costs, we do continue to invest in our business, our technology and our customers to strengthen our competitive position and lay the foundation for future growth. We're confident that we can manage through this downturn and emerge an even stronger company than we ever did. Let me talk a little bit about the December quarter end market environment. On January 12, we updated our guidance to reflect the steep decline in the industry activities that we were experiencing in the month of December. Our final results for the December quarter were in line with the revised outlook. New bookings were $243 million, down approximately 25% from September, and Q2 bookings reflected greater than expected drop in process control demand in the period, as our customers effectively halted technology development activity in the face of their extraordinary challenging market conditions. This is a unique condition and I think this reflects the depth and severity of this downturn. For years and throughout several cycles, customers have told us that even under the most severe end market conditions, they would continue to invest in technology development as a means of preserving near future competitive advantage. But in this period customer activity was an exception to that rule. In fact, excluding logic, which did continue to invest, foundry and memory were essentially idle during the quarter. As we manage the current downturn and position the company for the future, we will continue to maintain strict cost disciplines as we advance on our strategic objectives. We're going to focus on customers. We are going to driver a high level of investment in our market leadership and optimize the growth opportunities that have been availed to us in recent acquisitions. We believe this will play a critical role in our long-term success. I'll shift my focus to talk about the year ahead and discuss where we're placing our emphasis as we execute on our strategic objectives in this environment. First, our focus on our customer remains our top priority. We are maintaining a high level of investment in R&D as we're sure that's the critical success for K-T. Our goal is to maintain a leading position versus our nearest rival in every market that we serve, and today, we have a leading position in all but 2 of the 24 markets that we participate in. We're going to continue to maintain our leadership in the environment in spite of the fact that our customers are looking for ways to conserve their capital. In fact, we believe our competitive position will actually strengthen in this downturn as customers recognize that we're committed to maintaining a high level of investment in innovation throughout the cycle, while others are cutting back to preserve their viability. So, our continued emphasis on innovation and this high level of investment gives our customers assurance that they're going to get the most value from their investments today and in the future. Our second objective is growth. Here, our long-term strategy is to consistently grow faster than the industry. Obviously, industry growth was negative in 2008 and is forecasted to be negative again in 2009. So we've adjusted our focus to concentrate on cultivating and really strengthening our position in the new markets that we gain, both organically and through acquisitions. We're going to continue to innovate and drive differentiation and gain efficiencies in our new growth platforms. So we're in a position to grow in new segments as we come out of this downturn. In terms of our operational excellence, which is our third objective, our focus here is to drive structural improvements and achieve efficiencies across our businesses, with the particular emphasis in the short term of managing our cost structure to reduce our breakeven revenue level and to maximize cash. As we announced in November, we're executing plans to reduce out operating expenses over the next couple of quarters, in line with this objective. We're currently in the process of evaluating further steps to adapt to the declining macroeconomic conditions that we're seeing. So with the ongoing globalization efforts and our focus on streamlining our organization, we're positioning ourselves to be even stronger when business stabilizes and growth resumes. And our fourth objective is talent. Here, our focus is on developing and motivating the world class talent that's part of our company. Our focus in this current environment is to really optimize and engage and motivate those employees to help power us through these tough times. We've weathered many downturns before and we're prepared to navigate through this one. Clearly, the market is uncertain, but we're focused on the right markets with the leading edge technology. We will have unparalleled solutions and world-class talent who are executing on our strategy. From a position of strength, I think we can continue to build our company as we go through this period. And it does present actually unique opportunities to capitalize on our competitive advantage as we pull further away in terms of technology leadership, market leadership and leverage our financial strength to position us for the future. In terms of the March guidance, given the variability in our customers forecast today and the results of the implications for our financial results, we're adjusting our typical guidance practice to widen the range for our quarterly estimates. New orders in March are expected to be flat compared with December, plus or minus 20%. Revenues are expected to be between $280 million and $320 million, with a non-GAAP loss per share in the range of a loss of $0.20 to a loss of $0.35 per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Dentinger: Thanks, Rick. I'll remind everyone that we present our income statement in two formats, one under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and the other in a non-GAAP format, which excludes amortization and write-downs, goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquisitions, expenses associated with our stock options investigation and related litigation, and any other costs and expenses, which we do not expect to be recurring such as restructuring charges. Our balance sheet and cash flow statements are presented only in a GAAP format. Most of my prepared remarks will reference our non-GAAP income statements. For our reference to GAAP numbers, I'll make the distinction. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is attached to our press release and available at out our corporate website kla-tencor.com. Revenue for Q2 was $397 million, slightly below the guidance range we provided in October of $410 million to $430 million, and the GAAP loss per share was $2.57. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.12, below the low end of our guidance at breakeven, plus or minus $0.02. Larger than anticipated non-GAAP loss is driven by the following factors; lower than anticipated total revenues, net of standard gross margin impact, about $0.05 per share after taxes. Lower than expected gross margins $0.07 a share after taxes. Lower than expected operating expenses, $0.02, a benefit after taxes, and higher than expected charges for other income and expense, or OIE, $0.02 a share after taxes. A summary of the differences between Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are; acquisition related charges of $457 million or $2.28 per share after taxes, which includes a $437 million impairment write-down as a carrying cost of our acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock option restatement related charges of $9 million, $0.05 per share after taxes, and restructuring and severance charges of $24 million or $0.12 per share after taxes. In summary, Q2 was a difficult quarter. Deterioration of business conditions that we experienced in September continued throughout Q2 and worsened late in December. In our October call, we indicated that we would be taking steps beginning in Q2 to reduce our operating expenses to the $165 million to $170 million per quarter level by June of this year. In addition to the reduction steps we began in the December quarter, based on current conditions it is apparent that we will need to further reduce costs, and we plan to take additional cost reduction actions later this quarter. Despite these difficult circumstances, our market leading position in most of our products was consistent with the last several quarters and we remain focused on developing our next-generation tool. New orders for Q2 were $243 million, below our guided range of plus or minus 10% from last quarter's new bookings of $325 million. In addition, approximately $28 million of customer initiated delays pushed out of the December quarter and resulted in net new orders of $215 million. We expect the pushed out orders to reenter our backlog when the industry begins to recover. We ended the quarter with $628 million in total systems backlog after adjusting for customer initiated delays and foreign exchange impact. The backlog at December 31, 2008 includes $177 million of revenue backlog for products that have shipped and been invoiced, but have not signed off by customers and $451 million in orders that have not yet shipped. We expect the majority of the unshipped backlog to ship over the next six to nine months. The approximate regional distribution of new systems orders and the quarter-to-quarter change in regional distribution was as follows; US with 64% of new orders in Q2, up from 45% in December quarter, Europe with 7%, up from 4% in Q1 of '09, Japan was 22%, up from 21% last quarter, Korea had no orders this quarter versus 13% last quarter, Taiwan was 3% versus 6% last quarter, and the rest of Asia was 4%, down from 11% in Q1. The approximate Q2 distribution of new systems and services orders by market as well as the quarter-to-quarter change in market distribution was as follows; wafer inspection was 22%, down from 30% last quarter, reticle inspection was 8%, down from 10% last quarter, metrology was 15% up from 14% in prior quarters, and solar, storage, high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 7%, down from 9% last quarter. Service was 48% of new orders in Q2, up from 37% last quarter. 45-nanometer and below development and pilot activity was roughly 70% of the semiconductor systems orders received in the quarter. This level was down from 85% in our September quarter. As we move forward, visibility into a meaningful turn into business is very low and we do not anticipate significant improvements in new orders in Q3. For planning purposes, we are assuming new orders in Q3 at flat plus or minus versus Q2. Shipments in Q2 were $327 million, down from $420 million in the September quarter. Looking at our income statement, revenue for the quarter was $397 million. It was down 24% from last quarter and down 38% from Q2 of last year. Our services business, which has been much steadier and more resilient than our systems business, also declined $4 million or 3% from the prior quarter, as several customers suspended service contracts and idle tools in response to the downturn. Our current expectations for total revenue in Q3 is a range of $280 million to $320 million. Non-GAAP gross margin was 46%, down 9% from the September quarter and 4 points below what we internally modeled at the beginning of Q2. Lower than expected gross margin was largely attributable to $20 million in net additional excess inventory reserves required as a result of lowering our calendar 2009 manufacturing plans. Operating expenses were $199 million, down $10 million from the September quarter. R&D was $89 million in Q2, down $15 million from the September quarter, and selling, general and administrative expenses, or SG&A, was $110 million, a $5 million increase from last quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, operating expense changes were due to lower average headcount in all areas of the company, including both R&D and SG&A. In Q2, we reduced our accruals for non-executive bonuses by $12 million, which reduced both categories of operating spending. The headcount and bonus reductions in the SG&A line were more than offset by a $24 million increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts during the quarter, reflecting collection concerns about certain customers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In Q3, assuming there are no significant additions required to our bad debt reserves, we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease by approximately $30 million as the full quarter effect from the Q2 cost cutting measures is realized. Other income and expense, or OIE, was a net $12 million expense in Q2, largely as a result of lower yields on our cash and marketable securities portfolio, and a $4 million write-down of investments in our venture portfolio. OIE was a $4 million gain in fiscal first quarter, in part due to a $9 million one-time recovery of bad debt. The non-GAAP tax rate benefit is 29% in Q2 versus 37% charged last quarter. Although, our Q2 rate of 29% is very close to our long-term modeling rate of 30%, the rate benefit in Q2 was comprised of our expected benefits of fiscal 2009 of about 40%, offset by quarter-specific charges of about $3 million. Our non-GAAP operating loss was $20 million or $0.12 per share in Q2. These numbers include stock-based compensation expenses of $22 million and the weighted share is used to compute the loss per share were $169 million. At the revenue range I had previously mentioned, we would expect a Q3 non-GAAP loss of $0.20 to $0.35 per share, assuming a tax benefit of 30% and further assuming that there are no meaningful charges required for additional customer collection problems or unanticipated charges for excess inventory. As I previously mentioned, we also took a $437 million GAAP impairment charge in Q2 to write down carrying value of the unamortized portion of acquired intangibles and goodwill. The goodwill component of this charge was $272 million and was attributable to acquisitions in the metrology space. The other intangibles impairment of $163 million was largely attributable to lower near term expectations for businesses we recently acquired. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments, including long-term marketable securities, ended the quarter at just over $1.2 billion, a decrease of $84 million quarter-to-quarter. Cash used in operations, which include the semiannual interest payment of $26 million was $36 million in Q2 versus $81 million in operating cash generated during Q1. We also used $49 million of cash to repurchase shares early in Q2, $25 million to pay our dividend and we generated $21 million from stock sales to our employees. Net accounts receivable ended the quarter at $332 million, down $38 million from the prior quarter end. DSOs were 75 days at December 31 versus 63 days at September 30. As previously noted, we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by $24 million during Q2 to reflect collection concerns and the allowance at December 31, 2008 stands at $36 million. Inventory decreased by $31 million from last quarter and ended the quarter at $473 million. Large portion of the decrease in the balance resulted from a $20 million net charge for excess material, was also principally responsible for the lower than expected gross margins in Q2. Net capital expenditures were $7 million in Q2 versus $10 million in Q1. The weighted average shares in Q2 were 169 million versus 174 million shares in Q1. The declining weighted average share was largely the result of using the diluted method in Q1 when we had positive earnings versus the basic method in Q2 when we incurred a loss. For the March quarter, we are expecting another loss. So our weighted shares are expected to be about 171 million shares. No stock repurchases are anticipated in this quarter. Total headcount ended the quarter at 5,894, a decrease of 412 from September 30. The decrease in Q2 largely occurred following a reduction in force action we took in mid November, and we expect our headcount will continue to decline during Q3 as we adjust the company to reflect current business levels. Finally, our visibility into demand for semiconductor-based products continues to be limited. At this point, we do not expect any meaningful capacity related spending for at least the first half of calendar 2009. KLA-Tencor's long-term fundamentals are compelling and we are confident on our new product pipeline, but we are also aware of current business conditions. In our October call, we announced plans to reduce our quarterly operating expenses to $165 million to $170 million range by the end of June of '09, and doing so will allow us to breakeven between $350 million and $400 million in quarterly revenue. We took significant steps during Q2, but in light of the continuing weakness in the industry and uncertainties in the macro economy, we now expect to take additional actions in Q3 to Q4 to further reduce operating expenses to the $140 million to $145 million level by the second half of calendar 2009. These expense levels should allow us to breakeven at the operating cash flow line at total revenue levels of $300 million to $325 million per quarter, assuming there are no additional customer collectability issues and manufacturing plants stabilize. In summary, our guidance for Q3 is: new orders are expected to be flat, plus or minus 20% versus Q2. Total revenue between $280 million and $320 million, non-GAAP loss per share, which includes stock-based compensation, but excludes one-time charges in amortization, will be a loss of $0.20 to $0.35 per share assuming a tax benefit of 30% pre-tax loss. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you, Mark. At this point, we'd like to open the call for questions. And we once again request you limit yourself to one question given the limited time we have today. Feel free to re-queue for your follow-up question, and we'll do our best to get everyone in today's call. So operator we're ready for our first question.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jay Deahna with JPMorgan.
Jenny Yun - JPMorgan: Hi. This is [Jenny Yun] for Jay. LAM yesterday said they are in a midst of a Category 5 hurricane and it's going to last six to eight quarters and WFE will be down 50%. Do you feel the same with respect to your business, and if you can explain why, that would be great.
Rick Wallace: Hi, Jenny, this is Rick. I'm sorry, down 50%, was that the number?
Jenny Yun - JPMorgan: Yeah, WFE will be down 50% in '09.
Rick Wallace: I think that as we look out on the year, we don't make a business of forecasting the business over the long-term. I think it's very difficult the do that. So instead we try to model what do we think reasonable scenarios are and how do we react. And we want to have some lead time in our models because the actions that we take, take a little while to implement. So I think right now there's no question as we've seen a pretty dramatic downdraft in the business, and really a lot of customers are just shutting off. So when we look at '08, '08 was a very difficult year. We did hold up better than the rest of our major peers. We think the same thing will happen in '09. But I do think it's reasonable to assume you can model anywhere between a down 35 to down 50 for CapEx in '09, but it's still early to tell what's going to actually happen in terms of later in the year. We have trouble predicting what March is going to look like. So we're trying to size the company appropriately and that's why we talked about the 300 to 325 run rate and go from there. But I think it's awful early to forecast that far out.
Jenny Yun - JPMorgan: You performed better than your peers because you are in process control or because of market share gains or why would that be?
Rick Wallace: We look across a number of metrics, booking, shipping revenue, operating profit; I think it's a combination of factors, but stemming from the necessary investment our customers find in the segments that we serve, inspection and metrology. We also believe that our market position enables us to earn the significant investment it requires our customers to make to buy our tools, but they see value in that. So I think it's a function of the segments that we're in, and I think our business model also enables us to continue to perform even in very difficult periods like this relative basis better than the rest of our peers.
Jenny Yun - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you very much. You guys have talked about some logic activity in terms of Q4 orders, but really foundries and memory being idle. Relative to the flat guidance in Q1, is that kind of what you expect from an order perspective in Q1, and then potentially looking a little bit further out, is that what you see for the foreseeable future? Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Sure, Jim. We expect a little bit of memory spending. I wouldn't say a lot. Nothing is a lot in these ranges, but certainly you heard Korea was zero for last quarter. So we see some in memory and a little bit in foundry, but still the dominant part of our business, the largest share would be in the logic. The way we're currently modeling, I have to put a caveat in that which is there's been a lot of variability, so it's very hard for us at this time to have much certainty around these forecasts.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you so much.
Rick Wallace: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Junaid] calling in for Tim. Hi, Rick. Have you looked at maintenance CapEx for the industry? It would be interesting to see what your view on that is.
Rick Wallace: Sure. Yeah, I understand the model. I think it's an interesting thesis, and I agree that there is some level of investment our customers continue to make just to keep their relevancy of the investment fleet that they have. In our case, we do see products being upgraded. And so, I think the idea that we're close to maintenance is an interesting way to view it. However, it's not exactly the case for our kind of equipment. We do see investment going on and upgrading the existing fleet, but since we're not so closely tied to production, we're more tied to the development of new technologies and ramping. It doesn't apply as much for KLA-Tencor. But I think the notion that the CapEx is bottoming and we're in the down 35% to 50% range for the calendar year, if you attribute that to the maintenance concept, I think that's a reasonable thing to do.
Unidentified Analyst: Have you looked at a number which is down 50%?
Rick Wallace: As I said earlier, we're modeling a down 35% to down 50% because we have such little visibility into the later parts of this year. I think we have a reasonable understanding of what March could look like, but even then we've put pretty wide numbers around it. And then, we believe a slight improvement in the overall environment in the June quarter. So much of this depends on the macroeconomic factors as we know and also on the credit and the availability of some our customers to get access to funds, so I think that those are factors that make it very hard to call. That's why we have a fairly large range for internal modeling purposes.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Rick, I'm wondering in this kind of environment when you're looking at your sales, technology buys mostly in the logic, what parts of your product portfolio are doing better? I mean, nothing is doing great, but what's doing better than others? Are you seeing a change in the competitive environment in this kind of weak environment or is there just not enough business to judge that? I think I missed it if you gave it, but usually you give the breakdown by product segment orders?
Rick Wallace: Sure. Yes, Brett. First of all, we give it. I think Mark could pull that up exactly.
Mark Dentinger: Yes. Brett, let me give it to you real quickly, and also let me make one correction before I turn it back to Rick. In my prepared remarks, I think I said the revenue for Q2 was down 24%, and that was incorrect. It was actually down 26%. So, if you were listening, I apologize for that. Let me just say what we disclosed in my prepared remarks is that wafer inspection was 22% this quarter, which is down from 30% last quarter. Reticle inspection was 8% this quarter. That was down from 10% last quarter. Metrology was up a little bit, 15% this quarter versus 14% last quarter. The storage solar high brightness LED and the non-semi stuff was down approximately 7% this quarter. That was relative to 9% last quarter. And service was up considerably this quarter as a percentage of the whole, it's 48% in Q2 versus 37% in Q1.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Okay. Brett, on you other question, technology buys, unlike in the past where in this part of the cycle we would have seen people buying in anticipation of ramping our slow ramps, this is almost pure technology buy. So the products that tend to sale more in that kind of environment are the ones that are used for process characterization and development and almost nothing for pilot production monitoring. So that means the high-end brightfield wafer inspection tools would be an example of the kind of product we'd be selling in this environment. So, we don't see much in the way of overall business capacity, but certainly tends to be on the high end. In terms of the competitive front, there isn't a lot of data to see market share, but the indications are we've actually strengthened our position, and I believe that is because our competitors are dealing with viability issues and we're continuing to invest pretty heavily in the R&D. One of the upsides, maybe, is we've made remarkable progress in our product roadmaps. Unfortunately that's because we're not being bothered by field issues because where few customers are running at very high utilization. So it does give our engineering guys a chance to focus, but we've made really good progress on the product roadmap in the last quarter
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. And then just one last quickie, we've heard from some companies that they are having to extend terms and things like that, are you seeing a big change in what you're needing to do to secure some of the orders?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, Brett. This is Mark. The answer is, yeah, that does come and entered into the discussion. We deal with it on a case-by-case basis. But yeah, the customer's financial issues are being passed along to us and it's a reality of doing business in this environment.
Rick Wallace: On top of that, we're being careful about how we do that. So, that's something that we do look at, as Mark said, case-by-case.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Brett.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
CJ Muse - Barclays Capital: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess with Vistec coming in, I guess, starting in Q4, and ICOS really starting to ramp in Q3, how do you think about your non-semi equivalent business growth or lack of growth rate in 2009 calendar year relative to calendar '08? How should we think about that contribution?
Rick Wallace: It's a great question, CJ. I think right now there are different segments that we're seeing in that. The MIE for Vistec actually is pretty tied to the rest of our business. I would say that's not really a business that's outside our core there, the reticle business, and that business seems to be doing all right relatively speaking. The other one, ICOS, and we have seen pretty severe slowdown in the backend. We've also seen a recent slowdown in the solar business. So I would say that the expectation for the growth rate we have for those businesses, we're not seeing it right now and I don't see anything in the near term that leads us to believe that there will be significant growth on that side of the business. The one exception is the high brightness LED stuff seems to going along, and so there's some business there for us. Although it's not much of a factor, it looks pretty consistent with the rest of KT.
CJ Muse - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then, in terms of the order guide that $100 million range, I know we're bouncing along the bottom here, but could you give a little specificity. Is there one or two orders, is that primarily Korea, how should we think about that?
Rick Wallace: It's such a big number as you gathered, and we debated on whether we should guide at all because it is such a big number. It's really a number of factors. Based on what we saw on the December quarter, I think our historical ability to predict who comes and who goes is just such that it's really hard to say because people that we counted on the past have always invested and were always there no matter what the environment was for the last 10 years. They backed out at the end of last quarter. Unfortunately, it's across the board because, remember, service is a good part of our business, so you're really talking very broad range on the systems business.
CJ Muse - Barclays Capital: Okay. If I can just sneak one last one, the tax rate of 30% for fiscal '09 and fiscal '10?
Mark Dentinger: Yes, good question. Actually, our fiscal '09 I think that the rate is likely to be a little bit higher than that, just because there is some unique things happening this year. In fact, if you broke down my comments on the Q2 tax rate, it was actually, spare one-time items, we probably would have had a tax benefit closer to 40%. So my suspicion is we're going to be a little bit better than 30% for the rest of fiscal '09. But I think when we turn the corner and go into fiscal '10, the best guess we have is our long-term modeling assumption, which we use for all of our internal planning of 30% is still where the rate will vacillate around.
CJ Muse - Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cohen & Company.
Raj Seth - Cohen & Company: Thanks. Rick, you may have touched on it before, but I missed it. Can you talk about how you expect service in this environment to trend across relative to the equipment forecast you gave?
Rick Wallace: Sure, Raj. I think what we're seeing is pressure in the service business for sure, and we did see service come down last quarter due to that pressure. What's interesting now though is when we talk to our customers, what we're finding is they're actually pretty heavily utilizing the tools that they have. So I think for the process equipment guys, there's a cost of consumables and it's directly tied to wafer processing. So they're going to, I think, suffer more greatly than we will on our service business. What we've seen is customers actually increase sampling rates and keep the tools utilized. I was talking to a team yesterday, they were talking to customer and they said, with your excess capacity, and the customer says, we don't have any excess capacity, we're using it all. So, as a result of that, I think our service business will hold up better than our peers, but there is pressure on it. And of course, our challenge is to make sure we continue to deliver value to our customers in that. So we're working very hard on it. But we don't have the consumables part of that, and I think that's part of what helps us in this.
Raj Seth - Cohen & Company: Sure. So wafer starts, let's say, are down, I don't know, 35% and other service businesses are down proportional to that, is half of that rate realistic for you?
Rick Wallace: I think it is and maybe even better. I think the reason better is because a lot of the equipment that we have under contract is being used for some of the development work. So I think that could help us, but there is definitely pressure on it for sure and customers are looking to cut their operating expense as well.
Raj Seth - Cohen & Company: Great. Thanks.
Rick Wallace: Thanks, Raj.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick, you mentioned clearly you're going to come out stronger competitively through this downturn. If I look at the PDC market, let's say, you have 60% market share, 10% of Applied and 10% of Hitachi and the remaining 20% is quite fragmented. Assuming all those guys go out of business in this downturn, then what percentage of the 20% can you capture given your products and positioning?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, that's a great question, Atif. I think it's two things. One, by stronger I mean better products. We keep investing. We've got some very exciting products in the pipeline. So I think it could be two things. One, we could create more value, which means not necessarily share gain per se, but more pricing power. I think that's an important attribute. And the other thing is I do think some of the smaller guys are not going to make it through this cycle. So, from that standpoint, there could be some share gain involved in that. We're not modeling any. I think that our general belief is we focus on maintaining our share. We kind of like our share where it is, but we think that we can continue to create more value and that will help protect and build on gross margins in the recovery.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Right. But have you actually had discussions with customers or have they come to you with the concerns that the smaller guys won't be able to and that they don't want to rely on the smaller guys this cycle?
Rick Wallace: Yes. Actually we have seen some of that. I think that there is some concern from our customers about the ability of some of the smaller players to continue to invest. On the other hand, our customers still have dual supplier policies and I don't see them changing that behavior. So I think it's a combination there. For us, the best thing we can do is keep creating products that our customers need, and I think we'll be able to do that by virtue of our balance sheet and our business position.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And one quick one, shipment guidance for the March quarter, what was the number?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. We actually have suspended giving shipment guidance on a quarterly basis. We did that last quarter. So we are disclosing shipments, but not shipment guidance.
Atif Malik - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thanks for taking my question. I jumped on the call a little bit later, Rick. I was just wondering if you had any comments on the variability of the bookings guidance for March. Is there any large projects at all that might be swinging things around or is there a bunch of little orders that could move the numbers from the low end to the high end. What would cause that?
Rick Wallace: The variability in the guidance is we're at such low numbers that if you talk about one of our larger tools, it can swing a very large percentage. And so, it's not so much that there are large orders. For us, many single sales constitute a larger percentage than ever before at these levels. What I said earlier is we debated whether or not to even give the guidance at all, but figured that with a larger range we could kind of talk about the midpoint of where we are pointing. But we saw so much strange behavior last quarter in terms of our customers that we felt that it was necessary to widen the range.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Understood. If I look at deferred revenue balance, I missed that number, what was it at the end of December and what do you expect the drawdown will be in March?
Mark Dentinger: Let me look it up for you real quick. There are two components. The deferred revenue number at the end of December was about $71 million and the deferred systems profit number was $83 million and how you look at it. The deferred revenue number from the September quarter was up a little bit, about $10 million, and the deferred profit number was essentially flat.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Sorry, did you say $177 million or $77 million?
Rick Wallace: $77 million.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. And what do you expect the drawdown on that will be in March?
Mark Dentinger: We're not forecasting what the specific drawdown would be on the deferred revenue in March.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Would there be a drawdown at all?
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: I suppose it could go either way.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Understood. On cost reductions you mentioned that you are going to take more expense reductions. How should we think about the magnitude of that as we look into the second half?
Mark Dentinger: Actually the cost reduction actions that we're looking at that we would start action on this quarter are designed to drive us into an operating cost structure of $140 million to $145 million a quarter, probably realizable in the second half of this year at some point.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Pelayo with HSBC.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Great. First, a clarification your guidance for bookings is flattish. Is that against the 243 gross or the 250 net in the December quarter? And the second question is, your revenue guidance is relatively in line with consensus, but EPS range is quite a bit weaker there. The two areas that we haven't talked about is really the gross margin line or the other income line. Are there anything special going on there that we should be thinking about in the March quarter?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah. On the other income line that should stabilize, again, assuming that we don't have any additional write-downs required in the venture portfolio and interest rates are reasonably stable as we move through the quarter. They are so low right now, the passive yield on our investment portfolio is so low right now, it's hard to imagine they're going much further. On the venture portfolio, there's always some risk it could go down, but those are the two things that drove it a little bit lower. On the operating side, it's strictly a question of how soon we can action some of the decisions we need to make about the further cost reduction actions on operating expenses. But as I indicated, we're going to start them this quarter and try to drive forward. The gross margin line is the tricky one. With the guidance as wide as it is and we've contemplated and taken in all the considerations that Rick previously mentioned in establishing the guidance, the real question boils down to product mix versus service mix and whether or not we're required to drawdown build plans any further than what we have already drawn them down for the rest of calendar '09. We are being cautious about the gross margin percentage that we're implicitly guiding to, but it's a wide range of variability and that does account for some of the reason why you would see not as robust a profit as you might expect at those revenue levels.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Once again, the bookings guidance, is that against gross number comparison?
Mark Dentinger: Yes.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: I'm sorry, yes.
Mark Dentinger: Yes, it is against gross.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: And then, final question for me is, I think at the end of each calendar year you tend to get some service contract renewals. So is your expectation that service bookings are down in March and effectively system bookings are up?
Mark Dentinger: Not necessarily. We are keeping a tight eye. We did get a drop off in, if you will, contract renewals or contract suspensions as we ended the December quarter. But it is possible as we move forward into the third quarter and the fourth quarter that we can make some of that backup with what we call the billable work, where people call up and we get an increased chargeability. So we're not necessarily signaling one way or another, what that might have to do or how that may respond in the revenue line.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next line is from Steven Chen with UBS.
Omar Zallan - UBS: Hello. This is [Omar Zallan] calling in for Steven Chen. My question is, your services sales have been relatively stable, do you expect them to continue with that relative strength going forward? And then I have a follow-up.
Mark Dentinger: It's not clear. We would expect it to be stabler, as Rick indicated, than some industry, than some other companies in our peer compares, just by virtue of the nature of the business. But it's not clear whether or not it will strengthen or weaken in this environment. We're sort of prepared for a flattish type of outcome as we are looking at it right now, and clearly, hoping for better than that. But as it is right now, it's a little difficult to tell. It was fairly strong into early Q2, but it did drop off late in Q2. So as it is right now, it's not clear exactly where it's going and it was down slightly for the whole quarter. Again, we are thinking about that as flattish right now and looking for further signals. It's not likely to rapidly drop off the face of the earth and it's also not likely to skyrocket in the current environment.
Omar Zallan - UBS: Okay. Thanks for that. And just as a quick follow-up, since sales to Korea were zero, do you get the sense that your Korean customers are waiting for a decision on the Taiwanese government bailout before signing orders, creating some pent-up demand?
Rick Wallace: I hadn't thought that aspect through. I think what we saw there was just reluctance to spend capital in an environment with pretty severe changes to their end market. So I think a lot of our customers are just trying to get their footing right now and figure out what does the world look like before they spend. We had one major customer in Korea obviously go through reorganization and that probably contributed to a slowing decision making process. So we will see.
Omar Zallan - UBS: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer & Company.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer& Company: Thank you for taking my question. I might have missed this, but could you give the order breakout by memory, foundry and logic?
Rick Wallace: Sure. Mark, you got that?
Mark Dentinger: Yes. What we did was we broke it down and actually didn't disclose that. We may have the data compiled somewhere. Let me see if I can look it up for you.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer& Company: Okay. Let me move on. I am just trying to parse the difference in your guidance with the difference perhaps on Lam or Varian. You guys are guiding to a much more modest decline in revenue. Certainly, the order outlook looks like it's a lot more benign than what the industry feels like. Do you feel that has more to do with your inspection metrology market or do you think it has more to do with your specific customer exposure, primarily to one single logic iDM customer here near term in December and March?
Mark Dentinger: All right, Gary. I'll take the first part of your question also. Memory was about 3% last quarter in December, logic was 90% and foundry was about 5%, and didn't quite average to 100, 92, 3 and 5, but about 25% of our business was non-semi and the service business is holding up better than our peers. So I think back to your question of why we think things are, why we're projecting that will hold up better, I think it's a combination of a couple of factors. One, we still do see technology buys happening although at a low level for technology development, and I think the people that are doing pilot production or coming on production aren't going to see any of that business and that tends to be pretty heavily inspection metrology related. I'd also say that the service business holds up better for us in this kind of environment because of the nature of the business. We are not selling consumables. We are not as tied directly to manufacturing volumes. And I think the third thing is we do have some business outside of semi, which are doing okay right now. I wouldn't say that they are doing great, but we said the non-semi was going to be a reasonable part of our business and that continues to go. Those are the factors that allow us to view the world that way, but our pure-semi systems business we do see that would be more pronounced down, but we have other businesses to support us.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer& Company: Okay. And I guess my last question is just to kind of test how conservative your guidance is. Are you kind of automatically assuming here a certain percentage push out in terms of shipments and revenue out of your currently existing forecast for the March quarter? Is there a sufficient amount of conservatism now build into your March quarter guidance that pretty much preclude a negative pre-announcement here at the end of Q1?
Mark Dentinger: Obviously, that's why we would pre-announce. We gave a range. We widened it because of the volatility and the lack of visibility in the industry. And so, this we thought was a reasonable look given all the variations. But I would say in this market almost anything goes, and if you saw what happened at the end of December, I think it surprised a lot of people. And so, obviously, there are other things that could happen but we scrub it weekly, we look at it closely and right now we think it's a reasonable estimate for March. With regards to push outs, we have modeled that I think reasonably well, and I think it's a pretty reasonable estimate at this point.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer& Company: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Mark Dentinger: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much. Just the breakout you gave for the systems orders, just want to make sure that logic 90%, foundry 5% and memory 3%.
Rick Wallace: Yeah, logic 92 is the actual.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So if I look at your system order close to 100 million to 120 million, logic looks like probably from one customer, how does that logic order trend in next couple of quarters?
Rick Wallace: Yeah. I wouldn't assume one customer. The other thing on this is, I would say that doesn't count non-semi, which was about 25%, nor does it count service. We expect the March quarter logic to not be as strong as either a percent of our total, and since we're guiding flat, it also means it would be down in absolute terms.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: So logic is going to be down and you expect foundry or memory --
Rick Wallace: We're talking small numbers. So let me just be clear because if somebody says you're talking about memory going up by a factor of five, I'll say we're talking about a small number of orders of things that we have pretty clear visibility into memory, so some small percentage of memory and a slight uptick in the foundry business.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: So overall can you give us an idea of how the non-semi business is going to do in 2010 versus 2009?
Rick Wallace: Seriously?
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Sorry, 2009 versus 2008.
Rick Wallace: Okay. That's still hard, by the way. I think that 2009, it's in everything that we can see, the end of the calendar year of '08. For example, our solar business was chug along and growing, and we saw the brakes just get hit late in the calendar year. So I think solar has cooled off quite a bit, and I think it's a multitude of reasons for that. So we'll see some business there. The high brightness LED, even those guys I think have stopped growing. I don't know if they're slinking yet, but they've stopped growing. So I think there's some business there and some opportunity. Backend tests right now is virtually turned off. So I think there are a number of segments there that are going be down just like the rest of the market, and it's hard to see any short term catalyst for really anything. That's why we're so guarded on our visibility. So we model '08 overall, '08 to '09, and it looks like overall trends continue to be downward pressing.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Kim with Deutsche Bank.
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering, given the sharp cuts to OpEx and R&D, I'm sure it's included in there, do you expect to exit or shed any market segments?
Mark Dentinger: We have ongoing review of our portfolio, Peter, and I think that the decisions that we've made in the last few years still were the right ones in terms of the markets that we chose to exit. Right now, everything is under review, but we actually like the position that we have in all the market segments. And I think the challenge for us is to maintain those options for growth platforms as we go forward. Part of our belief in this downturn is that others will have to do that, because they're not as financially viable as we are, and then we'll be in a position to grow share as we come out. So there's none that we are currently looking at exiting at this point.
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Okay. And you characterize the backend and some of the sub segments of the front-end, I was wondering if you could characterize the bare wafer market, how that's doing relative to the other segments.
Rick Wallace: Sure. Bare wafer is off. I mean, there's almost no advancement going on bare wafer and I think that the bare wafer manufacturers have seen the advance for their products reducing. Whether or not that picks up in later in the calendar year is a pretty hard one to judge right now. But there may be some technology things that happen there, but for capacity I think they've got enough.
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. My name is Marian in for Patrick Ho. What is your take or position in terms of the potential consolidation in the DRAM market and do you think this could hurt or help KLA-Tencor when all is said and done.
Rick Wallace: I think, overall, it's probably healthy for the market to get to a more rational number of players. And so, I think that if there is consolidation that comes through this cycle, in the longer run that will probably make a healthier industry and that's good for us. I think it favors larger players. So, from that standpoint, I think it's good for us. I do think for the short-term, no. It means there is churn, there is less decision making and that's part of the turmoil we're seeing in the market right now. So I don't think for the short term it's good for anybody, but longer term probably good.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. My last question is, what is your view on cash and what do you expect to burn in the near term?
Rick Wallace: Obviously, cash is critical in this environment and I think that's pretty clear for all the major players. So our philosophy has been to do everything we can to reduce our burn rate, but at the same time recognizing that we do have a very strong balance sheet and we have the means to be able to tradeoff some cash usage for continued R&D investment. Mark, add any color to that?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah. When we talked about the model going forward by the end of calendar 2009, basically, breakeven if the operating cash line is at $300 million to $325 million, that gives you a sense of the fact that if we can stabilize that line, we think our cash balances and our other resources will allow us to continue for quite a while at those level.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's questions. Do you have any closing remarks?
Rick Wallace: No. Thank you very much operator. Thank you everyone for joining us on our call today. We look forward to seeing you all on our next earnings call scheduled in April.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may all now disconnect.

Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer:  Thank you Ed, good afternoon everyone and thank your for joining us for our Q1 earnings call. Today I will discuss highlight of our performance in the September quarter, give an update on the current market environment and provide guidance for the December quarter. In Q1 KLA-Tencor maintained our market share leadership, while at the same time leading our financials target for the quarter on the phase of the pervasive industry write-down and announcing global economic uncertainty. We expect the oversupply and device inventories, reduced consumer demand and limited access of financing will continue to constrain our customer capital investments for the foreseeable future. So we even with low order levels across the board today and with visibility very limited our customer continue to invest in technology development of leading edge devices which benefit KLA-Tencor. Our strategic focus in these challenging is the strength in KLA-Tencor competitive position and laid the foundation for superior growth once industry growth resume. Our market share leadership, the exceptional value of our technology and our strong balance sheet provide the resources to continue to invest in growth, to invest in advancing our technology roadmap and to maintain a high level of customer focus while others are scaling back. We also provide the flexibility to manage the business to breakeven profitability road better and in spite of the weak demand environment and the great degree of uncertainty as to the duration of this downturn that persist in the market today. Now turning to more detail on the September quarter results. Starting with the numbers, revenue in Q1’09 was $533 million and net income of $55 million or $0.32 per diluted share excluding onetime charges. We generated approximately $81 million in cash flow from operations in the period, and $1.3 billion in cash and investments as of September 30th. New bookings in the quarter were $325 million, down approximately 33% from June and below the range of guidance. Q1 bookings reflects seasonality we typically experience in our first fiscal quarter in terms supply by increasing inability our customers to deploy capital in the phase of the unfavorable economic environment which resulted in weak demand across all sectors and geographies in the quarter with exception of logic. In the month of September we saw further push out for memory and foundry orders with customers these projects into 2009. Although we think demand has reached minimum levels necessary to sustain our customers advanced development investment, this ability remains weak, and we expect the general reluctant among our customers to invest will persist for the foreseeable future. Looking at the Q1 demand texture in the individual end market, where I think orders were strong once again coming in at 77% of the total as Logic continue to push investment and leading edge development. Memory was approximately 16% than the orders in Q1. The memory industry continues to grab a little prolonged inventory oversupply condition with result in pressure on pricing and margins significantly impacting economics in this market. This coupled with concern that weakening global economy will further dampen consumer demand has led to a significant pullback in capacity investment and memory, with memory customers scaling down CapEx budgets and delaying previously plan program well onto 2009. Additionally, we would expect that recent consolidation trend and the memory market to continue as the industry works to rationalize capacity. In the interim, we expect market leaders to remain focused on the device strength and increasing yield to improve margin, which we believe will benefit KLA Tencor. Foundry bookings were down sequentially in the September quarter at 6% of orders. Foundry capacity utilization is expected to trend down in the near term in conjunction with declining demand for both mainstream and leading edge products impacting equipment demand in this market. Overall, despite of the poor visibility we are experiencing today across our industry, process control remain key success factor to our customers, as they advanced their technology roadmaps with the leading edge. Although investment levels are low today, we are maintaining pricing discipline in our market leadership and our indispensability to our customers remained a powerful competitive differentiator for KLA-Tencor. Looking ahead to the rest of calendar year 2008 and into the first half of 2009, we see real evidence today of the meaningful near term improvement in the demand environment. Taking this into account we are taking actions to manage through this uncertain economic time and then capitalize on opportunities for KLA Tencor to sustain and grow our market leadership in this downturn, and position the company even more strongly in the future. I would like take you through some of the key areas as focused as we manage through this period. Number one, we are focused on our core businesses in this period of compressed capital budget. Leveraging our strong balance sheet, our market leadership, the breadth of our global field support infrastructure and our product portfolio to support our customers’ investment and advance technology development while also addressing the high numbers on cost. This will further strengthen our position for the next phase of capacity investment on our industry when it again materializes. Number two; we will continue our high phase of investment in R&D, while the declining demand environment is putting pressure on the R&D budgets elsewhere in our industry. We intend to maintain our relatively high levels of the investment technology of the same time in proving efficiency in our R&D effort, advancing our technology leadership, and pushing a product roadmap that addresses our customer requirement in end cost to and beyond. These investments are targeted not only advancing KLA Tencor’s leadership and our core market but also focus on supporting technology development and integration activities among our recently acquired businesses which are key components for our long term growth strategy. We acknowledge that the decision to invest for growth in this environment while the trade off in terms of near term earning power, but we think over the long term these actions will help to further strengthen our competitive position and provide a catalyst for accelerated growth in this next investment cycle. Third, we intend to continue to focus on advancing on our diversification's strategy. Our end market profile has change significantly since the last major down turn in 2009, then we have addressed five or six primary segment focused on wafer inspection, reticle wafer and metrology market, and these businesses accounted for about 80% of total revenue. Today we have 10 primary engines for growth at KLA Tencor, and we diversified into adjusted market such a wafer metrology, mass metrology, back end packaging, solar and high brightness LED. Our strategy to broaden our footprint opens up access to market to an attractive growth and profitability characteristics to drive our future performance. While these new growth engines have also been subject to the current economy downturn, they should help reduce our exposure to the volatility of the wafer front end market when more normal demand conditions resume. The final success factor for KLA Tencor in this environment was our strong balance sheet and operating model. As I mentioned we are investing today across our portfolio to support our long term strategic growth objectives. In addition, we are also committed to managing the business to deliver breakeven profitability or better. To that end we are currently in the process of implementing additional cost reduction action in support of that objective. In conclusion, no doubt times are tough today, and visibility into a sustainable recovering demand is still very limited. But we believe KLA Tencor is operating from a position of strength, and have a right strategy in place to weather this storm. More importantly, in challenging environment presents unique opportunities for KLA Tencor to capitalize on our competitive advantage in terms of technology, market leadership and financial strength, position us for success in the future when a healthy demand environment resumes. Now discuss our outlook for the December quarter. We were in guarded on our outlook as we expect the demand environment to remain unpredictable for the foreseeable future with CapEx limited to technology investment programs, and longer term visibility virtually non existence. In terms of guidance, new orders in the current quarter are expected to be flat compared with September, plus or minus 10%. Revenues are expected to be between $410 million and $430 million. A non-GAAP EPS at break even plus or minus $0.02 excluding onetime charges. Now I would like to introduce Mark Dentinger. As many of you know Mark joined KLA Tencor in September as CFO and in the past two months he is already making an impact and helping to navigate through these challenging time. I would like to once again to welcome Mark to the team. Mark.
Mark Dentinger – Chief Financial Officer:  Thanks Rick. Revenue for the quarter was $533 million slightly above the guidance range we provided in July of 510 to 525 million and fully diluted GAAP EPS was $0.11. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.32 at the low end of our guidance, but was impacted by circumstances that drove our tax rate up on to almost 37%, a 7 point higher than the 30% range we got it in July. A higher than anticipated tax-rate reduced EPS by $0.03 in Q1. Absent this issue non-GAAP EPS would be in $0.35. We will discuss tax issue in more detail later in the call. The differences between Q1 GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are acquisition related charges are $40.3 million or $0.17 per share after tax. Stock-option restatement related charges are $3.8 million or $0.02 per share after tax. In this stocks revenue severance charges of $4 million or $0.02 share after tax. In our press release you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation which address at the adjustments I've just mentioned in more detail. The remainder of my comments will be on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments I just mentioned, but improved stock-based compensation. We continued the acquisition of Vistec's MIE business unit, here after refer to as MIE at the end of September. So the MIE results have a negligible impact on our income statement in Q1, other balance sheet includes the MIE assets and liabilities as of quarter end. In terms of financial performance we made our target for Q1 in a difficult environment. Our market position in all products and businesses was consistent with the last several quarters. Despite of the tough environment we view downturns as an opportunity to strengthen our position; it will have a strong set of products for next generation production notes. While the economic instability which began impacting our business several quarters ago continued in Q1 and grow with an unprecedented level of caution by our customers in making capital investment decisions. The number of fab expansion projects that had appeared solid for Q1 back in July pushed out of the quarter driving lower than expected new order level this quarter. In this environment customers are only investing in advanced technology node development, while we expect most of these order wins will lead to future capacity business of KLA Tencor as these nodes ramp to production, they are small today and resulted in new order of $325 million in Q1, down 33% from the June quarter and below our guided range of a decrease between 5 and 25%. Additionally we scrub our backlog quarterly to reflect only orders with the leadership in the next full of month. We do this -- decided the company properly, both in manufacturing and operating expenses and to send clear demand signals to our supply chain. In Q1 we initiated $60 million of backlog reduction largely to reflect shipment delays from certain customers. We expect the majority of these orders to reenter our backlog over the next six months as new delivery dates firm. We ended the quarter with $811 million in total backlog after adjusting for customer initiated delays, acquisition related adjustments, and foreign exchange impact. The $811 million in backlog at September 30 include $250 million of revenue backlog for product that have been shift in voice but have not yet been signed off by customers, and $561 million in a orders that had not yet shift to customers. We expect the majority of the unshipped backlog to ship over the next six to nine months. The approximate regional distribution if new orders the quarter, quarter change in regional distribution was as follows. US is 45% in Q1 up from 33% in the June quarter. Europe was 4%, down from 6% in Q4 of ’08, Japan was 21% up from 15%, Korea was 13% flat versus last quarter, Taiwan was 6% also flat as last quarter and the rest of Asia was 10% down from 16% in the June quarter. The approximate distribution in new orders in Q1 by market vise, based on inspection with 30% down from 45% last quarter, reticle inspection with 10% flat versus last quarter, metrology was 14% down from 20% in the prior quarter, and storage, solar high brightness LED and other non-semi was approximately 9% up from 2% last quarter. Service was 31% in Q1 up from 23% last quarter. 45 nanometer and below development and pilot activity was roughly 85% of the semiconductor system orders received in the quarter. This order was roughly 75% in our June quarter. As we move forward, visibility into a meaningful turn in the business is well and we do not anticipate significant improvement in new order in Q2. We will continue to manage the company inline with these business levels until and up during the gathering. Looking at our income statement, revenue for the quarter was $533 million; this is down 10% from last quarter and down 32% from Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54.9%, down 170 basis points from the June quarter. The gross margin decline is due to a higher percentage of service revenue, condition from recent acquisition, and lower manufacturing capacity utilization. In the December quarter we expect gross margins to decline further due to the three factors. One, the revenue mix was shipped earlier as we expect product revenue will decline a $100 to a $120 million while service revenue will be roughly flat. Two, we will include the MIE results for the fourth quarter and we will transition MIE to our customer acceptance driven revenue recognition policy both of which will be margin dilutive. And three, lower manufacturing capacity utilization will also create a margin pressure. As anticipated in the July conference call, operating expenses were $209 million up $16 million from the June quarter as we absorb the full quarter in Q1. R&D was a $104.5 million in Q1 offsetting $0.3 million from June due to ICOS, as well as continued investment in key researching development and application for next generation technology. SG&A for the quarter was a $104.4 million, up $9.1 million from last quarter. In Q2 we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease by $5 million as we begin to see the benefit of synergies with recent M&A activities. In addition, we will initiate a number of cost cutting measures design to reduce operating expenses in the next few quarter. In total the acquisitions of ICOS last quarter and MIE in September will lookout for about $24 million of our operating expenses in the December quarter. Other income for the quarter was $4.2 million, impart due to an $8.5 million onetime recover of VAT taxes which was anticipated when we issued guidance last July. In Q2 we expect other income in expense to decline approximately $10 million resulting in a net chare of $6 million as the interest expense on our long term that exceed the expected deals on our marketable securities. The non-GAAP tax rate was 36.7% in the quarter, almost seven points higher than the 30% range we discussed in the call last quarter. This unanticipated increase the roles because of investment declines and our deferred compensation program which are not deductible for income tax purposes but are included in pretax income. Investment balances in this program are formerly, fairly stable and historically the effective changes in the investment portfolio have impacted our tax rate by less than one percentage point. Presuming a recent volatility in equity market size we would expect this tax rate effect to return to prior level. Looking forward to Q2 more pretax profit combined with the impact of recently US legislation renewing the R&D tax credit will increase volatility and our tax rate which will make it more difficult to forecast. In the December quarter our projected tax rate will be between 0 and 10%, in the long run we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to return into 30% range. Non-GAAP net income was $35 million and $0.32 per share in Q1. These numbers include stock-based compensation of almost $28 million. In the December quarter we expect expenses for stock based compensation to be approximately $25 million. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, a decrease of $273 million quarter-to-quarter. Cash flow from operations was $81 million in Q1 versus a $188 million in Q4 of ’08. During Q1 we repurchased a $177 million of stock, we paid a cash dividend of $26 million, and we used a $127 million in net cash to acquire MIE. Accounts receivable ended the quarter at $370 million down $122 million from the third quarter. MIE added $15 million to the quarter end balance, MDA sellers were 80 days versus 83 days at the end of June. Inventory increased by $44 million in the last quarter, including $36 million from the MIE acquisition and ended the quarter at $504 million. Net capital expenditures were $10 million, $7 million within core business and the remainder to the MIE acquisition. Fully diluted shares in Q1 were just over a 174 million, versus a 178 million shares in Q4. In the December quarter fully diluted share are expected to be about 172 million. Total headcount ended the quarter 6306 and increase of 246 from June acquisition. The MIE acquisition added 344 people and this is partially offset by a 98 reduction in the rest of KLA during Q1. Funding our visibility demand for semiconductor based product is limited. At this point we don’ not expect any meaningful capacity related spending to occur for the remainder calendar year and into early 2009. KLA’s non-fundamentals are compelling and we are confident in our new product pipeline for KLA Tencor and acquired businesses. We remain cautious in the near term outlook given the uncertainties surrounding the next few quarter and we expect new orders in the December quarter will be technology focused consumer to the level we experienced in Q1. We are adjusting our near term revenue expectations downward, and we will continue to run a company later design to maintain sufficient backlog in key research and development investment. For the same, we are undertaking a number of measures which aim low a clearly operating expense run rate to the 165 to $170 million range over the next nine months. These measures will be broadbased and focused on acquisition synergies, administrative support, sales and channel efficiency, operation and non-core engineering activities. Due to the timing of these actions as well as other legal and contractual factors, there will not be significant cost reduction in the December quarter. However, we do expect to see progress in these efforts beginning in the March quarter. In summary, our guidance for Q2 hits. New orders are expected to be flat plus or minus 10% versus Q1. Total revenue between $410 and $430 million and non-GAAP EPS which include stock based compensation that excludes onetime charges in the amortization will be approximately breakeven plus or minus $0.2. This concludes our prepared remarks on the quarter, and we will now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood - Senior Director of Investor Relations:  Okay, thank you. At this point we would like to open up the call to Q&A and we ask once again to please request that you limit yourself one question given the limited time we have today. Please feel to re-queue for your followup and we will do our best to get everyone on todays call. Operator we are ready for our first question.
Operator: [Operator Instruction]. Your first question comes from Jay Deahna with J.P. Morgan. You line is open sir.
Jay Deahna:
 :
Richard Wallace: Sure, yeah it will be my pleasure to say, absolutely there has been a focus on market share on our side over the past several quarters as you mentioned. We continue to do well and I think that this environment has changed somewhat our strategy and that many time our customer have reduced CapEx budgets. So you will find that there are occasions when we are providing capability and perhaps reconfigure it, or taking off some options of the tool and avert in the certain price points. More limited by driven by our customers need to really meet their budget. From an overall market share, we are pleased with our physician and how we have done, but in this kind of environment you have to battle for every order and then at certainly what we are out there doing.
Jay Deahna: So when the market share gets recorded for this year, and the spring of next year do you expect you share to be higher or lower or about the same as it was last year. And are you actually experiencing any pricing or potential margin pressures as a result of competition that you would deal with at normal?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, I think that we don’t expect to see market share decline. As I said sometimes there are some cases where we reconfigure tools to provide capability, those could result in having a short term margin impact that you get back in the long term when you provide upgrades. So balancing overtime we don’t see that being a significant factor for us. But there is definitely a increase competitive landscape based on the fact that there is not as much buying and customer have more time to evaluate tools.
Jay Deahna: Okay. and then lastly, can you given us an update on your move to Singapore and what the impact is on your margins now and what is expected to be in the next cycle compared to what they would be if you maintain your domestic manufacturing? 
Richard Wallace: Absolutely, sure. The products that we moved to Singapore and they are now assembled products, but most of them are relatively higher volume oriented to our capacity buys. So when we were running at higher revenue levels then we had said we got about 100 basis points out of the move to Singapore. Actually has revenues come down as we are forecasting in this slowdown, that affect is somewhat minimized by the fact that we are just running over volumes. However, when we reaccelerate in the next cycle that’s when we expect to see the 200 basis points that we originally had forecasted for that move. But we are not going to see that until we come out of the other end of this downturn.
Jay Deahna: Okay. Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Thank Jay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open sir.
Jim Covello: Guys, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. If I could ask about the cash and the plans on the buyback on one hand the stock is down a lot, so if you are buying back stock before. Obviously, this looks like a attractive level to you. On the other hand, you want to manage the cash balance in this environment. So how you will balance those you know, to stands your e question. And then if I can just ask my followup at a time. And its kind of follow up on a Jay's question relative to -- can you talk a little bit about the technology competitiveness. I understand that you are deconfiguring systems telling customers instead of budgetary constraints, but what are the issues you are dealing with on a competitive environment, both against reticle inspection and break field inspection? Thanks so much.
Richard Wallace: Sure Jim. Good questions. First on the buyback, yeah we have been, we do buyback shares in the last quarter. However in the last few weeks and we have curtailed our buyback as we look out -- and this is so much economic uncertainty, we have curtailed that in anticipation just trying to get better clarity on what's going on. And so in terms of the longer term macro affects. So right now we are in a mode of concerning cash given the current environment and certainly we will be in a position to return back to our mode of buying back shares once we get better clarity. But right now there is just seeing, so that uncertainty, but we thought that was the most prudent thing to do. In terms of the competitive front and the technology that we are seeing, not really a big difference, as I mentioned in the prior question of Jay, you know, we do see competitive pressure, we always see competitive pressure and it’s get tightened in an environment where people have more time to evaluate tools. We do see the differentiation and the new tools that we brought on in reticle Inspection the WPI options that we have added to 5X devices gotten very good attraction in the market and we have some extensions to our roadmap as well as new products that we are working on. So we fell very good about our technology position. We also think that for our competitors its going to be increasingly challenging to maintain their investment levels as we go through this down turn. In terms of bright field again good progress there. We feel very confident in the latest what we have seen in terms of market share evaluations. We continue to differentiate and for many other customer the buys that they have right now are really technology focused. And so it does on one hand they are short on capital on the other hand they really want to make sure they get the best possible and that’s why we believe that our market share is holding up in this environment.
Jim Covello: Great. Thank you so much.
Richard Wallace: Thanks Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citi. Your line is open sir.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi, two things. Number one, Rick can you give us shipments and can you give us what you think shipment will be in December. And then I had a second question?
Richard Wallace: Yeah sure, actually I will let Mark, handle that one.
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, shipments for the quarter were about 420 million Tim. We are not over guiding the shipment number into December, simply because it’s not a particularly meaningful leading indicator of exactly what the revenue follow on is going to be. But we will continue to guide the order flow and the revenue numbers. The 420 was the shipping number for the quarter we just completed.
Timothy Arcuri: I am sorry. Why would shipments not be a good indicator of what the future revenue is going to be?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, because there are a wide variety of different possibilities as window shipments can turn into revenue. And the shipment is not necessarily a short term leading indicator of exactly when those orders are going to turn into revenue. And for the time being at least we think it is prudent to not guide that exclusively, especially with the economic uncertainty that’s out there.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. I guess, you know, question for you Rick. Maybe I misheard you answered from the first question. But it seemed it just -- my question is around the profitability versus market share. And I guess the last five maybe years or so, KLA would have never consider a cutting price to key market share. And I guess, answering the prior question, it sounds like you were maybe hinting or saying that in some cases you have done that and maybe that’s not what you meant to say it, but maybe I have misheard it, but I am wondering what your thought is around the kind of balance between profitability versus market share? Thanks.
Richard Wallace: Yeah, sure. Timothy, now I have been here for 20 years and this is absolutely what we have done in the past. When times are slower we tended to deconfigure tools in order to make sure that we have sockets and run the business. Longer term of course we get that profitability back, if there is any short term hit on that due to configurations. We also offer more split for our customer during this period of time. Now we think that that will translate again into the similar performance we had in the past. There is really no change in our operating model that more consistent with this part of the cycle.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital. Your line is open sir.
Richard Wallace: C.J.
Operator: Sir, your line is open. Since we have no response from C.J. Muse, we will go on to Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Satya Kumar: Yeah, hi, thanks. You know, just I was looking at your comments on bookings, you mentioned that into March, you don’t really expect the significant recovery. I suppose that your revenue levels this will address the 325 to 350 in the last quarter. Earlier on I think you mentioned that you expect to remain above breakeven to the first half next year, you are guiding to breakeven at $420 million run rate now, what type of OpEx would you expect to see in the first half or there is something else that’s helping maintain breakeven in the March quarter, can you explain the linearity of the cost reduction efforts?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, sure. We are taking action as we said in March prepared comments that we will get our fixed cost in the 165 to 170 range down from 209 in Q1, that’s the significant reduction. We also believe that we will be able to do better than 325 and 350 in revenue, but the lower modeling right now we believe that was a current plans that we have and where we still have backlog that we can utilize through this next couple of quarters that allows us to revenue slightly above bookings, we will be able to improve to fund our profitability as we go forward.
Satya Kumar: Dou you see 165 will get during this last quarter itself?
Mark Dentinger: 165 to 170 by the June quarter.
Richard Wallace: That will be the run rate at the end of the June quarter.
Satya Kumar: Okay. In terms of the gross margins since the December, I was wondering if you could quantify that a little bit more, I guess, like a 500 basis points decline in the gross margins from September to December to get to your breakeven sort of EPS levels. How much of that is the changes in pricing and how much of that is volumes subscribing that?
Mark Dentinger: Probably the biggest factor is actually next. So we have the series becomes the larger mix as we bring down the revenue, as you know, and from that strength of margin the other thought is we do have some happening in the near term, we’re also at this point still integrating the Vistec and the ICOS business which initially and totally work through some of the synergies will help margins that are dilutive to the overall model.
Satya Kumar: And lastly Rick, you inventory base went up quite significantly, it seems like it’s a higher level in the last 10 to 13 year something like that. Is this acquisition related, or is this also paid to this push offs that you are seeing, the additional ease out that you are providing to your customers now that you are classifying that as inventories, can you provide some granularity on that?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, as I said 80% of the inventory increase was related to bring on, the balance sheet of the MEI Vistec acquisition for the quarter. The balance of the increase was very nominal, and of course, we are catching up as a downturn real time and we would expect to control that number going forward fairly carefully. But most of the change in the quarter and most of what we drive the term slowdown was a function on bringing on the acquisitions.
Satya Kumar: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes form Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir.
Steve O'Rourke: Thank you good afternoon. And just as a source as a follow on to the last question, I think last call you talked a bit about inventory from data shipments in the field, how much was out there and when you expected to turn?
Richard Wallace:  Yeah, the inventory data shipments are not calculated in our backlog that is true, and we would expect to beta returns to turn with the rest of the business at approximately the same levels we had experience with everything that’s going on right now, which means that they will probably turn a little bit slower in light of the downturn then they might have historically during a upturn. And visa versa where there would upturn return you could expect to see those flip a little faster?
Steve O'Rourke:  Do you have a higher number of data shipment in the field or data tools in the field then you normally do?
Richard Wallace:  At this phase we have a number of new product introductions, yes that’s true.
Steve O'Rourke:  Okay. And one a followup on a separate fund, you talked about technology buys only in orders, and if I understand the numbers correctly in your prepared remark. If I back out service it sounds like what I call maintenance equipment spending is about $200 million for KLA in the quarter. One is that that like we had think about it? And two, do you think maintenance CapEx is kind of trending down when you consider number of customer for example?
Richard Wallace: No, I mean, right, now it is correct, now I don’t its trending down. There is just such very little spending out of the foundry sector and out of the memory sector last quarter and it was certainly dominated really the logic stand. So the other guys I think didn’t. In these times they tend to be pretty lumpy. So I think that’s part of what we are seeing, but overall I don’t see it coming down, I see there is some pressure to go up, I wouldn’t say its materially going up overtime, but I don’t think it’s the right time do you think $200 million number is kind of a pretty good maintenance CapEx number based upon your business now?
Mark Dentinger: That’s similar to the way we are looking at next couple of quarters, yeah.
Steve O'Rourke: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open sir.
Gary Hsueh: Hey, thank you. That’s Gary Hsueh. Rich, just a quick question to revisit this competition decontenting sort of issue that was brought up. If I look at memory as a percent of the total and absolute value, I just have never seen memory bookings in any one quarter reaching level this low for your guys. And just by way of comparison, in 2002 and 2003, your memory orders by math hit a trough of around $60 million and that’s when TMSC was spending on average roughly about $1.3 billion in CapEx. I know like this year, TMSC is still spending 1.8 billionish in CapEx and they are ratcheting it down to 1.4 billion. So the CapEx environment is arguably a little bit better. But why are we seeing such a lower foundry order number? Is it because the share loss the foundries or is it because of decontenting or is it simply because foundries are seeing less of a need here for inspection and metrology?
Richard Wallace: So I guess, lastly Gary, you are talking about memory and then you switched to foundry?
Gary Hsueh: I am just focusing on foundry. I am just wondering why your foundry orders are at these low levels, levels that haven’t seen before even in ’02, ’03 when the CapEx environment was pretty much the same?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, sure. Well, foundry was 35% in June, Gary and 6% in September and we think it’s back to 15% in December. So I think it’s hard to realign into one quarter’s data on this because it ends up being pretty lumpy. And look across 2008, there is no question that process control has outperformed other sectors in terms of the foundries, which have been generally very down. As you know, the way foundry guys report, they report revenues different than the actual bookings that are going on. So we are talking about when we get these numbers of bookings on. I am quite sure there are very few orders placed in the September quarter out of the foundries.
Gary Hsueh: Okay. So just once again, just the orders up to $20 million level going to the roughly on the $50 million level compared to a trough of $60 million in ’02, ’03, it’s just the lumpiness in the foundry business, nothing else?
Richard Wallace: Well, I think that you will find out one of the foundry players, their CapEx, the other guys actually have been pretty constrained in their spend. So I think one of the questions will be, will there will be broader spending overall from foundries, but there is no question that foundries with utilizations where they are right now and their expectation on demand have been very constrained on their capital.
Gary Hsueh: Okay. And just my last followup here. What do you think is the mix in your orders in December between memory and logic since you provided foundry?
Richard Wallace: Sure. We think logic is probably about 55% and we see memory about 31%. On top of all of that we have 25%, which is non-semi.
Gary Hsueh: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open sir.
Brett Hodess: I know that you said you are going to need your cost structure down to 165, 170 fixed cost range by the end of next June and that includes all of the acquisitions at that stage. Can you talk a little bit about what your gross margin structure will look like once you get these things all integrated, so what the need break-even level might be overall?
Richard Wallace: Sure Brett. I think there is a couple of things. One, obviously some of the things we are doing in cost exposure, the 165, the 170 we are talking about fixed cost. Obviously, we are also working hard to reduce the overhang that we have, the overhead that we have in the gross margin line. When we model whole thing out that we break-even somewhere between 350 and 400 million in terms of revenue. And depending on – we think the June quarter is when we can get our fixed cost down in the 165 range.
Brett Hodess: So exiting the June quarter and 350 to 400 will be break-even?
Richard Wallace: Correct.
Brett Hodess: Okay. And if you look at the impact of mix, you talked earlier on margin. Is the impact bigger across your semiconductor equipment portfolio or is it more an issue of the mix between obviously no services, lower gross margin, but the other markets that you are going into now, some of the LED, solar, back-end and things like that.
Richard Wallace: Yeah. It’s really hard to say different products at different points have different margins based on new product, old product. I would say it’s pretty close to being the same. In general, the gross margins often a function of Just getting cost out of the system and less dependent on the existing market. When we take acquisitions in, we find there is a number of things that we can do to reduce their cost but it just takes a little time to do that. Several other things we get, for example, just out of our leverage of our buying and that’s one way that just the procurement side we can reduce our cost and drive up margins and acquire businesses.
Brett Hodess: Thank you.
Richard Wallace: Thanks Brett.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krishna Shankar with Banc of America. Your line is open sir.
Krishna Shankar: Hello guys. Can you hear me?
Richard Wallace: Yes.
Krishna Shankar: Well, I have got a couple of quick questions. How do you think about KLA Tencor going forward into the next three to four quarters. Is this 130 million run rate sustainable or do you think there is going to be some modest growth in it? And then I have a followup.
Richard Wallace: Sure, Krish. There is no question that our customers while they are constraining their capital, most of them are trying to do everything they can to get cash out of their existing assets, which means running their factory, which means creating the opportunity for service. So we do see some opportunity to grow the service business in this environment. On the other hand, it’s also an environment where our customers are really looking for cost and efficiency improvements. So we have to improve our operating model and service as well in order to see the revenue growth in order to continue to build that business over time. But yes, we do think we can grow off our current levels.
Krishna Shankar: If I look at the bookings in the quarter and then the mix you provided for memory and foundry, it’s sort of pretty low level. So heading into calendar ’09, which do you think is actually going to turn around, back to normalized levels? Is going to be foundry that’s going to turn around or memory?
Richard Wallace: Krish, we are not predicting. I have no idea given the macro environment that we are in right now. You got to talk to customers and they are all I think scratching their heads trying to figure out where that’s coming. What you would say if you just back off and you went on fundamentals and not factoring the macro economic situation, you would say that the foundry guys are under-investing relative to the needs to go to advanced design rules. And at the same time the memory guys while they were heavily investing are certainly in a period now of under-investing as well and they will want to ramp up their advance design rules. But when and how that catalyst hits, we really don’t know, which is why we are sizing the business the way we are.
Krishna Shankar: Okay. And just a last question. In the December guidance, you said that full quarter of the MIE business, how much the drag in terms of basis points is it on the gross margins, is it like a 50 basis points or 100 basis points drag?
Mark Dentinger: Well, I did indicated in the prepared remarks that there is about $24 million in OpEx that will come in as a result of both the Vistec and the MIE acquisitions in the December quarter. So you can figure from that, if approximately half of that would be, you probably get about a two point effect.
Krishna Shankar: And what were the gross margin line, the OpEx is that 24 million?
Mark Dentinger: It’s still dilutive at the gross margin line, but the exact percentage is hard to figure it out.
Richard Wallace: And again, as I said, our goal over time is to get it so there won’t be and we believe we have plans in place, that’s just going to take some time.
Krishna Shankar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is open sir.
Stephen Chin: Hey, great. Thanks. Maybe to help out on these Reticle inspection questions and maybe you can give us an idea of how many customers have taken KLA’s new reticle inspection product, I think you call up this side as Wafer Plane Inspections roll in. When do you think that Reticle inspection will be 10% of sale?
Richard Wallace: Okay. So the WPI, Stephen here is not a new tool, it’s an application and upgrade to the existing installed base to the 5XX. So we have a lot of sockets out there where we can provide that upgrade and that provides additional capability. I don’t have the specific numbers of how many, but we are definitely seeing a large adoption. One of the attractions that it has for our customers is it is a relatively low cost ways to improve the capability. So in this environment, we do see adoption of it. However, that being said, the Reticle guys are not in a mode of heavy spending at this point. And so, on one hand it’s attractive, on the other hand they are pretty constrained with their capital as well.
Stephen Chin: Okay. Just another followup question on the questions about Singapore. I guess I didn’t you understand, are you planned to accelerate the product to move out to Singapore or are you thinking about halting this product move to Singapore temporarily and the impact to gross margin there.
Richard Wallace: Yeah, we are not changing our plans at all. What's changed is given the volume of the overall business, the effect of the Singapore operation is less in a declining revenue environment than it is when we're accelerating and growing. Since most of the buys we said are technology-oriented buys at this phase, those are not products that are typically built in a high volume manufacturing environment like Singapore. Those come more out of the California because they are radical cools, high end wafer inspection tools. So that changes the impact Singapore will have. It will be most impactful when we're back to a higher volume environment.
Stephen Chin: But no change to the schedule of how the products get outsourced out there?
Richard Wallace:  No, no change.
Stephen Chin:  Okay. The last question I have is on the balance sheet cash. Since you said you're curtailing the stock buyback. You also have plans to curtail the dividend payment?
Richard Wallace:  We don't have any plans right now to change the dividend payment.
Stephen Chin: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from (Inaudible) Malik, you are line is open sir.
Malik:  Hi thanks for taking my questions. The BB&T market is quite fragmented. There are a bunch of smaller players. Are you seeing any indication from your customers that they are concerned about those guys – they want to take business to you guys? And then I have a follow-up.
Richard Wallace:  I'm sorry. Which market -- do you mean process control?
Malik: Yes.
Richard Wallace:  Oh, yeah. And concerns about our customers about dealing with smaller players?
Malik: Right.
Richard Wallace: Yeah, I think that's definitely true. And in this environment, one of the concerns a lot of customers have is the economic viability of their supply chain and so we are absolutely seeing that from our customers, as that's one of the things that we're finding that it affects us in two ways. One, we've been asked to look at some distressed assets, and the other is when we are dealing with customers, we are finding that's a differentiator for us.
Malik: And then can you comment on your acquisition appetite? I mean I understand where in balance sheet there cash preservation mode, but can you comment on that and do you consider EDS based to be a adjacent to your core competency?
Richard Wallace: I would say from an appetite perspective, we're in the I did just in phase right now having just quite in this debt and while we're always open to opportunities there were out there right now I think the focus for us is to integrate the acquisitions that we've recently done and to focus on our core businesses and streamline our cost structure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria, your line is open, sir.
Mahesh Sanganeria:  Thanks very much. I'm a little bit confused about the operating expense questions. If you can give some clarifications. First, to start with, in your EPS guidance, is that pro forma and exclude the amortization of intangibles?
Richard Wallace:  Yes. It excludes the amortization of intangibles, but it does include the stock-based compensation.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay, so what is your recurring amortization of intangibles going forward? You added a lot of intangibles to your book.
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, we amortized about 7 million this quarter on a recurring basis and we added $33 million in one-time charges associated with the MIE acquisition this quarter. So you can figure that going forward, it will be something north of the seven as we start to amortize the amortizable portion of the MIE acquisition.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay, and for your target for 165 to 170 in fix fixed costs, does that include stock option expense and amoritization and -- or is that excluding that?
Mark Dentinger:  Consistent with how we actually present the numbers on a non-GAAP basis, it would include stock-based compensation, but it would exclude the – effect ignitable.
Mahesh Sanganeria: And so what is that number as of today, the fixed cost? What is the run rate right now?
Mark Dentinger: We reported in this quarter, I believe it was about $209 million, but we did indicate that there were certain phenomenon associated with the acquisitions that we're still digesting, so you can figure that we're moving from the 209 to a run rate of 165 to 170 by the end of Q4.
Mahesh Sanganeria: The number you reported was OpEx, not -- is that what you are calling fixed costs also?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, unfortunately, that's true. They are interchangeable. It's really the operating expenses as you read down the income statement.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay and you said that you are going to increase by how much for the December quarter?
Mark Dentinger: It will decrease slightly. We estimated about $5 million.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay, thank you. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth. Your line is open, sir, and he is from Cohen and company.
Raj Seth: Rick, can you talk little bit about the pace of technology transitions in the industry, any change at all in this kind of environment? Clearly in logic over the last couple of years if you look at starts, the distribution of people at various notes has broadened, but are you seeing each at the leading edge any kind of change in the speed with which people are adopting new technology? Thanks.
Richard Wallace: Yeah, Raj, not in development, certainly not the customers we're talking to, and I've been on the field quite a bit lately. And what I'm finding is that's the one conversation everybody's excited to have, is their work on Advanced Technology. When you talk about capacity, it's a different conversation, but there's a lot of push towards getting to the next technology node. Certainly among customers that I've talked to in both memory and foundry and logic, all three, their focus is how do we get to the next node, even if they have very constrained capital, that seems to be the one area that they continue to be focused on.
Raj Seth: Any of these guys thinking about skipping nodes, you know, where there's not enough volume, I don't know, at 35, looked like it's just kind of skipping, at least in logic?
Richard Wallace: Well, there's one major player who has talked about half nodes and I'm sure you're aware of that.
Raj Seth: Yeah.
Richard Wallace: The 40-nanometer, so there's certainly that talk. I think that's more of a decision, at least what I'm seeing, is based on what the fabless guys are looking for less so than what the customers were directly talking to. We seem to be very focused on getting to their next node. And I've had a number of meetings recently where people are talking about their 3 X, but also their 2 X technology nodes and, you know, the plan is to continue those investments. I do think that you're right. There are some fabless guys that have looked and are considering doing, at least skipping half a node.
Raj Seth: And last question, if I could, lamb in their call talked about their expectation whenever it is we returned to more normalized spending levels, that capital intensity in this industry is probably more like 16 to 18%, obviously inflated in the recent past because of the memory cycle. Do you subscribe to that view, or do you have a view of your own?
Richard Wallace: I, I think that the 17%, the midpoint of that is a reasonable number. When I do our long-term modeling, when I think long-term, I actually think there are factors to push it up and there are ones to push it down, as I think 17% is not a bad number. I do think you will occasionally, and who knows what the next one will be. You'll find there's increased entries into the market which for some period of time may drive that number higher as we saw in memory, but from a going forward kind of average level, I do think 17% is a reasonable number.
Raj Seth: Right. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse, with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Can you hear me now?
Mark Dentinger: Hi, CJ.
C.J. Muse: I guess first question, in terms of the service business, what kind of growth do you think we could see here in calendar '08 and I guess given more subdued outlook now for the industry, what kind of growth do you think also for calendar '09?
Mark Dentinger: Well, calendar '08's not a the lot left, so I think we're pretty close on that one. You know, what we said I think at Semicon is we've been seeing growth in the 11 to 14% range over time. I would expect that to slow in the, in calendar '09 and probably higher single digits would be the growth rate I would see because there's clearly pressure from customers to manage all their expense, including service. But we still think it's a growth business, but probably somewhat slower, then resuming once we see overall industry pick up.
C.J. Muse: Can you elaborate on what's driving the growth? We're seeing from plenty of other equipment companies where that's declining year on year and I guess is that installed base coming off warranty, offering other services, is it some of the acquisitions coming in? Can you help me understand the growth a little bit better?
Richard Wallace: Sure, CJ. Our business is different from service perspective than many of our peers, and the reason for that is we don't sell consumable. And so I think what a lot of -- what they see is consumable will reduce in periods of slowing where ours is really line fix and we have a larger installed base. The other thing that's driven some of our growth recently is we acquired companies that have large install base that weren't offering services for those and we're actually able to bring value to that and drive that. Additionally driving increased services as we go forward, and even including some upgrade opportunities for the more mature tool sets. So I think all those factors differentiate our service and make its counseling story in this kind of environment.
C.J. Muse: Good. Great. Into some other acquisition, what kind of revenue contribution should we see for ICOS and Vistec in Q4 or down the Q4?
Richard Wallace: Yeah, we don’t write them out, but I would say that those businesses are seeing similar kind of pressures to what we are seeing elsewhere. One think I am kind of striking is the solar business for example, we are seeing pressure in that market as well as I think the capital concerns are some of the solar companies are delaying actually some solar project. So I think there is a good solar business and we see some growth in that and catching near term is under a fair amount of pressure. We don’t break it out, but I would say its kind of consistent with what those business is gaining with the applied factor everybody else of the effects of the downturn if that make sense?
C.J. Muse: Correct. And then last housekeeping. You might have said, and I apologize if you have, could you tell me what the backlog and deferred revenues were actually in the quarter?
Mark Dentinger: Yeah, the total backlog at the end of the quarter was $811 million and we split that $250 million into the shippable backlog and 561ish in the orders taken but not shift yet
C.J. Muse: Okay, and that doesn’t include, that’s just product on the new service?
Mark Dentinger:  That’s right, we always different we reported that.
C.J. Muse: Great thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from Mary Lee with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.

Richard P. Wallace: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for our Q4 earnings call this afternoon. Today I'll discuss highlights of our fiscal year '08 performance, I'm talking about the June quarter and give an update on the current market environment. Lastly, I'll provide guidance for the September quarter. KLA-Tencor advanced our market and technology leadership in FY '08. We executed our growth strategy both organically and through M&A. We improved our cost structure. We generated strong cash flow and returned value to shareholders. Revenue in FY '08 was $2.5 billion down 8% year-over-year. Net income including share based comp but excluding one time a deal related cost was $512 million or $2.78 per diluted share. We generated approximately $668 million in cash flow from operations and were active in returning value to shareholders in the year, repurchasing just over $1.1 billion in common stock and paying cash dividends of approximately $109 million. I'd like to highlight some key developments in FY '08 in context of our four strategic objectives which are customer focus, growth, operational excellence and talent. As most of you know, at KLA-Tencor we solve mission critical, production problems for our customers. We do that by delivering a portfolio of differentiated solutions, utilizing both inspection and metrology. Our tools help our customers increase their ROI and keep pace with the increasing complexity of the old requirements in advanced technology nodes. Today we are market leaders in 20 of the 22 markets that we serve. We do that as a result of our higher level investment in innovation and close collaboration with our customers, that enabled us to anticipate their future needs and develop appropriately bringing technology when it's needed. Our goal is to leverage our leadership in financial resources to deliver long term growth, at least 5% faster than the industry. And although, our revenue was down in FY '08, our relative performance exceeded this 5% goal. We're well positioned to continue to out pace industry growth, through a comprehensive product portfolio and our product road map which will address the future challenges our customers face, at 45- nanometers and beyond. In terms of our growth objective, the increasing complexity of advance design rules, just feeling [ph] growth in our core inspection metrology markets. And this is based on the fact that the new processes require more and complicated and difficult inspection. We are modeling an increase potential of 30% in the revenue opportunity as we transition from 45 to 32-nanometer nodes when we look back and compare to the 65 to 45-nanometer transition. We'll look back, our Q4 orders about 75% of those were 45-nanometers, pilot lines and development. On the strategic growth front, in June, we completed the acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems, furthering our expansion in the new markets both back-end package inspection, solar and high brightness LED. And yesterday, we announced the intent to acquire the Microelectronic Inspection Equipment Business of Vistec Semiconductor Systems. This business has product leadership and mass registration and that CD metrology compliments our own leadership in mask inspection and strengthens our product roadmap to address future market opportunities, particularly the double-patterning lithography. Additionally, the business has highly regarded legacy for developing precision and inspection and metrology equipment that will compliment and enhance KLA-Tencor's own core competencies, when the process of securing regulatory approval for this acquisition and subject to those approvals, we expected to close within the next few months. We will continue to execute our M&A strategy as a key component of our long term growth objective. We're also continuously focusing on improving our business model. Today we're driving many initiatives worldwide as a result of structural changes we've put in place two years ago, to improve our profitability by optimizing our global footprint and enhancing our organizational efficiency. These changes have began to bear fruits and today our model is performing better in terms of profitability than it has at comparable revenue levels in the past even in this down market. Of course, none of this is possible without world-class talent within KLA-Tencor. We've worked very hard to attract, develop and retain an outstanding workforce. And we've been successful in building our team and I am especially proud of the performance of the entire team during fiscal year '08. In summary, we are pleased with our execution in '08, and what's been a very challenging year for semiconductor equipment manufacturers, our strategy is working, and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead as we help our customers continue to tackle difficult yield issues as they adopt new technology. Turning now to reveal the fourth quarter. In general, we continue to operate in a difficult demand environment and visibility remains poor. There are some bright spots however, the market leaders continue to invest in technology development and to drive design rules down. The business is down in all our major markets and across all product lines as the semiconductor industry works to resolve an excess capacity condition, while facing increased headwinds from four macroeconomic conditions and diminished end user demand. Despite this weak demand conditions, we continue to execute well financially in the period, with the June quarter revenue coming in above the range of guidance of $591 million, and net income excluding some one-time charges was at the top of the range of $0.60 per share. Cash flow was also strong as we generated approximately $188 million in cash from operations in the quarter. Bookings for the June quarter came in at $469 million down 15% from March. At our Analyst Day in June we said that we saw order timing pushing out late in the quarter with order volume trending to the bottom end of the range guidance. In the final weeks of the quarter we experienced a further slowdown with orders that we're originally expecting to see in June pushing out to the December quarter and beyond. However, Q4 was another good quarter for logics demand as customers continue to drive investment in 45 nanometer build out and 32 nanometer development. Logic was 46% of the bookings in the quarter foundries grew sequentially and was 35% of the orders in the fourth quarter, as foundries continue to build out their 45 nanometer capacity. Memory was approximately 19% of orders in Q4, well below recent results due to push outs from the end customers and continued restraint in DRAM spending. Demand [ph] was 29% of memory orders in the quarter. Looking ahead in the second half of calendar '08, the outlook for near term recovery and orders is muted. Although we expect some pockets to strength among our large customers as they invest in development of advanced best design roles, the global economic weakness continues to dampen end user demand, for hi-tech products as we remain cautious in our expectations for a broad based recovery in the second half. In this tough environment we are driving the formal [ph] key factors to enable continued strength in our market leadership. We are focusing on our customer experience, we're maintaining a high level of investment and innovation. And we are improving our cost structure to drive a better business model performance and deliver high returns to our shareholders. All these efforts position us well to capitalize and growth when the cycle conditions improve. Now I would like to discuss some key products and competitive highlights from the quarter. First, in defect inspection, technology and product differentiation continues to enable market leadership to the company. We had another strong quarter of Brightfield adoption in Q4 placing 28xx full spectrum Brightfield tools with industry leaders in both foundry and memory. Our Brightfield portfolio is unparallel in the marketplace and delivering advance capability required to find the killer defects in critical patterning layers while outperforming competitive technologies and trends of sensitivity, defect capture and speed [ph]. In reticle inspection we continue to drive our product development roadmap. Some time earlier this month we introduced the latest version of our computation lithography tool called as the 11. This new tool and the industry leading product line is the only lithography stimulator capable of modeling topography and predicting in fact specific to double patterning for 32 nanometers. This provides an essential tool for reticle manufacturers to control their development cost without having to commit the resources of a mass shop. We continue to invest heavily in our reticle business to address and speaking complexity of a reticle manufactures at advanced design roles and creating opportunities for KLA-Tencor. In metrology KLA-Tencor continues to be the market leader by offering a comprehensive suite of metrology products to offer customers the ability to maintain tighter controls of their process window. In the June quarter our next generation overlay metrology platform the RII-200 [ph] was chosen as tool of record with the logic customers for 32-nanometer production demonstrating superior performance in production environment over an extensive five month evaluation period. RII-200 features an enhanced optical system that provides significant performance improvement, that are critical to helping customers to meet the much tighter overlay requirements, the double patterning lithography at the 32-nanometer design role node. These are just a few examples of our market successes in the quarter each an indication of continued emphasis on delivering an outstanding customer experience and delivering superior customer experience, in best in breed [ph] technology KLA-Tencor creates a significant competitive advantage that translates the strong market leadership, revenue growth and profitability. Moving on to the September quarter guidance keep in mind September is typically seasonally down for KLA-Tencor, the bookings being down sequentially, an EBIT loss to 11 years. Given the poor demand environment today we expect the same pattern to repeat in Q1 '09 we are projecting bookings for Q1 to be down 15% with a range of plus or minus 10%. Revenues expected to be between $510 million and $525 million and EPS in the range of $0.32 to $0.36 including stock-based compensation and excluding one-time charges. With that now I'll turn the call over to John Kispert.
John Kispert: Thanks, Rick. Revenue for the quarter was $591 million and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.60 the difference between the GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS numbers are as follows; first acquisition related charges of $50.4 million or $0.22 after tax is related to the acquisition of ICOS Vision System. Second, stock option restatements related charges of $2.7 million or $0.01 after tax finally there were two benefits, first a net gain of $1.4 million related to the sales buildings that was partially offset by some restructuring severance charges and second, a non-recurring tax gain of $8.4 million or $5.50 after tax. In summary, this totals to $0.17 of after tax adjustments and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60. In our press release you will find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation which covers the non-GAAP adjustments I've just mentioned in more detail. The remainder of my comments in the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments I just mentioned, but does include stock-based compensation which is reflective of the financial performance of KLA-Tencor is how we run the business and enabled the transparent comparison of results across peers and amongst peers. As previously mentioned we completed our acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems at the end of May, so the results for this June quarter include ICOS operations for one month, and for this month ICOS's revenue was $9 million and its impact on gross margins and EPS was dilutive. Excluding ICOS revenues for KLA-Tencor was $582 million slightly above the guidance range provided in April of $560 million to $580 million and earnings per share was $0.60, which is at the top end of the guidance range of $0.56 to $0.60. This is a solid quarter for KLA-Tencor in terms of financial performance and operational execution. However, as we discussed in early June and again just a few weeks ago the ordering environment significantly weakened as the quarter progressed. A number of expansions for the period started in April pushed out one after the other through May and then accelerated in June and as a result net orders for the quarter was $469 million that's down 15% from the March ending quarter and at the low end of our guidance range. The slowing demand environment we first began to experience late in September quarter of last year continues in each of our markets. And it declined further over last few months. And now make instability is continuing to additionally [ph] impact the demand for our customers' product and as a result it is clearly affecting their capital investment decisions, both in size and in timing. While their pockets in strength driven by customers continuing to focus on new technology development for next generation production nodes. Most of our customers are in an aggressive capital preservation mode and are eliminating their equipment investment to only the most critical applications. Our market position in all markets is consistent with the last several quarters. In short we are winning the orders but not just that many of them. The regional distribution of orders is as follows; the US was 37%, Europe is 7%, Japan with 17% Korea is 15% Taiwan was 7% and the rest of Asia with 18%. The approximate distribution of orders by market was wafer inspection approximately 30%, reticle inspection approximately 10%, metrology approximately 19% and services approximately 27%. Storage, solar energy and other non-semi add up to be approximately 4%. With customers of spending capital it is at a lending ends technology node. In semiconductor 45 nanometer and below development in product activity, investments were roughly 75% of our orders received in the quarter. In total we ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of backlog. This dollar amount is after backlog adjustments for order [indiscernible] acquisition related adjustments and in-door foreign exchange impact. We break this backlog into what is shipped and what is not. The break down is as follows; $715 million of shipment backlog orders that have not yet shipped to customers we expect to ship over the next six to nine months. And $364 million of revenue backlog [indiscernible] and in voice but have not yet been signed off by customers. Keep in mind, that we do not include any service contracts in this backlog. Looking forward, as we have said in the last couple of conference call, visibility into a meaningful time in the business continues to be low. Similar to June, a number of significant memory, foundry and wafer expansions in the sales funnel for the September quarter have now pushed out other [ph] September quarter against the backend of the calendar year. In addition, the September quarter is historically been seasonally down quarter KLA-Tencor. Given these factors we do not anticipate a sequential turn in the September quarter. And as a result we will continue to run the business in a very conservative manner and so visibility into a turn is clear. Recently we updated you in detail on our progress, on a number of operational initiatives, that enable higher profitability, improved operational flexibility and operating cash flow. Those with our historical performance at various revenue level will improve, while preserving our investments in the research and development and customer support. These initiatives around globalization, product development and acquisition integration are now beginning to favorable impact the business model for KLA-Tencor. These efforts are critical to positioning the company, to growing a mix cycle both organically and through the new markets we have acquired, at a lower operating expense to revenue ratio and without having made any significant capital investments beyond our current levels. Looking at our current income statement, we feel our team has executed [ph] extremely well against aggressive business model targets in a difficult environment. Revenues for the quarter were 591 million, this level is down 2% quarter-to-quarter and down 20% from the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.6% down 25 basis points for the March quarter. We continue to focus on size in our organizations for the current business level while maintaining capability to ramp new products globally. And of course, focus on possibly being able to respond to any rapid shift in demand when it occurs. In the September ending quarter, our systems revenue and shipments will both decline sequentially. We expect that quarter gross margins to decline in a similar incremental margins as the last few quarters. Keep in mind that we also need to continue to work through these acquisitions that currently carry diluted gross margins to our base business. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 193 million or up 3.5 million from the March quarter. R&D was 97.2 million, up 2.4 million from Q3. As we continue to invest in key research and development activity, and customer care relations for the next generation technology, irrespective of the business requirements. Our plan is, introduced [ph] 16 new products in the past twelve months and our plan is to introduce another 18 new products over the next eighteen months. SG&A for the quarter was 95.3 million, up slightly quarter-to-quarter, as we continue to focus on sales channel efficiency and elimination of acquisitions and redundancies. Our focus over the coming quarters will continue in this area, in the core business as we believe there are additional opportunities there. In the September quarter non-GAAP operating expenses will increase, say about 12 million to 15 million as we absorb a full quarter on the ICOS operations. We expect these expenses to decline from this point over next several quarters, as SG&A efficiency improvements in the core business partially offset the increase driven by our M&A activities. Non-GAAP other income for the quarter was 7.1 million, as earnings on our cash portfolio exceeded the interest expense associated with our mid-quarter debt offering. In the September ending quarter, we expect other income to decline to 3 million to 4 million, as we increased -- as the increase interest expense from our long term debts for the full quarter offsets the expected other income and increase on the investment portfolio that is lower due to weak interest environment. The pro forma tax rate was 28.6% in the quarter, lower than the 30% range that we've discussed in conference call last quarter, due to higher than expected revenue from products shipped from offshore facilities to non U.S. customers. Going forward, we expect the pro forma rate to be approximately 29% plus or minus 2 to 3 points. Non-GAAP net income was 107 million or $0.60 per diluted share. This number includes stock based compensation expenses of 29 million. In the September quarter, we expect expenses for stock based compensation to be roughly flat. Now let me turn to the balance sheet. Tax and investment ended the quarter at roughly 1.6 billion, an increase of 265 million quarter-to-quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 122 million of stock at an average price of $43 and paid a divided of 26 million. Tax from operations was 188 million in the quarter as we continue to leverage solid profitability and working capital management to enable predictable cash flow. For the fiscal year ending in June, operating cash flow increased by over 9%, at year ago [ph], when net income was down 21%. Inventory increased by 16 million quarter-to-quarter to 459 million. Note that ICOS added 33 million of inventory in the quarter. The company has continued to focus on reducing our cycle time, to lower inventory -- our inventory on hand requirements, short and long lead time material risk and improve our overall [indiscernible] utilization. As well we to respond very quick to customers needs, when the time is right. Cycles times across KLA-Tencor's prior portfolio, down 30% over the last 12 months. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at 492 million down 81 million from the prior quarter. ICOS added approximately 25 million to that number. Net fixed assets increased by 28 million, 10 million was actual capital expenditure within the core business and the remaining 18 million due to ICOS acquisition. So, again capital expenses were 10 million in the quarter. Pro forma depreciation was 14 million. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter at just over 178 million. For the June quarter, fully diluted shares are expected to be at about 175 million. Headcount ended the quarter at 6060. Finally as we commented earlier, the business environment continues to be challenging, both in terms of cyclical depth [ph] and duration. As we go, we remain extremely cautious in this environment. We believe that it is financially prudent to adjust our expected revenue down to more closely align with the current business level. While we continue to run the big company in a way that will enable us to maintain sufficient backlog and continuously make key investments and of course ensure sustained profitability in cash flow. Our guidance for the upcoming quarter does not include the impacts of our recently announced intent to acquire Microelectronic Inspection Equipment Business of Vistec Semiconductor Systems. With that to reiterate our guidance for the quarter is, bookings expected to be minus 15%, plus or minus 10 points, revenue between 510 million and 525 million and EPS including stock based compensation but excluding one time charges and amortization of $0.32 to $0.36. This concludes our remarks on the quarter and I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood: Okay. Thank you John. A good point, we would like to open the call for Q&A. And we once again request that you limit yourself to one question given the limited time we have today. Feel free to requeue for your follow-up questions and we'll do our best to get everyone in today's call. So, Christian, we are ready for our first question. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jay Deahna, with J.P. Morgan.
Jay Deahna: Good afternoon, how are you doing?
Richard P. Wallace: Hi Jay.
John Kispert: Hi.
Jay Deahna: Hi. A couple of years ago when pretty much all of your customers were buying, you guys were very bullish and were talking about at fairly lengthy cycle which pretty much started to drop, within the quarter of that commentary. And now that really nobody is buying and everybody is pushing out, you guys are sticking the knife in your stomach. So, I was just kind of wondering, if you look at it kind of objectively, at this point in the ball game, you talked about a lot of projects being pushed out over the last couple of months. Do you see a lot of projects left that are still at risk of being pushed out? Or do you think with the flash spending coming down recently, that we sort of flushed it out?
Richard P. Wallace: Yeah, right now Jay, as we look forward. I think September, as we said we are guiding September down and there still are some projects in there, so there is still some rest. But I would say overall, I think we've got a pretty good sense of September given the visibility we have now. But if your point is, could it come back stronger than, it's very hard to see that right now.
Jay Deahna: No, that's not really the point. The point is, are there a lot of projects out there at this point that would be viewed as highly riskier, kind of flushed out most of those.
Richard P. Wallace: I think many of them flushed out and as you know they tend to move out rather than and if that's what you mean, yeah. But there still is some risk, there is some risk in what people are forecasting for September and I think that people who see a strong December are just more bullish on the rift [ph].
Jay Deahna: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Richard P. Wallace: Brett?
Brett Hodess: Hello.
Richard P. Wallace: Hi there Brett.
Brett Hodess: Hi, good afternoon. I just wanted to check on some of the progress on margins at this point you obviously very little decline this quarter only 25 basis points given the outsourcing going on new products coming in ICOS coming in how do you see the gross margin line trending in this environment?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well I think the way to combine it I guess internally I think I am we are very happy with the speed and the progress we've made on the programs that we have and also our new product introductions some of which haven't actually announced. But we're shifting that data system right now. So we think the plus point is definitely coming down again a lot of that doesn't show up in the P&L for a while. We're happy with the backlog and the profitability of the backlog at this point. So I think that will bode well over the next couple of quarters. I think you hit upon the one thing that's little bit more difficult to predict and that's the acquisitions and how quickly we can lack of a better word integrate and do some things process wise and to help the profile. And as we talked about last time we were all together. We think that will take two to three quarters in general and obviously with ICOS have a great team and we've started those plants to make such improve the gross margin. And as we do other acquisitions again I think that's the hardest part of the project but we have plans improving and get them up the KT kind of standards in two to three quarters. So that helps.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, that helps thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Deep Calick [ph] with Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi thanks for taking my question can you give the shipments for the June quarter?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes Deep [ph] they were about 545.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay and then a follow up on the Vistec [ph] acquisition. How should we think about the margins on these products, are they similar to reticulate inspection products or are similar to inspection products?
Unidentified Company Representative: I think it's too early for us to say. As you know we just entered a term sheet with them and we have to go through regulatory. But we can say as we like their market position and we believe that it will help us build the franchise, but we are... it's preliminary for us to talk about margins.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi guys. John, can you give us some sense of what you think you'll ship in September? And then I have a follow-up.
John Kispert: Sure, Tim. The ship plan is moving around right now. I would say it's anywhere, unfortunately anywhere from $500 million to $450 million. Today it's closer to $500 million but given this as a conference call I mean there is probably given it for September quarter also things that can change quickly. So I give a wide range here. $450 million to $500 million.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. So let's just take out mid-point of that range. So at that shipment level you'll have about total when you take your revenue backlog and your shipment backlog you have a 5.8 months which is on the very low end of what you had the last 3, 4, 5 years. So that would imply that unless bookings come back pretty significantly in December. That you wouldn't be able to ship a whole lot more, in fact may be a little bit less in December to actually build back up some backlog. Is that the right way to think about it?
John Kispert: Yes I would... I think generally let me give you a couple more things to put into the... into your algorithm as you are thinking about it. Two very important things. One is if you are looking at it over a period of time, the thing that I'd remind you is that service is not in 12 months of backlog. And you we are up about 40% or 50% over the last two years in service. And so it's a much bigger part of the total equation. So when I look at the months of backlog now I feel very good about it, I think the second piece as when we talked about in the past and just given that transition industry is going through right now. We have quite bit of inventory from data shipments that are out there right now. That we don't count as obviously accounts orders because we are working with the... on the leading edge 32 nanometer, 45 nanometer kind of R&D projects as those orders come in. We'll count them order shipments and revenue almost at the same time, and that's larger number than historically at least over last two years. So add those two extra pieces to it we feel much, we feel very good about the backlog. The other thing I would remind to everybody when it comes to backlog is the industry as Tim knows and most of you know that industry has changed quite a bit on this point over the last two or three years and in the wee times now have to be in that two to three months timeframe. So we have to be on turn quickly to take care of our customers so we're balancing that in that months of backlog. And so we feel relatively good about the next two quarters in revenue and kind of keeping in that pace that we just gave you in the guidance at.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay, John thanks
John Kispert: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of C. J. Muse with Lehman Brothers.
C.J. Muse: Yeah good afternoon thank you for taking my question. I guess I was helping you could talk a little bit on ICOS and then what we should think about in terms of revenue contribution in the second-half of the calendar year as well as the impact on gross margins?
John Kispert: No, my view is to be helpful as I can but we decided not to get set the precedent of breaking out any of our businesses like we have done for the last 15, 20 years. We group one month of it obviously the month of June and that was about $9 million of revenue. Going forward if the backend is obviously, you guys know not strong as it usually is right now. The business is dilutive to our model, the basically a breakeven business over the next quarter. But that does have a bunch what I will call an integration or bubble cost as we work with the senior management team there and kind of source things out between the two organizations. So we think that it will be very profitable over time but I feel over the next quarter or so probably less profitable than historically for ICOS.
C.J. Muse: Okay great and if I could sneak in a second question on the service front you talked about that being strong for the last few years. Could you put I guess some numbers around that from a growth perspective that you anticipate for calendar '08 and maybe an early read on calendar '09?
John Kispert: Yes. If you look at it over the last say ten years, it's been compounded growth rate at I think it's about 14% or 15%. We just shipped a lot of tools over the last two years that will come off warranty and will go on contract and so I think from what I can tell working with our customers they are all happy with the service KLA-Tencor provides constantly predictably at 300 millimeter with the challenges that they all have at 65 and 45 nanometer, I think our contract penetration will continue to be at the rate it has been. So I don't see any reason to see change from that kind that mid-teens growth rates in their service organization.
C.J. Muse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar: Hi thanks for my question just on the radical inspection looking at your booking in this segment as being down a little more than your systems bookings have been over the last couple of fiscal years it used to sort of growth to be a bigger portion of your business in a some years ago is there any reason to be worried about market share versus just some kind of a cycle in the radical inspection business as you think about?
Richard P. Wallace: Yes Satya its Rick I'll take that there's two things about radical what kind of good news or bad news so is bad news, bad news is the... is sort of spending right now and the reason they are not spending is because they built out the 45 nanometer capability the good news is we have done well in our share and we've seen strength in the new offerings that we have had since we have in WPI we are at in a product transition year so the 5XX product we've shifting for quite a while will transition over the next 12 months so we forecast the radical will pick up. When two things happen one with the mass shops turned back on and right now there subject to this slowdown as per analysis, anyone else in fact, in some respects they split down more than the second one has will have new products in the next 12 months to 18 months and we'll see a radical build up as a percent at the other business. The other factor when you look at it is on a percentage basis, as John has pointed out, services grown overtime so that would and we've added some businesses through acquisition.
Satya Kumar: Okay, that's helpful and then on foundry could I have follow up just some clarity on what's happening from a cyclical on a secular perspective foundry out of running pretty high in the first half the kind of the seasonal order strength. What do you see for the second half and from a longer term perspective, do you see some record at this morning and its staffing about taking down to the capital density circularly look at their capacity growth that actually. I think more wafer start capacity but less CapEx dollars in the last few years. How do I reconcile those comments versus capital intensity growing with technology transitions? How should I think about that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes well I think there's two things; one, is our value add is to help them increase their efficiency and overall to be able to leverage the equipment that they buy more effectively. And so we've seen foundries be a strong source of business especially as they try to juggle multiple product line and multiple design roles at the same time. So I think our foundry business has done reasonable well in that and we do see signs of additional starts happening and we see some good early indicators as we move forward. But I do think that there has been as you said the efficiencies clearly are playing out in the foundry space and our goal is to be part of the overall value add to that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi this is [indiscernible] on behalf of Jim Covello. Quick questions about the push outs that you talked about you've been seeing over the last couple of months are those primarily push outs associated with previous plans by your memory customers to extend capacity or are those actually related to some of the technologies in old showings [ph] that perhaps are being pushed out today. Then also I was just curious what you are baking into your September order guidance in terms of memory orders that you are expecting in September? Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure Kate [ph]. Couple of things; one is push outs that we've seen are primarily associated with the capacity portions, we still see technology buys and it is just generally as John indicated we are seeing very conservative spend and bringing on new capacity from our customer base. So it's not anything in particular. In terms of memory we talked about memory being, overall we look forward to September and we think probably overall at around 55% after memory.
Unidentified Analyst: 55% of orders you expect to be memory orders?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes.
John Kispert: Hi, Kate it's John Kispert. So 55% right now in our guidance for the September ending quarter I will say that's very fluid number particularly around I think the essence of your question which is really the kind of new fabric because I see kind of ads its sliding around between the December ending quarter and the September ending quarter and our best shot right now is probably 55% of the guidance we just gave you for the September quarter would be in the memory space and but we will see how it plays out.
Unidentified Company Representative: And again Kate that's of the orders that are segmented in the memory line foundry in logic because we serve another 24% of our business that cap tie that space.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And just a quick housekeeping question you mentioned OpEx going up as a result of ICOS could you maybe talk about how that breaks out between R&D and SG&A. How we should think about, where we should expect the increase to come from?
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure Kate, it's kind of 50-50, 50% and it's... I would tell you folks to kind of think of it in the range of $12 million to $15 million in total you can break them in half somewhere in that range and I would expect it to be close to the $12 million over some period of time then the $15 million.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay that's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mahi Sanganeria with RBC Capital Market.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Thank you. Can you give us a break up on the acquisition related charges, which one, how much is the amortization of intangibles and how much are one-time and what should be model for the September quarter in terms of amortization of intangibles?
Unidentified Company Representative: So the let's see the amortization of the intangibles this last quarter I don't have that in front of me it's roughly $8 million I think it was $7.8 million. The one-time for ICOS this quarter was about $36 million, $35.9 million if I remember right and obviously some of that... the prior acquisitions that will probably pop up with not only ICOS but with Vistec [ph] it is one that deal gets done. That helps?
Mahesh Sanganeria: Are you including that in the guidance for the September quarter?
Unidentified Company Representative: No I am not.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Was this amortization excluded?
Unidentified Company Representative: Amortization... what we have to do is in this last income statement we're talking about is $7.8 million and all I am trying to say is if it probably goes up a little bit overtime.
Mahesh Sanganeria: Okay, thank you
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.
Gary Hsueh: Hi, guys thanks for taking my question. Just longer term here looks like the real story in terms of growth in your service business, that business is up roughly 17% year-over-year, your semi business, your product business is down 26, so I think if that's more sustainable kind of growth trajectory for you over the next year or two, independent of the cycle, I was just wondering for fiscal '09 I think this question was asked but what are your expectations for after wood [ph] kind of dollar value per quarter in terms of your service run-rate with tools actually coming up R&D which are forecast that for '09?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, Gary, I think you have got some math wrong and I asked the question, I am not sure the question is what is the '09 plan for service?
Gary Hsueh: Yes, that's the first question, yes.
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay, I am not going to give that out.
Gary Hsueh: Okay.
Unidentified Company Representative: We don't break out our plans over the next year--
Gary Hsueh: Okay, but assuming that growth and knowing that the service business in terms of cost is fully loaded in the corporate sales number. I mean what's the disparity today between your service and your product business? And moving forward where do you see more wood to chop is it in your products business or in your service business? And if it is in your service business how do you go about doing that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Let me just back up and say... you said something about our product business being down 26% year-on-year. And I guess I don't know how you can come up with that.
Gary Hsueh: Just looking at the June quarter. Yes, the products business is down 26% and the service business is up 17% year-over-year.
Unidentified Company Representative: From June to June?
Gary Hsueh: Yes and for the fiscal year, product is down 12% and services is still up 16%, that's--
Unidentified Company Representative: Okay I mean its... so is the rest of the industry. But I guess my point is it's far better than the rest of the industry.
Unidentified Company Representative: As far as how we manage service in the rest of the divisions of the 40 different products that we have in gross margin. It's all very similar I mean it comes down to efficiency of training of folks, of engineers, not only in R&D but also in the field and we're going to stay focused on that across our entire stall base. We've talked many times about e-diagnostics we've talked many times about making it much more efficient from peoples' perspective. The other big piece obviously with each generation is the part side of the business which the cost of parts keep going up, the complexity keeps going up. So how we support our customers with the right parts, at the right place, at the right time has become a bigger and bigger part of business. I think we're doing very well at it. The efficiency in our service business has improved mildly. It helps the productivity of the service business but so as our manufacturing organizations and the gross margin also and I will say that probably improving at the same rate over the last couple of years.
Gary Hsueh: Okay, thank you. John I guess in the last quarter you talked about service increasing as a percentage of sales and with some gross margin issues coming about because of naturally lower gross margins and service and you are talking about the need to kind of decent more work there I am just trying to follow-up on that comment from last quarter.
Unidentified Company Representative: Do more work we are very happy with the progress of service organization is making, it's the profitability is what it is and I think that's you can see that in the profitability of entire business in what we just talked. It's all in gross margin we're pretty happy with the gross margins of the company particularly displaying the cycle. So I miss in Gary what you want me try to predict what's the profitability of services over the next year or so--
Gary Hsueh: Yes, I just trying to figure out what the... how much you can gleam in terms of incremental gross margin from higher digit in your service business that's all.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, I wouldn't go and predict much improvement there I mean we're going to work like have to keep up the needs of our customers and its an newly business that is forever more and more challenging that we're very happy with the profitability on and it's a balancing act continuously.
Gary Hsueh: Okay, great thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from the line [indiscernible] with JPMorgan.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon a quick question you mentioned some of your projects are getting pushed out to the end of the calendar year does that mean we could maybe and perhaps model it turning orders in that at the end in the calendar fourth quarter or shipments or I just kind of wanted to get some more clarity on that.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes, what we said it's Rick clearly we see September historically has been down and it's really tough to predict whether December is up off of that, but when we look out we do see more projects happening in the December time frame than what we see in September. But as you know, visibility is very tough in this environment. So I'd see it's early and if you look at overall capacity for the industry, September is certainly pretty low number relative to historical numbers. So from that standpoint we are anticipating some improvement beyond September but we are running business, as John said we are doing everything prudently to run the business, maintain backlog and kind of work through this cycle and come out stronger than ever as we look to the other side, but it's very early to call the December
Unidentified Analyst: Okay great thank you.
Operator: Our next quarter is from the line of Bill Ong with American Technology.
Bill Ong: Hi I think you mentioned memory orders and represent about 19% of booking mix is that correct?
John Kispert: Give me a second here Bill. I think I said memory DRAM was about... yes 19% with NAND and DRAM.
Bill Ong: Okay. That is a pretty big drop because in absolute dollars that means its about 68% quarter-to-quarter sequential drop? And looks like logic went up in the quarter can you offer little bit color on what's the dynamics financing and what is happening in logic. I know why memory is down but it seems like it's down very severely.
John Kispert: Yes I think the memory as you know the industry is kind of recharging on memory logic we continue to see the investment for the 45 nanometer node and some work now on 32 and that is really been driving that segment for us and we are very happy with our performance there.
Bill Ong: That means with $90 million in bookings and memory, you pretty much bottoming out now this doesn't seem like a whole lot down slide with memory over the next quarter?
John Kispert: I think you're right Bill, there is not a lot of orders in there.
Bill Ong: Okay thank you
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Chris Ancorn [ph] with the Banc of Americas Securities.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions. In terms of memory you guys are seeing 55% of your September orders would be for memory so that's a pretty big jump in terms of dollars from June to September how do you see that actually trending into December if you can just give some directionality?
Richard P. Wallace: So I think if you look out and you did math Chris, you realize it's still not back even to the March level. So it is up but as we just pointed out it's not a pretty good number. December, it goes back to what you believe about forecast and the projects that are out there and right now that's -- it's very early to predict what December is going to look like although it's John's point of previous comment. It's certainly... things are pretty soft right now. So when we look out there it is not a reasonable thing we would see improvement after September and memory is definitely part of that.
Unidentified Analyst: I think the same to think about with DRAM right now for us, it certainly feels like stabilized and as the prior caller mentioned at very low levels when I think stabilize, I am talking about pricing but also we know that we are in the part of the year. Seasonally where pricing often becomes a little bit softer. So we are taking a conservative view on in our guidance and what we are talking to you about as far as what we think will land in the September quarter as far as orders are concerned. And when you added all up at that low level it does look to be anywhere from 45% to 55% of the total order in September. And there is increase some our sales bundles a bunch higher amount its actually sitting in the December quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, is this assume the scenario will foundry to because you said, CapEx on the first half of the year so obviously a foundry orders are going down in September. Is there any reason to think it's actually going to pick back in December.
John Kispert: Sure there is pretty of reasons to think it will pick up. If you look kind of customer by customer again it's hard to predict in this environment when they let the orders go we have a very I think prudent number in their for the September quarter which as you said is down, right now our customers would tell us it's higher in the December quarter. But we'll see how things go with the economy through the next three or four months, and how they decide to run their businesses. I think with the foundries the thing you need to think about and watch is the is utilizations. I mean utilizations in total for the foundries is relatively good, what's the leading edge?
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
John Kispert: We'll get orders.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay just last question, were there any cancellation and What's your share count assumption for September
John Kispert: We did booked about 15 million across six different customers we booked about of $100 million over the last couple of quarters four quarters. So we think the backlogs in pretty good shape and the share count for the quarter I think was 178 million
Unidentified Analyst: Share count assumption to September.
John Kispert: I think about of 175.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Kim [ph] with Deutsche bank
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question hey I was wondered if you could give us an idea about what the ICOS contribution was for the guidance in terms of revenue bookings and shipment and how much of it added to your backlog?
John Kispert: Were you listening to the earlier part of the call activity and all
Unidentified Analyst: No I didn't hear you give guidance I think you only mentioned shipment to total number. And also I didn't know you mentioned anything about the ICOS's contributions to backlog?
John Kispert: So it is a relatively small contribution. We only took a month of the... think of it as the P&L side we took the whole balance sheet into our business. I also think the way to think about is that the back end isn't as strong as it has been in prior quarters. But that's... we don't normally break out our backlog for folks.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay so, with regards to the how it was trending, I mean is it trending in line with like the semiconductor cycle right now with the kind of similar to your front end business or is it slower decline? Could you kind of characterize that?
John Kispert: Yes more similar, I think overall some of the back end has been down as well. So it's similar to what we are seeing.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Ben Pang with Caris & Company.
Benedict Pang: Thanks for taking my question. One question if you look up to the second half of the year, do you expect that your orders for less than 45 nanometer go up and can you put some color on that. How many customers may be there are that you have ordering type of equipment thank you.
John Kispert: Sure Ben, the 45-nanometer was about 75% of the business that we did in the June quarter just finished. And that seems about the right rate as you go forward. I think the question is these are pilot investments and what we're hoping to see is obviously the expansion into more manufacturing and more ramp up, so. We anticipate that as a percentage we probably won't see a lot of difference but we obviously we are hoping for the volumes to pick up for the end of the year.
Benedict Pang: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin: My question is about the ICOS acquisition all seen it neither its integrated to the company does your plans in place to do manufacturing of their products over to Singapore and moment that the and how much could that help gross margins at some point?
John Kispert: Hey Steven John Kispert we don't have any plans to make any changes at this point we're working closely with managing the team at ICOS so I would say its very premature even to think about the things that you're talking about in your question.
Stephen Chin: Thanks, thanks John.
John Kispert: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel Nicolaus.
Patrick Ho: Hey thanks a lot. As you shift to the outsourcing in Singapore how quickly can you I guess react if there's a snap back in demand of request for shipments?
Richard P. Wallace: That of course is the key to our business we feel very good right now, about at this level been able to quickly when I say quickly over two three quarters be able to double the size of our output. Our cycle time as I said in the prepared remarks are down the newer products are coming out with common platforms and much lower cycle times. Singapore plant is doing outstanding. So that is not one of my big concerns, I think we are react very quickly to any sort of pick up anywhere in the world.
Patrick Ho: Okay, great thank you very much.
Richard P. Wallace: Yes.
Operator: Our next question is a follow up from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi guys again, John, I am not super bearish memory but I guess the big argument to kind of make memory better over the longer term, is that the orders comedown and that kind of stay down for at least couple quarters. So I am just looking at the increase in September it's about tripling probably at low level in June, but is that increase pretty broad based or is that being driven by one particular standard.
John Kispert: Yes, I would think of that as being one maybe one and half large orders.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then just kind of bigger picture question relative to 45 nanometer, the leverage in the story really that kind of didn't come out an opportunity at 45 versus 65 has been a big part of the story and I guess as I am looking at the order mix, you kind of already it seems like 75% of the way through the mix shift. Now so is the 45 nanometer story would you argue that kind of leverage that you get? Incrementally versus 65 is that kind of over now and so you are already looking forward to 32 incrementally?
Richard P. Wallace: No. unfortunately we are not seeing much of these 45 production we are seeing 45 development in pilot lines. So we are getting early validation and you know in this kind of environment the reason we hold up relatively well is because we get a lot of technology buyers. And we get technology buyers and that's what's going on right now but they are not people aren't scaling production. And so we'd expect to see the ramp up of 45 play out in the models that we've discussed in terms of incremental opportunities.
Timothy Arcuri: And Rick, just to make sure you said that the incremental opportunity at 32 relative 45 is 30% and is that the same number as 45 relative to 65?
Richard P. Wallace: Right.
Timothy Arcuri: Okay thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Gavin Duffy with Broadpoint Capital
Gavin Duffy: Yes thanks guys. I was just wondering you talk about booking $15 million in the quarter and then you got his $750 million ship backlog and I'm just saying do you... were pretty comfortable with that number that's spread enough?
John Kispert: That is good great question. We're watching it very closely and I think the point I was trying to make was we've been watching it closely for last four quarters in other words we didn't just make this quarter and de-booked $15 million we've de-booked every quarter for the last four quarters and so we're still comfortable today with our backlog most of the deliveries are within the next six months. Couple of them have moved out to maybe seven or eight months but I feel very comfortable with it at this point of cycle with the backlog. If you look at our history every quarter we're de-booking so I am not giving you a number that all of sudden will drop on you. It's our very best estimate and we call it actually every two weeks in this environment and recheck with the customers. I think the other data point that you should think about with your question is the shipment number I gave that earlier also, the shipment quite a bit of it just in this quarter and also in the December quarter.
Gavin Duffy: Okay and now I would say I appreciate and I think if I can sneak one more here with business being down across all the product lines. We have to see some improvement is there one area you think that might improve for the others in terms of wafer radical metrology?
John Kispert: You know the... is the one to there is a gap historically many of the focus we know that it as Rick mentioned this earlier as we come out with newer products particularly in the radical space and in the wafer space you might see those places pick up first because obviously that those are the you need radicals stinging their wafers to ramp those are typically the first jumps that would see. But in this case I think some of the prior questions we have a bunch of capacity like opportunities for large companies that taking the advantage of the environment the economic environment connected to jump on people with some other with newer fabs and in the case of memory, to Tim's question, they try to move quickly from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter. They try to get below 6X technology you know as why because they want to lower their cost and drive profits So I think in this case you might see a pop sometimes in the end of the calendar year driven lesser brand technology more about just somebody trying to change the basis of their business.
Gavin Duffy: Thank you very much.
John Kispert: Yes.

Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Q3 was a period of solid execution for KLA-Tencor in a tough overall market environment. Despite our persistent weakness in the global semiconductor equipment market, we met or exceeded each of our financial targets for the period and took a significant step to expand our potential market opportunity through the pending acquisition of ICOS Vision Systems. We also delivered stronger operating performance than the comparable revenue levels in the past. A relatively strong performance in this very challenging demand environment reflects the continued strength of our market leadership, the superior value we deliver to our customers in helping them meet their yield demand and continued great execution by the KLA-Tencor team. Revenue in the March quarter was $602 million, above the range of our guidance for the quarter. Net income, excluding some one-time charges, was also above the range of guidance at $121 million or $0.67 per diluted share. And we generated approximately $148 million in cash flow from operations in the period. Orders for the March quarter were $554 million, down approximately 4% from Q2 and above the midpoint of the range of our guidance for the period. I would now like to provide some more perspective on the current demand environment. In general, the weak demand climate that began late in 2007 has not improved to any significant degree in the first calendar quarter of 2008. And although there are some pockets of strength among our larger customers, as they ramp investment in 45 nanometer, current indications are that weak overall demand environment will continue to persist into the second half of 2008. I'll now provide some perspective on the current bookings environment in our various customer segments. Memory was once again our largest customer segment during the March quarter. Memory customers today are investing in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller design rules and higher density application as well as reduced costs. In turn, driving increased adoption of process control to reduce defectivity. In March, we saw strong brightfield adoption among memory customers investing in 45-nanometer development. Foundry demand improved in March. Historically, foundry customers have been heavy adopters of process control, given the nature of their business. Unique to foundries is the challenge of managing an ever increasing number of products and processes, while at the same time continuing to reduce their time to market. These conditions make achieving targeted yields in a shorter period of time critical to success in this segment. Project orders in the March quarter affected bookings for advanced development pilot lines. Investing in leading edge technologies continues to be a major driver of demand in the Logic segment. To summarize, although our customers remain cautious with their capital investment, the increased complexity from advanced technologies is creating new yields and defectivity challenges, driving the need for advanced inspection in measurement technology and accelerating adoption of process control. As a result, even in a period of slowing overall wafer manufacturing equipment demand, we expect process controls to continue to outperform the industry on the order of 5% or more in 2008. Now, I would like to discuss some recent highlights for KLA-Tencor on our four strategic objectives; customer focus, growth, operational excellence, and talent development. Customer focus is the first of our four strategic objectives at KLA-Tencor. We work hard to understand our customers' requirements and to provide solutions in every market we serve. The keys to our success are to collaborate closely with our customers, innovate to develop creative, differentiated solutions to meet their inspection and measurement needs, and then execute in bringing new products to market and supporting them throughout the product lifecycle. I am pleased to report that in the March quarter, we sustained our market leadership in each of the key markets and product lines that we serve. As always, a great deal of hard work which required to win the business made even more challenging in an environment when capital is tight, and I applaud our team's hard work and successful execution in this particularly difficult period. I'd like to share some key product and competitive highlights from the quarter. First, in defect inspection, where our customers are ramping their investments in development of 45-nanometer technology, we continue to maintain a leading market position. We had a strong quarter of brightfield adoption in March, placing 281x full spectrum brightfield tools at three different logic customers. The 281x features new optical modes that enable increased defect detection at twice the computing speed of earlier generation tools, while demonstrating superior sensitivity, capture of unique defect signatures and throughput. KLA-Tencor's full-spectrum DQV broadband technology is unparalleled in the marketplace in delivering increased sensitivity required to tune for TV effect in critical patterning layers at advanced technology nodes. In darkfield Inspection, we won orders to for our Puma 9150 platform for both DRAM and Flash customers. Our Puma 9150 delivers desired sensitivity at twice the throughput of competitive offerings. We expanded our market penetration and EB review marketing material. Our new eDR-5200 is a medium review solution that offers enhanced resolution, improving the productivity of the inspectors and providing connectivity to improve brightfield recipes, but also delivering high resolution and stage accuracy, allowing maximum capture of defects on the review system. The eDR-5200 provides a great solution and positions us for growth in this important market segment. In metrology, KLA-Tencor continues to be the market leader by offering a comprehensive suite of metrology products to give our customers the ability to maintain tight control of their process window. In the March quarter, our next generation overlay metrology platform was chosen through a record with logic customer, demonstrating significant performance improvement over our existing product line as well as providing important product extendibility. Moving on to reticle inspection; last week we introduced our latest mask inspection technology from Wafer Plane Inspection or WPI. Designed to serve the 32-nanometer mask node, WPI is a single system tool that provides the versatility to find all defects on a mask and show the defects that will print in an actual device wafer. WPI also operates up to 40% faster than previous inspection systems, reducing defect inspection cycle times and reducing cost of ownership for our customers. The ability to accurately define printable defects on the inspection systems means that this is the first direct link between defect inspection and printability, a major innovation over traditional techniques which require multiple inspection systems or print check methods. There has been extensive field testing of this revolutionary technology to support 32 nanometer process development. These are just a few examples of recent successes we achieved during the March quarter in solving our customers' mission critical production challenges and expanding our market leadership. Across the industry, the technical challenges our customers are facing are significant, and we are working closely with them to solve those problems. Looking forward, our strong product pipeline and high level of R&D investment positions us well to meet our customers' next-generation inspection and measurement needs. In these periods of contraction and capital spending, we've leveraged our strong financial resources, technology expertise, and solid customer relationships to step up our investment in innovation anticipating our customers' requirements, so that when the demand climate improves again, we will be in a stronger position than ever. Our second strategic objective at KLA-Tencor is growth. Our goal is to continue to outgrow the industry and our growth prospects continue to look good. Even in this challenging CapEx environment, based upon the level of investment by customers in each of our market segments in driving forward their advanced technology roadmap and the increase in need for inspection measurement, as device makers address the greater complexity of their yield challenges in advanced design rules. We estimate the increased adoption of process control by chip makers at 45 nanometers translates to an incremental revenue opportunity for KLA-Tencor of 30% or more as compared with the 65-nanometer node. We look to compliment our core market growth through strategic acquisitions in adjacent markets. We have a disciplined approach to M&A, we are very selective about the growth prospects that we pursue with the strategy. We will only enter markets that feature prospects of profitable growth comparable to our own and where we can differentiate and add value. In February, we announced the intent to acquire ICOS Vision Systems, a leading supplier of packaging and interconnect inspection solutions for the semiconductor industry. ICOS Systems also performs inspection of solar wafers and solar cells, enabling solar manufacturers to effectively monitor the production process of different stages of production. The ICOS transaction would fit our acquisition criteria very well, setting the stage for additional growth and diversification outside our core inspection and metrology markets. We are currently in the tender offer phase of this transaction and if it is successful, we expect it to close in the current quarter and be accretive to EPS within the first year. In addition to the new markets that we have entered over the past 18 months, we have more growth initiatives in place at KLA-Tencor, and we will be providing update as they materialize. Our strategy will be to continue our organic effort, as well as leveraging our ability to successfully use acquisitions as a way to enter new markets. Our third strategic objective at KLA-Tencor is operational excellence. In June of 2006, we laid out plans to improve efficiencies in our business model and deliver operational excellence throughout the company. At the core of our operational excellence efforts is a company wide effort to leverage what was already a very good business model in our industry and drive operational improvements throughout our cost structure, optimizing our business model through better management efficiency, reducing the number of common engineering platforms and leveraging globalization of our workforce with the ultimate result being sustainable, higher margin performance and significant scale advantage at higher revenue levels. John will go through some of the details of these results in his prepared remarks. But the bottom line is that these actions have helped us achieve a higher level of profitability in our business than we delivered at comparable revenue levels in the past. Our fourth objective at KLA-Tencor is talent development. None of the success that KLA-Tencor enjoys would be possible without our world class workforce. While historically, we have developed world class talent and achieved outstanding financial results throughout the cycles of the industry, we are increasing our efforts in talent development as we know that our people are the key to our success. In summary, KLA-Tencor continues to be a company with an unparalleled portfolio of inspection measurement technologies and great people who are driven by unwavering passion for innovation and commitment to ensure our success. And we enjoy relationships with every major IC manufacturer. These attributes help to position KLA-Tencor to continue to outgrow the industry in 2008 and beyond. I would like to wrap up my comments now by giving you our guidance for the June quarter. Orders are expected to be down 5%, plus or minus 10% from the March quarter. Revenues are expected to be between $560 million and $580 million. And EPS in the range of $0.56 to $0.60 including stock-based compensation and excluding one-time charges. Now, I will turn the call over to John Kispert.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Rick. Once again, revenue for the quarter was $602 million, and fully diluted GAAP earnings per share was $0.61, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.67. The difference between the two EPS numbers are first, acquisition-related charges, which in this quarter were actually a net gain of $2.2 million, or $0.01 of EPS. This was caused by unrealized gains resulting from the euro call option contract related to the pending ICOS acquisition. Second, restructuring, severance and inventory-related charges of $13.5 million, or $0.07 per share, and finally, more option investigation charges of $5.2 million, or $0.03. This adds up to about $0.09 pre-tax or $0.06 after tax, again a difference between $0.67 per share and $0.61 per share. In our press release, you'll find a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, which covers the non-GAAP adjustments I just mentioned in far, far more detail. The reminder of my comments on the quarter will be focused on the non-GAAP results, which excludes the adjustments I just mentioned, but does include stock-based compensation. This is reflective of the financial performance of KLA-Tencor and how we run the business and enables a transparent comparison of results across periods and among peers. Operating results were driven by our expectation of orders received during the quarter, and we're managing the company according to our best estimate of the business environment over the coming quarters. For the March ending quarter, net bookings were $554 million, down 4% from the December ending quarter, and above the midpoint of our guidance of down 10%. At the end of the quarter, we initiated a $31 million de-booking. This was due to recurring delivery date changes by two customers and not due to a cancellation by either customer. We anticipate these orders will rebook sometime over the next six to nine months. Looking back over the last two quarters; new orders, that is gross value of orders before the previously mentioned adjustments were for the December ending quarter, of $602 million and new orders for the March ending quarter were $585 million. So, the new order environment and business level has changed a little for KLA-Tencor over the last six months. Customers are focusing on new technology development and pilot lines for next-generation production nodes, and our differentiating products play a significant role in that effort. The slowing demand environment we first began to experience late last year continues in each of these markets. Macroeconomic instability is adversely impacting demand for our customers' products and as a result, it's clearly affecting their capital investment decisions, both in size and in timing. While our business level appears to be stabilizing around current levels, visibility into meaningful growth inflection points continues to be very low. In total, we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion of backlog, which is approximately the same as last quarter. You can break this out as $795 million of shipment backlog or orders that have not yet shipped to customers and $416 million of revenue backlog, or products that have been shipped, but have not yet been signed off by customers and, thus, we have not taken revenue for them. Keep in mind that we do not include any service bookings or service revenues in any of our backlog numbers. The regional distribution of orders was the U.S. was approximately 22%, down from 28% from the December quarter. Europe was approximately 6%, down from 11%, Japan was approximately 29% and that's up from 22% last quarter, Korea is approximately 15%, down from 20%. Taiwan is approximately 20% and that's up from 18% last quarter. And the rest of Asia was approximately 8% [ph], and that's up from 1% a quarter ago. Our new products continue to do well at 45-nanometer and below. The market segment distribution of orders did not change significantly from last quarter. The approximate distribution was wafer inspection at 43%, reticle inspection was 11%, metrology was 22%, service was 23%, and other markets including LEDs, storage, and some solar was 2%. 45-nanometer and below investment continue to be a compelling customer spending trend for us, and those orders made up 53% of the orders received in the quarter. Looking at our income statement, operational execution was solid in the March quarter. As I said earlier, revenue was $602 million, slightly above our guidance range of $575 million to $595 million. This level is down 5.3% quarter-to-quarter and down 16% from the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.9%. We continue to focus on the productivity and efficiency of our manufacturing and service organizations as we ramp new products globally and improve our service delivery and spare parts distribution in the face of lower shipment volume. In our current fiscal year, service revenue is expected to be about 20% of total revenues, up from approximately 16% two years ago. While the significant growth of our service business is becoming a dilutive mix factor in our overall gross margin percentage, our belief is that gross margin dollars of this business drops to the bottom line serves as a solid and predicable cash flow generator for the company. As we told you about 24 months ago when we laid our operational plan, the company remains committed to a number of key operational initiatives focused on operational flexibility and operating cash flow. In fact, over this period, we have increased our sustainable cash flow yield to find its operating cash flow as a percent of revenue by over 25%. We have done this while integrating four acquisitions, adding customer development support resources, investing heavily in channel development and infrastructure for adjacent markets outside of semiconductors, and transitioning major product lines offshore. We have successfully ramped our Singapore operation to ship our SP2 product line to ramp down portions of our U.S. operation. So, not only we are encouraged by the predictability and efficiency of our team there, we are meeting our customer commitments and seeing better than expected cost savings. Currently, our Singapore plant is only 20% of capacity and we have multiple products that are due to transition from the U.S. to Singapore over the next several quarters. The operation continues to yield a cost advantage to us, our customers and our shareholders. In addition, this facility along with the operations in the U.S. and in Israel provide a global footprint that enables us to focus more on continued outsourcing of non-core manufacturing activities in the supply chain worldwide. In terms of working capital management, we are continuing to focus on cycle times across our businesses. Across the company, we have improved over 30% over the last year in manufacturing and in long lead time material flexibility. These initiatives will provide us with a long-term operational flexibility that is required to respond quickly to changes in customer demand, both down, and believe it or not, soon enough up, while generating more operating cash flow in any scenario. In the June quarter, we expect gross margin to be slightly lower, due primarily to revenue mix, as we expect product revenue to decline $20 million to $30 million quarter-to-quarter and we expect service revenue to be up another 3% to 5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down $2 million quarter-to-quarter to $189 million. R&D was $94.8 million, up $1.8 million from the December ending quarter, as we continue to accelerate key research and development activities driving organic growth in our core businesses as well as in programs and recently acquired companies, and we have several new product introductions planned over the next two months. SG&A for the quarter was $94 million, down $3.7 million quarter-to-quarter. We continue to focus on the sales channel efficiency and elimination of acquisition redundancies. Over the last year, we have made significant progress in integrating acquisitions and streamlining our core business cost structure. In fact, since the June quarter of last year, SG&A per quarter is down $19 million. While we are pleased with this progress, we believe there is additional opportunity here and we expect to continue to focus on these areas over the next several quarters. Historically, downturns have been an opportunity to strengthen our leadership position as our backlog level and product differentiated business model enables us to sustain profitability, while continuing to invest in key product development programs and to enhance the many key customer collaborations we have going. [Technical difficulty]. As a result, we expect total non-GAAP fixed costs on the core businesses will be roughly $190 million over the next several quarters. Other income for the quarter was $24.2 million. We realized gains from the redemption of our investment portfolio to fund the cash requirements for our proposed acquisition of ICOS. In the June quarter, we expect other income to be approximately $10 million as we use cash to fund our proposed acquisition of ICOS if as expected; we get it closed in the June quarter. The tax rate was 31.8% in the quarter, higher than the 28% discussed in the last conference call, due to the reduction in tax exempt interest. So, incremental other income was almost fully offset by the higher tax expense. Non-GAAP net income was $121 million, or $0.67 per fully diluted share. This number includes share-based compensation expenses of $25.9 million. In the June quarter, we expect expenses for share-based compensation to be roughly flat, at about $26 million. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at roughly $1.3 billion, an increase of $17 million quarter-to-quarter. In the quarter, we have purchased approximately $180 million of stock and paid a dividend of $27 million. Cash from operations was $148 million in the quarter. Inventory decreased by $39 million to $444 million. The results of the quarter include $18.3 million of charges from the scrapping and disposing of service inventory, due to fundamental changes in our spare parts delivery model, primarily in two key areas. First, we have improved in service efficiency, particularly in the areas of diagnostic capability, service engineered training, and most importantly, the overall reliability of our products from our engineering teams. And second, our push over the last 24 months towards more commonality across our platforms and new products. These common platform initiatives, which are a key component of our operational plan, have enabled platform maturation, which has led to earlier product performance stabilization, requiring lower average parts usage versus what we have seen historically. We believe these improved areas in the service delivery model are sustainable and will enable us to support this growing business at lower inventory levels in the future. As a result, due to the nature of this event, we initiated a one-time action to scrap the now-not-needed spare parts from inventory. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at $573 million, down $5 million from the prior quarter. And net capital expenditures were a negative $5 million. Note that the brief proceeds from the sale of three of our buildings in San Jose offset capital acquisitions by approximately $10 million in the quarter. Depreciation was $15.8 million, so on a net basis including retirements, fixed assets decreased by $21 million quarter-over-quarter. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter at just under 181 million. For the June quarter, fully diluted shares are expected to be about 179 million. Headcount ended the quarter at 5,770 employees, essentially flat to the December ending quarter. And finally, as we commented earlier, we believe that our business appears to be stabilizing at roughly these levels. However, we continue to be in a period of very low visibility. As a result, like last quarter, we remain very cautious. Given this environment, we will continue to run the company in a way that will enable us to maintain key investments, while ensuring sustained profitability and cash flow. Our guidance for the upcoming quarter does not include the financial impact of our announced intent to acquire ICOS Vision Systems. With that, to reiterate Rick's guidance for the quarter, bookings are expected to be minus 5%, plus or minus 10%; revenue between $560 million and $580 million, EPS including share-based compensation, but excluding one-time charges, at $0.56 to $0.60. This concludes our remarks on the quarter, and I'll now turn the call back to Ed to begin the Q&A.
Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations: Operator, will you please poll the audience for questions? Question And Answer
Operator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jay Deahna. Your line is open, sir.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Okay. Can you hear me?
Ed Lockwood - Senior Director, Investor Relations: Jay, we can hear you fine.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Okay, can you address this issue that's come up recently about the competition in the mask inspection business. Obviously, it regards Applied Materials; and just kind of wondering do you see your market share at risk, is there a differential between the fab and the mask shop? If there is a viable threat, does it impact pricing across your entire line and to what extent for the overall company can you offset a little bit of pricing pressure with your offshoring in your Singapore operations? So that's on the mask side, if you could go into that in detail, I would appreciate it. It seems to be the core issue regarding your stock right now. And then secondly, do you see any threatening products on the brightfield side of the equation? Thank you.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Jay, thanks. This is Rick; I will take both of those. Let me start on the mask side. As you know, we've had a strong market position in mask for a number of years and we are always dealing with competition and that's why our market share tends to be in the 80% range. It certainly fluctuates over time in modest amounts based on where we are in the cycle and product cycles as well. But we feel pretty good about our mask position. And we just announced and introduced as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, our WPI. And we think that that capability, in addition to the things that we have been doing on our product roadmap in general, positions us well. There are different mask segments for wafer fab and for mask shop and they are both competitive and they are both... it's both, in both cases, you've got to prove your differential performance. And we have done a good job of doing that. So we don't really see that the mask situation is significantly different than it's... than in the past. We've always had competitive pressures and we tend to do pretty well in spite of that. It's an attractive market; it's a growing market, so we know that that's going to attract competition. With regards to the second question about brightfield, it's a similar story actually. Brightfield, because of the importance of it and the increased adoption of inspection metrology at advanced nodes, we definitely see a lot of interest from competitors in trying to get into the space, and they have for a number of years. But we believe that our broadband DQV technology is uniquely differentiated and when we go head-to-head with alternatives in the market, we tend to do very well. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we had a very strong quarter in our brightfield product line as we help our customers deal with their advanced designs rules. So overall, competition is always tough for us. We always work hard to win orders, but we feel pretty confident of our position now and going forward.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: And then a quick follow-up; to what extent is your order guidance for the June quarter impacted by that typical end of the fiscal year sales push phenomenon? And to what extent is it reflective of true demand in the market and how would that roll out into September? Do you view June as the bottom for orders for this thing or is it kind of a rolling second quarter, third quarter thing? How do you see that?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Hey, Jay, John Kispert. The guidance is our very best attempt to size what we think is out there and doesn't take into account any, any I guess forecasted pull-ins or push-outs for that matter. I can say that we have taken a conservative approach relative to what we see actually in the sales funnel over the next two quarters. But it's... we haven't forecasted in the bookings number or the revenue number, anything that would tie to stuff being pulled in. The second question, Jay, was --
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Well, do you see 2Q or 3Q as a... together as a rolling bottom or do you see one stronger than the other, just kind of give a sense --
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, I got it, I got it. Yes, I think going forward; the best we can see today is we are looking at numbers kind of mid 500s to high 500s across all of our businesses. And of course, timing of those orders and the subsequent revenue is always the hard part in times like this. But I think if you think about modeling it through the second half of the year, that's what we see. I know conventional wisdom would say that there is a pick up somewhere in the second half of the year, and I can't... I wouldn't say that we are discounting that. But we will wait to see it before we start to rev up production and start shipping more.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Yes. One last real quick one. If you are going to experience a 30% increase in your revenue for fab opportunity at 45-nanometers versus 65, blended between logic and memory, when would you start to see out performance in your orders relative to the industry? I mean, is that happening now relative to this opportunity or when we see a concerted upswing in capacity expansion, are you going to see your orders shoot out faster than the industry?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, it's the last part... you answered the question yourself, Jay, it was the last part. When they start going to more capacity like buys, kind of pilot line into capacity is historically when we'll see the adoption shoot up. Right now, what we're shipping clearly is early pilot stuff and R&D, which are more a one system per fab, per mask shop, per R&D project.
Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh. Your line is open, sir.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. John, just on the back of Jay's last question, just looking at orders and the potential sort of bottom here in the back half, if I just sort of flat line your midpoint of your order guidance in the June quarter, all the way out to September and December; for the full year, your orders would only really be down 10%, but yet, everybody is claiming that CapEx is down 20. I understand that basically KLA will outperform given inspection metrology and its importance on the next kind of technology node. But a 5% difference would still argue for a little bit more downside. Are you just getting a little bit more visibility here in the back half and maybe getting some visibility on booking 09 CapEx in the back half? Can you shed any light there?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: I understand the question, Gary. It's tough to say right now. And the reason it's tough is our customers are certainly confused themselves as far as what they want to do in the second half of the year, or even this quarter. So, there is lots of things moving around. Best we can tell is, people are focused more in the latter half of '08... calendar year 08 and that is as of today. We've been doing this too long to go and hang our hat on that. Things could either get pulled in or pushed out from there. I wouldn't say we have much more visibility than most folks. We tend to have some of our higher end products will be longer lead time, which gives us a little bit more visibility. But I've got to tell you, one of the big changes in the industry over the last couple of years is the lead times as we try to help our customers more and more in their profitability and helping their flexibility, the lead times have come way down. So, to the extent we used to enjoy longer, a better visibility in times like this, it's really not there as much now as we really have shortened our cycle times and have put ourselves in a position to deliver quicker to our customers.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. My next question is just on gross margin, you talked about the product mix and increasing a bit about service sort of negatively impacting gross margin. Other peers have talked about a consolidating base of buyers, particularly in this downturn. And they've spoken about pricing pressure. Are you seeing any pricing pressure and what exactly are you doing here on the cost side to sort of offset any kind of pricing pressures that you do see?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Gary, we've been seeing pricing pressure since I've been in the company, that's 13 years; Rick, 19 years, 20 years?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: 20 years.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, 20 years, every quarter. What we're really focused on in times like this with our customers, have been for probably over a year now, is you'll see a lot more loaner tools out from KLA-Tencor, a lot more consignment tools. We'll extend warranties, all these are cost of ownership benefits to our customer. We are doing a lot more extra support; ramp support, move support, application support. That doesn't have to get paid for today, but can be pushed out over time. We are... we've not cut at all in any of our applications support, so we've really pushed a lot more advantages to our customers. And pricing, of course, we are seeing pricing pressure, and we are doing our best we can to help our customers with that, because they are clearly under profit constraints. But I wouldn't say it's any different than any other time over the last 10, 15 years.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes. And one thing we do, Gary, in times like this, as John mentioned consignment. You have to understand, sometimes that just means that we'll have capability on a tool, or we'll provide a tool with a little less capability with the option to upgrade it later, so allowing people to get in at a lower price point early on, but then have the extendibility in the platform to take them later. And I think that's an important offering for our customers when they are really constrained on their capital, but they want our technology.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Got you. And one last housekeeping question, I don't think you broke out your orders by memory, foundry, and logic, iDM bucket. Could you do that?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: By percentage?
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Yes.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, it's kind of interesting, and it was kind of a quarter, a quarter, a quarter and a quarter. Quarter, logic was about 25%; foundry, 25%; DRAM, 25%; and NAND, about 25%.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. So you did see a pretty nice pop in foundries. Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri. Your line is open, sir.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi guys, several things. First of all; John, can you give us what the shipment number was for margin? Tell us what you are planning on shipping for June?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, I know the June number better, Tim. What I am thinking is somewhere between 550 and 575 for June. And the reason for the range, obviously, is begin the back half of the quarter, some larger shipments, so we are sitting right on the cusp. So, I think it's somewhere in that range. And I am looking for a shipment number this last quarter was 582.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: 582, okay. And then John, did you say in answering a prior question, you were talking about kind of a trough run rate in the mid to high $500 million. Were you talking about orders or were you talking about revenues?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: I was kind of talking about both.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Both.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay. So don't you see the business getting materially worse from here from a bookings point of view?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Not today.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, and then I guess, can you also John, can you update what your new financial model might look like? I mean, I know there is a lot of different moving parts, but do you have any sense of... you kind of gave this model last SEMICON, so do you have any sense of kind of how that model would look now and particularly, say, at the same revenue level that you peaked out at during this last cycle, would your margins once they get back to that point, given the new state of the company, would the margins be better than that now?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: You know, we're going to spend a lot more time on this at SEMICON, and I think we have an analyst day coming up in I don't know, about a month; I will spend a lot more time on it for everybody. But we are ahead of plan. As you guys all remember, we said that this wasn't a big bang plan. We are going to work on it over a two to three-year period. We are ahead of all the plans we've put in place. So, I am not concerned that at any level of revenue that we won't outperform where we have been in the past. I think we are in pretty good shape there.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay. So John, just to be clear on that. So, I think you said maybe six months ago, you said like at the $625 million level that you were talking about kind of mid-59 gross margin. Is that still intact, you don't think you are actually better than that now?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: I think that's about right. And the tough part about getting on the 625 is what's the mix there and particularly around service, so when does it happen? But we're probably at that or if not, a little bit better.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Great. All right. Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harlan Sur. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon, and great job on the quarterly execution. We continue to hear about customers especially in memory sort of struggling with yield issues as they make their current technology transition. So, I guess my question is where are the major pressure points as it relates to yield; is it lithography, is it the use of new materials, is it etch? What are your customers telling you and how much of this is contributing to your book of business now versus next-gen tool buys?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Harlan, great question. Absolutely, memory and you hit on the main things that are happening. I think what happens in the last six to nine months is as the memory guys shrink what they found was the fleet of tools they had, mostly our tools, inspection and measurement, were not finding the later defects that they had to find, the smaller ones as they shrank in design rules. So, they fixed some of the big problems. But then they got into two things; one is the defects, just the size themself and then the signatures and this kind of goes to a theme we will talk about more in the future of the systematic defects became a larger percent of what they are trying to find. And you really need higher resolution to do that. And it does happen around lithography, both immersion lithography, but just advanced lithography in general. But also certainly when new materials come in and even new device structures. So, certainly, it was a part of the business, and we talked about success we had in the March quarter, serving the memory market with our brightfield tool. And those kind of universal across our memory customers is a realization that they needed that advanced capability just to see what was going on in their process to make improvements. So, I think a lot of them felt that they were not reaching their yield entitlement, and that's why our thesis is there'll be a higher percent of their capital will be spent on inspection metrology, just to make sure they are getting leverage out of the capital that they've purchased for their process.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you for that. And then on the reticle inspection side, what's... maybe share with us the early feedback on your new TeraFab tools as customers start to ease out work. And I think at a high level, is it fair to assume that your reticle inspection business will go inline with their overall business looking out over the next couple of years?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, great question. It is... to start with the WPI, I think the number one thing we are seeing in the reticle right now, and I just was meeting with some customers this week to talk about this, is just really desire to get the capability in their hands faster. And so part of the challenge that we've got is how do we deliver and deploy the advanced technology we've got like WPI. Because it's not just hardware, it's also the application support for that. So we're having that discussion with a lot of customers around the world, and how do we deploy. We do think there is a big opportunity. One of the things that's happening, of course, is as we push lithography it's putting more strain on the reticles which drives the need for inspection metrology. And with the EUV looking like it's being pushed out further and further, a lot of people as they're facing some of the additional challenges coming up are looking to the reticle strategy to help bridge the gap. So, we are seeing increased interest in the current generation of products we have and also a lot of discussions about our roadmap, and how can we get more capability to them sooner.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: All right, thank you.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Harlan
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello. Your line is open, sir.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks so much. Good afternoon, guys. First, quick housekeeping, I might have missed it, but did you give the shipments for this quarter?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Sure did, Jim, I can't remember what I said, 582.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: 582. Okay, thank you. And my real question is your last cycle was obviously driven by memory. We hadn't seen anything like that in ten years, and there is some argument that we wouldn't see anything like that in 10 years again. So, working under the assumption that memory as a percentage is going to kind of normalize downward, I would think that that's a good thing for KLA. Can you talk about that a little bit, your penetration in memory versus the other areas of the market? Obviously, you have a lot business in memory, but on a relative basis, what that means from margins and what that means about your ability to potentially outperform in the next cycle, which would presumably not be as dominated by memory as the last one was?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Jim, yes, you are right in that... this is the way memory built it, the level of repetition to the production line. As you get 30, 40, 50, 60, 70,000 wafer starts a month, you don't need as much inspection and measurement. At least that's what our customers try to do. And that is certainly not the case in the microprocessor logic or in foundry world. Now, we worked hard over the last year to introduce new products after new problems, new issues on the memory side of the business. So, we think that we are fine, no matter what happens to be hitting as far as who is spending money. But clearly, in the years where the foundry side of business, the logic side of the business is having a better year or better quarter, a better half, it's usually better for KLA-Tencor just because of the level of complexity in quick turns and price per unit that's at play for our customers, because they want to spend more in this, what is essentially insurance for their yield.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, and just to build on John's point; I think one of the differences is the memory guys figured out that they really needed the inspection measurement to optimize and get their entitlement in yield, and that drove our business. I think a lot of the guys know when they push the design rule, it's enabling, so they've got to have the capability earlier and that drives more advanced tools. And I think the one thing we've seen is the 45-nanometer start, even 65 is not so prevalent in foundries right now and as those... the iDMs convert more of that, we think there is a big potential for more inspection metrology there.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: And I don't know... this is not an easy question. But do you guys have an idea or an opinion of what the sort of normalized breakdown between memory, foundry and logic is going to be. Obviously, it's not as memory intensive, but memory may be a little bit bigger a piece of the pie sort of five years out than it was five years ago, but obviously not as big as it's been in the last couple of years. What you guys think the normalized breakdown is?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: It's really hard to forecast that. I would say that it likely often tilts more to what it's been, with the one big exception to that being NAND is a new driver and has a kind of a new long-term potential. And we didn't really have that in the past as driving leading edge. So I think you are right, but the difference being there is just more application space that NAND can serve and so that's kind of, if you will, almost a fourth market, because DRAM is more tied, as you know, to the PC side.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Sure.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: But I do think that you know, and we are seeing it now some of the correction in the overbuild for memory is clearly what's being going on in the last couple of quarters.
James Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Well, thank you very, very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar. Your line is open.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Yes, hi thanks. Is your outlook for mid-500s to high 500s on April bookings that actually embeds an increase in bookings, I guess, from your seasonally slow September quarter. Just wanted to confirm if that includes or excludes any contributions from ICOS, what do you expect that to be in the second half?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Satya, I said in the prepared remarks, nothing we've talked about includes any impact from ICOS.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. Okay. Can you help me understand bottoms up what's sort of driving that sequential increase in the second half for you versus most of your peers looking at significant declines? Specifically, you mentioned that one of your... some of your larger memory customers are still very active and strong in the first half. What do you see in terms of linearity of orders in these large memory customers and also you seem to have a pretty good increase from the foundries here in the March quarter as in terms of the orders in the second half.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Satya, I am little bit confused, we haven't said anything about an increase in the second half.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: I'm looking at your June order guidance of 525ish, right?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: And so mid-500s to high-500s.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, well, all right. I see what you are doing; okay. It looks relatively flat to us out to the second half today, and we are putting some conservative windage in that just because we don't know what's going to happen in the second half of the year in all cases. But I wouldn't build in an up second half for KT right now under the environment we're operating in. When I said mid-500s to high-500s, I also... if you listen to the prepared remarks, pointed out that our gross new orders for the quarter were 580.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: So, if you put those two together, our midpoint and the 580 you end up with about a 550 number going into what's seasonally usually a soft period for us, which is the summer time.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: I am still a little confused; I think your guidance on this 525 for June, is that higher than --
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Well, it's a range as you --
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Because down 5% is off of your gross number, is that right?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: It's a net number and it's a range, plus or minus 10%.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. So we should be really thinking of the like 525 run rate in the back half of the year for bookings?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: I don't know what you want to think, Satya.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: I am just trying to figure out what you meant by that mid-500s to high 500s, because --
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: That's what I think our order range is going forward.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. And so... and you are saying that doesn't imply an increase in second half from June.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Not that I know of, no.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay, maybe I'll circle back with you offline. Just a bigger picture question, Rick. When I look at process control as a percentage of WFP over multiple years, I see that it's actually sort of stabilized around this 13% level. It used to grow quite a bit in the early 2000, and you mentioned that KLA can significantly outgrow process control. What were you saying going forward that's going to help process control increase as a percentage that wasn't there before?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, Satya, primarily 45-nanometer. I mean, what we are seeing now, the preliminary look at 45, and as John mentioned, we're really in the development phases of that in pilot production, but not large scale production of 45. It's pretty clear to us what our customers are telling is that there is just a lot more challenges they face, both that are related to defectivity and systematic defects, size of defects and also metrology. And so that's when we've modeled that and the early data supporting that there's going to be a larger percent of their spent as they ramp 45-nanometer, and that's what drives the out perform in terms of... relative to the rest of the space. And the early data looks pretty good on that, and as we move forward, I think we're fairly confident that that's how it's playing out.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria. Your line is open.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, thank you very much. I have a question on year-over-year deferred revenue and shipments. So, last year, your shipment was up 6% and the revenue was up 17%. This year, can you give us an idea whether the... since you are entering with a much lower deferred revenue, will the revenue growth will be inline with the shipment growth?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Mahesh, it's John Kispert. Difficult question to answer. We're just in April. It really is a function of how quickly our customers sign off on the shipments. We like to... we have in the past for many years run the business with essentially what we call five to six months of on-ship backlog. And that essentially means that we could with no orders shipped for another five to six months at the current rate. And then it's... and then we've run for a number of years with two to three months of deferred revenue; and that model really hasn't changed over the last couple of years. So, to the extent you are looking at modeling KLA-Tencor, I would stick with those assumptions, because that's just how we like to run the business and it really works well with our customers too, so I wouldn't deviate from that.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: The other thing I want to check is, it looks like your service revenue is increasing significantly. And if I take your 550 number and flat line that, it looks like your... and take your equipment, just the systems revenue down 20% and service down... up 10% that will give us the kind of revenue you are talking about. And I think that's what people are confused about that, everybody is talking about 20% to 25% kind of CapEx or 25% to 30% and you are not implying that and I think probably it's the service in growth that is helping you in the revenues. Is that a good way to look at it?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Certainly, service is... for really two fundamental reasons is doing well. One is the, what I would call, older installed base to create more cash flow for our customers, KLA-Tencor maintenance can certainly help with there and that's been a big shot in the arm in the service business. And the other one is just newer tool shipments, far more complex, far more connectivity, which helps with the growth of the service business. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the... it's... it dilutes our gross margin. It's not a... but the bottom line is about the same as the rest of our business. And so it's... it is growing nicely and does offer us a buffer in tougher times like right now when it's well over $100 million a quarter, it gives us kind of a lower bandwidth that we won't drop down too low because we have that annuity stream.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: It grew 24% last year. Can we going forward model on a steady state 5% to 10% growth, because last year I think you had couple of acquisitions on service side. 5% to 10%, is that a good way to model?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: I think you're very safe at 10%.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks a lot.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes.
Operator: Your next question is from Steven Pelayo. Your line is open, sir.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: John, just a quick question, the gross margin guidance for June. You suggested down, that's obviously... obvious on little revenues. But then you also talked about mix impact as service moves kind of 20% to revenue from the mid-teens to couple of years ago. So, I guess two questions then. You talked about June service revenue is growing, so what was March revenue? Was it inline with the kind of 23% service bookings that you had?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: It's in the press release, Steve, so it's right there.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: All right. I missed that one, then. So can you just quantify the margin range on products versus service?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Bottom line, they are about the same. Operating margin level are about the same, at the company average.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: And the gross margin level?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Very dilutive on the gross margin; essentially, all the cost of service... all the cost of service is in gross margin. So, it's heavily dilutive in gross margin.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: We can talk about a number later. Your tax rate for the June quarter, what do you can make [ph] up?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: 32%.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Okay. And then last question is, that I am just curious, given kind of the increased competitive environment and industry wide reductions in lead times, have you guys changed your goal of trying to carry a couple of quarters of backlog deferred revenue. Do you think you have to manage that now, down lower going forward?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Steve, we've been managing it for a couple of years. I don't think the competitive landscape for KLA-Tencor had changed a great deal in the last three of four years. We are forever trying to help our customers by giving it to them exactly when they want it. So, it's to the extent, we have... and we're still able to keep the essential model that we've had for that same period of time, so I wouldn't guess that you will see it change very much.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Great, thanks.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth. Your line is open.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: Hi, thanks. Rick, a couple of quick follow-ups on the previous discussion. On the technology transitions and the industry shrinks et cetera, obviously a key driver for you. Are you seeing outside of the memory space, where they seem to be very aggressive; are you seeing people back away in any sense from the aggressive scaling we've seen in the past? TSMC has kind of talked about half node transitions, et cetera. Is there anything meaningful there from your perspective?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I think that it's a good observation. There is definitely... it's been slower outside of memory with the exceptions of microprocessor advances. So in the logic space, there has been slower transition in terms of the design rule. I think it's a function of a couple of things. One is the desire not to over invest and I think a lot of the foundries have been careful. And the other one is I think there has been not as much demand for the advanced design rules from their customers. But we also see signs that that's changing and I think that will result in an increased need for advanced capability. But it's still early in that.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: So not a secular trend that in some way affects you as more and more goes to the foundries and people go fab light, et cetera? Foundries ought to get back on track is what are you saying?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: I think in order to be competitive, they are going to have, otherwise they are going to face more competition from what are traditionally iDMs getting into their space. And there is enough pressure on that, but if they don't shrink, some of these fabless guys will find another path. So I think they are going to get pushed into it, that's our sense.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: Thanks, one more if I might. Back on the reticle side, you've introduced this wafer plane inspection. AMAT has something that sounds similar in terms of printability, stimulation, et cetera. Is there something that is happening here that could cause a discontinuity in terms of an investment cycle or is this stuff all kind of evolutionary? And what is driving this fundamentally? Is it increased sort of face shift masking and OPC that's now requiring this kind of functionality or what's happening here and is growth in the reticle space, is there any reasons to believe, it will be less than fairly linear? Is there an upgrade cycle coming from the industry, given what's happening in litho?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Raj, good question. I think that the general answer is, the reticles are bearing more of the brunt of trying to extend design rules. Because lithography immersion is out there, people will see what they can and they are trying to avoid, of course, going to double patterning although there is some inevitability to that for some customers. So the reticles are just getting pushed harder and the cost of reticles... the cost of design is high. So, a lot of that goes to reticle inspection. So we view that as a good opportunity. In terms of technologies, as you know with our market position in reticle, we model all the available architectures and we chose the WPI approach because when we look at that and we work with our customers, we are pretty confident we've got the best approach to dealing with that. So there have been competitors in this space and we believe there always will be. But we think we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the increased complexity of reticle, both in the mask shop and as it plays out for inspection measurement in the fabs.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: And are we at a point... just a quick follow on, are we at a point where incoming inspection, which is something I think you've tried for a while to encourage to expand the market, that incoming inspection in fabs becomes a larger and larger part of this business?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: I think it's... I think it has pretty good growth, but the mask shop growth is driven a little bit more on complexity. The... to answer your question, there are other ways to qualify reticles. And so the question is do people use the wafer inspection products to do it through print downs or do they use incoming and we think they are going to do some of both, and it's really customer preference. But I don't think it's... in particularly faster growing segment, I think it is consistent with the kind of growth we have seen in our reticle in the past.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: Right.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: So I... I mean, your first question, I don't see any revolutionary change, I think... I just think it's an increased challenge for the reticle guys and that drives the need for more and more inspection.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: Got it. Thank you.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: You got it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Olga Levinzon [ph]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Olga calling in for C.J. Muse. I had a couple of questions. Assuming that ICOS closes in June, I know you suggested it would be accretive in the first year, would we see any sort of dilution in the September quarter?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Olga, really difficult to tell right now. We haven't spent enough time with the folks from ICOS, we haven't finished the deal. So it's difficult to forecast that.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. And then can you talk about what sort of CapEx assumptions you're making at the low end versus the high end of your order guide and then that 500 to high 500s outlook that you have for the second half?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: You mean matching industry CapEx to our market position?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean we said, what, six or eight months ago, I guess now that we thought calendar 08 was going to be down 10% to 15%, and at the time obviously we appeared pessimistic, now that would be optimistic from a lot of people's perspective. So I think it is... again, we model it anywhere from down 20 to down 30, and --
Unidentified Analyst: Okay.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: That's... but so much uncertainty out there.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. Do you think, I mean you saw a pretty big uptick in foundry orders this quarter. Do you think... have you become a little bit incrementally more positive in that front? Or is this just kind of initial uptick like one to type of total deal?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: No, we do see the foundries... I think again investing more heavily in inspection and measurement then in production capacity, because of the new technologies and capabilities that they have to deal with. And then we think that looks pretty stable as we go forward. So we're not forecasting a big uptick in that. But we think it looks pretty solid in terms of their overall needs, and as you might imagine, we're in discussions with them all the time.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. And then I guess one final question. Would you... I mean you've talked about this higher need for reticle inspection as you go to 45-nanometer and below. Which of, I guess, within all of the spaces that you currently participate in, which ones do you think would outgrow the overall process control spaces or under grow?
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: We don't actually have to spend a lot of time working on that problem, and I will tell you why. As years ago, we figured it out, it's better to have portfolio solutions and let our customers pick. So some people think darkfield, some people would feel brightfield, some people think fair wafer. But our approach is to provide the capabilities our customers need and let them decide. So from that standpoint, it's a bit of non-answer. But part of our strategy is to have a large portfolio and let our customers do it because if they are very interdependent and people can emphasize one technology over the other. So we're not... we don't really have to play winners and losers when it comes to the specific segments inside our space.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Although we have 25 general managers around here, all say that it's going to grow faster than the others.
Unidentified Analyst: All right.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: And we sure don't want to anybody that they're not. So --
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks so much.
Richard P. (Rick) Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up question from Timothy Arcuri. Your line is open.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi guys. John, you know you've now gone basically two cycles. If I look back at the trough of the last cycle and I assume that things don't get too much worse from here. You've now basically gone two cycles where you are earning significantly in excess of your cost to capital, in the trough of the cycle. So I am wondering, now that you have proven that model, what your view is on putting some leverage onto the balance sheet? Thanks.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: You're not going to give me the day off here, are you, Tim? You know our strategy hasn't changed, our vision hasn't changed, just off the top of my head, if I think about last two years, we've returned about $2 billion worth of cash to shareholders, either through our dividend or through buybacks. We're focused on growing the company in process control or inspection and measurement. We see plenty of opportunities as the world comes up with smaller and smaller things that become more and more complicated that have to get measured and data that has to get shared from process step to process step. And if we have to change the... we continue to change the capital structure, the company do that well... clearly we will. But no need at this point.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks, John.
Operator: Your last question comes from Ben Pang. Your line is open sir.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: Thank you for taking my question. You commented that over 50% of your orders are 45-nanometer. Do you expect that that is the mix that you see for the second half of the year, calendar year? And if that's true, does that mean you don't really need to see the DRAM capacity spending come back in order to get your kind of flattish outlook here for order?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: No, Ben, we don't... I couldn't answer what it is past the June quarter. But I definitely see 45-nanometer and below being above 50% again for the June ending quarter. God, I hope DRAM doesn't go away, but we feel pretty good about what we call the technology buys across our entire product line going forward with the transitions to the smaller line versus the smaller... the changes in the transistor et cetera.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: And could you provide the share count guidance again?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Off the top of my head, I think I said 179 million.
Benedict Pang - Caris & Company: Perfect. Thank you very much.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Be good, Ben.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thanks everybody for attending the call and we will talk to you again in 90 days.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your line.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Cara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead Sir.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Cara. Good Afternoon, and welcome to KLA-Tencor's second quarter fiscal year 2008 earnings conference call. I'm Jeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our CEO and John Kispert, our President and COO. We are here today to discuss our second quarter results for the period ended December 31st, 2007. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 PM Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release you can find it on our website, www.kla-tencor.com, or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today's call with highlights from the quarter, updates on the current market environment and key product activity and provide guidance for the March quarter. Afterwards, I'll review the preliminary financial results for the quarter and then I'll open the call for questions. On the investor section of our website, you will find a simulcast of this call which will be accessible on demand for 90 days. On the website you will also find a calendar for investor events and presentations at investor conferences. You will also find links to KLA-Tencor's security filings. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that can impact our future results. And as you know our future results are subject to risk. Any forward-looking statements we make, including those we'll make on the call today, are subject to those risks. KLA Tencor cannot guarantee that those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. And although we take obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you can be assured that any updates we do make will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. And with that I'll turn it over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Jeff, and thank you all for joining us for our Q2 earnings call this afternoon. Today I will discuss highlights from the December quarter, provide an update on the current market environment, discuss our four strategic objectives and give guidance for the March quarter. Pleased to report that we once again produced solid operating results in the December quarter. Revenue was $636 million in line with guidance for the quarter. Net income, including some one-time charges, was above the range of guidance, $138 million or $0.75 per diluted share. We generated approximately $126 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter. Jeff Hall will provide additional details on the Company's financial highlights later in the call. Orders for the December quarter were $580 million, up 20% from the September quarter, in line with our guidance for the period. I would now like to discuss the current bookings environment, provide some more perspective on our various customer segment. In general, the slowing demand environment we first began to experience late in September continues in each of our markets and all indications today point to this condition persisting the next several months, reflecting the impact of the slowing overall macroeconomic climate. As a result, our customers have become more in their conservative capital investment. Laying or reducing in size, many of the larger capacity addition projects that have been planned for the next two to three quarters while sustaining their investment developing advanced technology. As those of you who have been following the company over the years are aware, we take advantage of these periods of contraction in capital spending, leveraging our strong financial resources, technology expertise, solid customer relationships, to step up our investment and innovation, anticipating our customers' next generation inspection and measurement need. So, when the demand climate improves again, we're in a stronger position than ever to capitalize on resurging growth to extend our market lead. I'll have more to say regarding our customer focus and the first of our investment, but first I'll provide some perspective on the current bookings environment, in our various customer segments. Memory was, once again, our largest customer segment during the December quarter. Memory orders were stronger than expected in the period. We saw particularly strong demand from one of our large diversified memory customers based in Korea. Memory customers today are investing in advance technology and new materials to enable smaller design role, higher density applications as well as reduced cost. In turn, driving increased adoption of process control to reduce the affectivity. Looking ahead we expect memory CapEx to be choppy, though seeing continued interest in process control as memory manufacturers struggle with yield in metrology challenges. Advance node, foundry demand was below plan in December. As one large foundry customer reduced its order forecast in the quarter; another significant order was pushed out. Historically, foundry customers have always been heavy adopters of process control given the unique nature of their business. Unique to foundries is the challenge of managing ever increasing number of products and processes while at the same time continually reduce their time to market. These conditions makes achieving targeted yields in a shorter period of time critical to success in this segment. While some major foundries have reported reduced CapEx forecast a continuing need for process control due to the nature of foundry business to be a driver for our business going forward. Logic orders in the December quarter were above our forecast as we saw upside from two of our US based logic customers. We see investment in leading edge technology as a major driver of demand in the logic segment over the next few quarters. Summarized, although our near-term visibility has become more crowded and order of timing less predictable over the last several weeks, the increased complexity our customers are facing as they invest in advanced technology creating new yield and effectively challenges driving the need for advanced inspection and measurement technology and accelerating adoption of process control. As a result even in a period of slowing overall wafer manufacturing equipment demand, we expect process controls to continue to outperform the industry in the order of 5% or more in 2008. And in spite of the continued uncertainty as to the timing of some large projects, our long term pipeline remains strong. Now I would like to discuss some recent highlights for KLA-Tencor. Our four strategic objectives: customer focus, growth, operational excellence and talent goal. Customer focus is the first of our four strategic objectives in KLA-Tencor. Work hard to understand our customer's requirement and provide solutions in every market that they serve. Today we enjoy a position leading market share in almost all markets that we serve. The key to our success has been to collaborate closely with our customers innovate with them to develop creative and differentiated solutions and execute in bringing the products to market, supporting them throughout their lifecycle. Pleased to report that in the December quarter, we sustained our market leadership in each of the key markets and product lines that we serve. As always a great deal of hard work was required to win the bid and even more challenging an environment when capital was tight our customers have to make sure the premium we get on our product was worth the additional investment. I applaud our team's hard work and successful execution in particularly difficult period. Here are some highlights from the December quarter in our core inspection and metrology market where we offer a broad portfolio of inspection products serving semi-conductors, bare-wafer and write off the [ph] markets. As in the past our teams did a good job of demonstrating our value and we are pleased with the market share performance across our inspection project. Here are just a few examples of some recent wins in the inspection and metrology space. The 2810 full-spectrum brightfield tool introduced in July 2007 and designed specifically for memory application, and a large capacity of expansion order with a Korean memory manufacturer in December quarter demonstrating superior sensitivity, capture of unique defect segment for us [ph], and throughput reaching twice the computing speed of earlier generation brightfield tool, as well as new optical modes able to increase defect protection. We also won follow-on orders for the 2810 brightfield tool with a Taiwanese memory manufacturer head-to-head competition. In the quarter we made the first place with a flash manufacturer of our Puma 9150 darkfield inspection platform. And this Puma solution was chosen in head-to-head competition after a rigorous competitive evaluation, demonstrating a superior throughput, stability and reliability for production-proven system against the competition. Our new e-beam review and classification tool, EDR 5200 was recently declared tool of record at a major Taiwanese foundry. Continued penetration of major memory manufacturers in the quarter, placements at four major memory manufacturers during this time-period. EDR 5200 is an e-beam review solution that also enhances resolution improving the productivity of our inspectors. Our e-beam review tool provides connectivity with inspectors to improve brightfield recipes while also delivering very high resolutions in page accuracy, allowing maximum capture of defects on a review system. We believe the EDR 5200 provides a great solution and positions us for growth in this new market. Metrology, KLA-Tencor continues to be the market-leader by offering a comprehensive suite of metrology products that gives our customers the ability to maintain tight control over process window. In December quarter we were successful in winning new business by demonstrating superior performance in optical CD, film, overlay metrology or advanced applications in memory, foundry, logic. December quarter, we successfully demonstrated performance of our next-generation overlay metrology platform. A critical logic customer demonstrating significant performance improvement for existing overlays solution as well as demonstrating the capability to extend the technology into future requirement. These are just a few examples of recent success which KLA-Tencor achieved during the December quarter, solving our customers' mission-critical production problem, and expanding our market leadership. Across the industry the technical challenges our customers are facing are significant. We are working closely with them to solve those problems. In addition to that, we are well positioned going forward based upon our product pipeline fueled by our R&D investment across our portfolio. The second strategic objective for KLA-Tencor is growth. Our goal is to continue to outgrow the industry. Our growth prospects continue to look good, even in this challenging CapEx environment. Based upon the investments by customers in each of our market segments, driving forward in their advanced technology roadmap. Increasing need for inspection and measurement, pipe-makers address the greater complexity that yield challenges in advance design rule. We estimate the increased adoption of process control by chip manufacturers at 45-nanometers translates to an incremental revenue opportunity for KLA-Tencor of 30% or more as compared with a 65-nanometer node. We saw evidence of that potential in our relative growth performance in 2007 compared with the overall wafer fab equipment market. KLA-Tencor revenue growth of 17% in 2007 outpaced the estimated industry growth for the year of about 5%. I said earlier in remarks, we believe we are well positioned to continue to outgrow the industry, result of the increased challenges of 45-nanometers based upon new markets that we have entered during calendar '07. During 2007, we entered six new markets, both, organically and through M&A activity, increasing our potential addressable market by more than $700 million, a size by industry analyst. That being said, we are very selective about the growth prospects that we pursue. We would only enter markets that present growth prospects that will enable profitable growth. While, we are willing to be patient, we'll have to make sure we can differentiate and add value, grow in each market that we enter. In addition to the six new markets that we entered during calendar '07, we have more growth initiatives in place at KLA-Tencor. We will be providing updates as they materialize. Our strategy would be to continue our organic efforts as well as leveraging our ability especially use acquisition as a way to enter new market. Our third strategy objective at KLA-Tencor is operational excellence. A year ago we laid out a four-year plan to drive continued improvement in our business model by driving operational excellence throughout the company. We have made steady progress on our plans and have seen the results of our efforts. Jeff will go through the details of our progress in his prepared remark, but the net result, the actions we have been taking over the past several quarters to achieve higher levels of profitability begin to show up in our last quarter. Our fourth objective at KLA-Tencor is talent development. None of the success that KLA-Tencor enjoys would be possible without our world-class work force. Historically, we have developed world-class talent and achieved outstanding financial results through the cycles of the industry. We are increasing our efforts in talent development. Know that our people are the key to our success. In summary, KLA-Tencor continues to be a company with an unparallel portfolio of inspection and measurement technology, enjoying relationships with every major IC manufacturer, great people who are driven by an unwavering passion for innovation and commitment to ensure our success. These unique attributes are what have sparked our market leadership over the past 31 years, refueled our strong financial performance, driving the resources for continued innovation, strong foundation for growth. We believe these attributes help to position KLA-Tencor to continue to outgrow the industry in 2008 and beyond. I would like to wrap up my comments now by giving you our guidance for the March quarter. Orders are expected to be down 10% plus or minus 10% from the December quarter. Revenue is expected to be between $575 million and $595 million, EPS in the range of $0.60 to $0.64, including stock-based compensation, including one-time charges. Now, I will turn the call back over to John.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Rick. We had another quarter of solid operational execution in December. Even though revenue was down 8% as expected, gross margin was up and both operating margin and EPS were flat with the prior quarter. This strong margin performance was the result of two factors. First, the actions we have been taking over the past several quarters to globalize our operations, reduce overhead and streamline our cost structure to achieve higher levels of profitability and cash flow began to show up in the P&L this quarter; and second, we continued to execute well in our M&A integration efforts. In December, we accelerated the integration of our recent acquisition, and today, with margin dilution from these deals essentially zero, we have achieved our short-term goals a few months ahead of schedule. Our ability to quickly integrate these acquisitions and get them at/or above company average margin is the result of great efforts by our operating team to get the systems converted, the product lines rationalized, the sales and service efforts consolidated into our channels, and of course, the elimination of a lot of duplicate activity. Although our industry is currently in a challenging demand environment, as a result of the successful integration of these accretive acquisitions and the business model improvements we have been making, our financial model is stronger than ever. Margins are higher, operating expenses are lower, we are generating more cash flow on a quarterly basis and our service annuity business has grown by over 45% in the last six quarters. For the calendar year, our revenue was up 17% compared to about 10% for process control and about 5% for wafer fab equipment, as demand for our new products drove market shares to historic highs and increased adoption of KLA-Tencor solutions. Our operational excellence efforts leveraged the 17% top-line growth to create 49% operating margin growth year-over-year. Incremental gross margin was 70% and incremental operating margin was 66%. Of course, we are not going to rest here. The completion of the integration efforts will allow us to put even greater efforts on other initiatives, the continued transition of manufacturing and supply chain to Asia, improving our service delivery and spare parts distribution models and improving efficiencies in other areas of our business. Now, let me spend a minute going through the quarter in more detail. In general, the slowing demand environment we first began to experience in the late September quarter continues to prevail in each of our markets, and today our visibility is very low. Net bookings for the quarter were $580 million, which is up 20% from the September quarter. This net bookings number includes $22 million of de-booking. Every quarter we scrub our backlog line-by-line and de-book any order we do not expect to ship in the next 12 months. The product distribution of orders was wafer inspection at approximately 48%, radical inspection was approximately 10%, metrology was 20%, and service was 22%. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion of backlog, $827 million of shipment backlog for orders that have not yet shipped and $437 million of revenue backlog for products that have been shipped but have not yet been signed off by customers. Remember, we do not include any service bookings or revenue in this backlog. And as I said earlier, our service business has grown by more than 45% over the last six quarters and is currently adding about $122 million per quarter of revenue. We remain confident that we have a strong backlog that's shippable over the next six to nine months. Our ability to maintain this significant level of, both, shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain high levels of profitability throughout any business cycle. Now turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $636 million, down 8% compared with the previous quarter, and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance for the December quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 55.2%, and this includes $16.5 million of charges for de-related amortization. Excluding these items, gross margins, including, stock options was 57.8%, up about 40 basis points from September, despite a decline in shipments from 707 to 588. This is a result of the elimination of dilution from the recent acquisitions ahead of schedule, as well as the realization of cost reductions in our Singapore facility. In the March quarter, we expect gross margins to be slightly lower as a result of the lower levels of product revenue. Operating expenses were $257 million. This number includes an $8.5 million charge for de-related amortization, a $67 million charge for legal fees related to the stock options investigation, as during the quarter we entered into an agreement, in principle, relating to the settlement of securities class action losses. These charges were partially offset by a gain of $9 million on the sale of our manufacturing facility in Livermore. Excluding these items, operating expenses were $191 million, down $13 million quarter-to-quarter as the efforts we have been taking over the last six quarters to reduce the breakeven point of the Company started to bear fruit and the dilution from acquisition was eliminated ahead of schedule. Breaking down operating expenses, R&D expenses were down $6 million quarter-to-quarter as the reductions resulting from the consolidation of acquired R&D program offset the increasing spending a new technology and customers collaborations at 45-nanometers and below. SG&A expenses were down approximately $7 million quarter-to-quarter. In this period of contraction in demand, we will continue to accelerate our investment in R&D, both on n plus two innovations and on growth program. So that when the demand climate improves again, we are in stronger position than ever to capitalize on the resurging growth, extend our market lead and grow into new markets. These increases in R&D spending will be offset by continuing reductions in SG&A, and as a result going forward we expect operating expenses to be flat to slightly down. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%, down 30 basis points from the prior quarter as we were able to hold margins despite the reductions in shipments and revenue. For the quarter, other income was $13.3 million. In the March quarter, we expect other income to be approximately $15 million. The tax rate was 21.4% in the quarter. Excluding one-time item, the tax rate was 28%. Net income for the quarter was $84 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Excluding the charges discussed earlier, net income was $138 million or $0.75 per diluted share. This number includes share-based compensation expenses of $24 million, and in the March quarter we expect expenses for share-based compensation to be about $26 million. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, an increase of $14 million quarter-to-quarter. In the quarter we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares and paid a dividend of $28 million. After these share repurchases, approximately 8.4 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under our existing program. Cash from operations was $126 million in the quarter, as we made a $105 million tax payment, about $65 million higher than normal as a result of the sale of IP to our Singapore company, we discussed last quarter. Inventory decreased by $17 million to $483 million, and accounts receivable finished the quarter at $579 million, down $40 million from the prior quarter. Net capital expenditures were negative $3 million, as the proceeds from the sale of our Livermore facility more than offset capital acquisitions in the quarter. Depreciation was $14.3 million, so on that basis, including retirement, fix assets decreased by $70 million quarter-over-quarter. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter at $185 million, and headcount was approximately 5,800. Finally, as we commented earlier, we are in a period of very low visibility. Given this environment, we are continuing to run our Company in a way that will maintain us... allow us to maintain high levels of investment in next generation technology and in collaboration with our customers while maintaining our high levels of profitability and cash flow for several quarters. With that our guidance for the quarter is bookings down 10%, plus or minus 10 points; revenue between $575 million and 595 million; and EPS of $0.60 to $0.64. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call for questions.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Let me request you to take refrain from asking multipart questions to give other some time. And as always, we are on a tight schedule. Cara, can you begin the polling please. Question And Answer
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Thank you, and good afternoon. Looking at the soft near-term environment, I am just wondering which segments are going to be weaker. I am assuming that it's Taiwan DRAM and the foundries, but maybe the team can shed some light on the situation here?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Harlan, yes, I think, it is. Frequently we have seen some softening at foundries, we do expect foundries to pick up a little bit, but that's being said they were off more than we expected in the December quarter. And I think memory, as we said, we think the forecast is generally pretty choppy. As you know, the challenge for the memory customers is they invest and if they don't invest, then, of course, it's hard to stay in the game. So that's really I think a decision that many of the memory customers have to make right now.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Has there been any relative differences between weakness from the DRAM suppliers versus the NAND flash suppliers?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Last quarter, I think, we... sorry, DRAM actually was up quarter-on-quarter as a percent from our flash. So it really kind of comes in pretty lumpy, I think, would be the best way to do it.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then just one quick follow-up question. Just wondering, if you guys could just give us an update on the ramp of the Singapore facility, where you are in terms of capacity and where you expect to be over the next couple of quarters?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Hey, Harlan, John Kispert. We had... it's a pretty key quarter for us in the transition to Singapore, we essentially shipped every SP2 for the company came out of Singapore, and as you know that's flagship... one of the flagship products for KLA-Tencor. And the focus for the team has really been in predictability, and they passed with flying colors in quality, obviously... out of box quality and have passed with flying colors. So, we are lining up two more products that over the next six to nine months will be starting up in Singapore. We are seeing the cost advantages that we had hope through the supply chain. Cleary, we are closer to many of our customers there too, and that's given us substantial leverage in collaborating and in our support infrastructure.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Jeff, shipment expectations in the March quarter?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: About same as this quarter. Between 575 and 600.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: 575-600. Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Deana with JP Morgan.
Jay Deana - JP Morgan: Thank you. Good afternoon. Guys last week in New York, Applied did a analyst meeting and they put out some aggressive projections of gaining 10-15 percentage points of share in process control. Just kind of wondering what the strategy is to make sure that doesn't happen?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Jay, good question. I think we have had attracted competitors in our space, as you know for many years and we have heard some more claims from competitors in the past. Our challenge is really to be clear on game and that means we keep investing in R&D and we have been doing that. So, we are close to get out customers, we are pretty confident in our position, competitive position and also with what's on roadmap, so our strategy is really to continue to focus on satisfying our customer need. And ultimately customers will make those decisions based on the products that we provide. So, really no change of strategy. It's not exact for the first time somebody has said they are coming after our market.
Jay Deana - JP Morgan: Okay, quick follow-up. If I see units grow say 12% to 13% this year. Do you think that it's feasible for that to happen with CapEx down 10-15, maybe more percent?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I mean, feasible. If you see the... Jay it's all about the ESPs, obviously. But from our standpoint, when we talk to our customers, I think, what you are getting out is the visibility of CapEx spend... right now, as we said it's pretty murky out there. And that we have very little short term visibility and probably even less long term.
Jay Deana - JP Morgan: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Hodess, your line is open. [Operator Instructions] We will move to the next questionnaire. And your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you so much for the question. Guys the question is, obviously, the reason we are in the environment right now because we have too much supply. How comfortable are you that if we just sort of could eradicate the excess supply today that going forward we are not adding too much capacity. In other words even in Q1 of '08 are we adding still too much supply that we are going to have to absorb, or is this just a function of excess capacity that needs to be absorbed that was added last year?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Hey Jim, John Kispert. It's really hard for us to tell. I mean, I will give you what we do see. It's hard for me to directly answer your question. If I look at the sales funnel in front of us over the next six months in all of our systems, it's actually a higher number than the number we're giving you. We're putting our far windage as the senior management team that we think it will be a little bit lower for... really for the reason you're mentioning. Inside of that though, the orders that look most likely to us are more around next generation technology buys than they are on capacity adds. There are, certainly, opportunities for quicker capacity adds but those are the ones that we... that are getting discussed and we're going after them, of course, but we are certainly not putting into the model for the company going forward. But I'd say, that your question still very much in play and hard to understand. Right now, I think over the next 60 to 90 days it certainly will play itself out. We'll be in much better position, that's our conservative guidance.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thanks a million John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Bismel Loui [ph] for Satya Kumar. One of your peers earlier in the day, not a competitor, was talking about pricing pressure in the market are due to profitability of your customers. And now both of you have the same set of customers, so I'm wondering can you talk a little about pricing trends for KLA, especially in the process control market?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: It's always a good question. I'd say that there isn't a quarter that's gone by over the last 15 years, that we haven't had some pricing pressures. Every deal that goes out there, we're competing against. As Rick said earlier, very worthy competitors, typically we are at a higher price, premium price, but we have learnt through the years is it's all about having the close collaboration with our customers and having the technology, that has the highest performance and the highest throughput and the highest sensitivity. And that what wins and the lowest cost of ownership by the way also. And that's what wins, so I... there has been no change, I would say, in the last year or even the last 90 days as far as pricing pressure. We feel it every quarter I don't know if it's an upturn or downturn.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Also can you... you normally split orders by device segment right. Can you split that for the December quarter?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: About 57% memory and about 28% logic and about 15% foundry.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And one final question I have is what percent of your revenues is represented by your biggest customer?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: We don't have anybody that is 10% customer.
Unidentified Analyst: Oh, there is not.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Above 10%. In this environment most folks are, the biggest ones would be around 5% in the quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Lehman Brothers.
Olga Levintan - Lehman Brother: Hi this is Olga Levintan calling in for CJ. I had a couple of questions. On the last call you suggested that looking through 2008, you probably see a revenue run rate in a low to mid-600. Given your guidance for March, do you sort of see that playing, is that the case still, or do you see it being more flattish?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we don't give guidance out more than one quarter. As we said it's a pretty murky environment for us right now and 575 to 595 is a revenue range that we are comfortable in that, in this environment. The environment changes that may change, but that's where we are today. The good news for us is that, as we move into this environment, we have done so much operating improvement over the last several quarters that we can hold operating margins above 20% even at those lower levels.
Olga Levintan - Lehman Brother: Got you. And then assuming that CapEx is down, our model suggesting down probably 15% to 20% would you... are you sticking by the... your revenue line basically outperforming that by about 5% or is that sort of...
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Absolutely, we historically outgrow, we will continue to outgrow, nothing has changed there.
Olga Levintan - Lehman Brother: Okay. And then can you give us, given the orders you have seen in your e-beam product. Can you talk about your current share and what your target is for 2008 and what your target is for your existing inspection and metrology products?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we don't break out share by product line. We talk kind of broader in the inspection area, I think by e-beam you mean our review product. In that case, that's... in most of our markets, as you know, we have leading position, 18 out of 20, that's one of the two where we don't. And what we have seen is some steady progress, we believe that over the course of the next couple of years we will continue to build our share position in that. But as I also said, we want to grow on a way that's profitable, so there is, sometimes you have people that try to enter our market and will do it at a very low cost and define that that's very dilutive to their business model, we won't do that with this, we are going to differentiate and so it's going to a while. The good news about slowdown, if there is any good news is it does give our customers more time to evaluate our new products. And we find that that they are liking what they see with our review product.
Olga Levintan - Lehman Brother: So, you haven't really set a specific goal, you are just sort of doing it customer-by-customer...
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: No, we have a specific goal, we haven't, we don't talk externally, the team is well aware of this specific.
Olga Levintan - Lehman Brother: Alright, and then I guess one final question, on the Singapore fab. Are you still expecting a one point gross margin improvement in the March quarter from the transition?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: I've been overseeing solid gross margin already... we stared to see the benefits in the December quarter where we had gross margins going up despite a decline in shipments and asset gross margin down slightly on lower product revenues going forward. Certainly, we're incredibly happy with the performance of our team in Singapore and excited about the continued ramp there.
Olga Levintan - Lehman Brother: Okay. Thanks so much, that's all I have.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi, couple of things, I guess, first thing. Can you... you broke out orders by customer. Can you break out memory by NAND and DRAM, than I have a follow-up?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: About 40% NAND... 40% of memory is NAND.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay. And then Jeff, you and I talked about this before. But if you plot your orders even out to the March quarter and you look at your share of the overall wafer fab equipment pie, and you compare that to a last couple of cycles, usually during a downturn, you guys always gain share, book share. And this time looking out to the March quarter, it doesn't look like you are. You gained a little in December. But then it kind of lost back in March, so when you look from peak to trough, it doesn't look like you are gaining share of the overall fab budget. And I'm wondering is that maybe because we haven't seen it yet and it will come in June and September it's kind of coming later this cycle or why do you think that the data shows that or in fact do you think that the data is wrong.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Well I think, what I heard you say was, we gained shares through December but maybe giving it back a little bit in March?
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Yes, I am just saying that if you... because your orders are up more in December then everyone else's are, but then they're down more than most companies probably will be in March. So, I am saying, if you look holistically from the peak to March it doesn't look like, you have gained much share of the overall fab budget, when you have during prior downturns, and I am kind of wondering, why that might be?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: I think, we like to stick with the facts for the moment. But through December it looks okay, let's see how March comes out. But we are happy with our product set, we see products, process control continuing to pick up with our customers, we are seeing increased demand, solid pricing high market share, I don't think we are not done.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Gary Hsueh with Oppenheimer.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: Thanks for taking my question. My question refers to or is about the breadth of the market. I mean you talked about this Korean customer diversified shift. I mean if you took that one customer out, I mean what would be you order guidance here for margin, where the orders have been sequentially in December, just trying to get an idea here about how, how broad the market actually is?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Gary, this is John Kispert. I will read between the lines here, you are talking about one particular customer in Korea that ?
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: Yes, every company now that is having conference calls right now, is just talking really about that one customer, I don't know if you know but Lam Research is talking about it. And the impact of that one customer on margins, they are seeing a little bit of margin pressure due to pricing for that one big customer, so it sounds like the breadth of the market is pretty narrow?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Yes, I wouldn't say that with us. I think our memory for December was, and we don't like talking specifically about customers for obvious reasons, so listen closely, memory is... was broader for us in December than you are implying. And in the March quarter, it's broader than you are also implying, it's not to say that both of our large customers in Korea spend with us every quarter. It's either to add capacity or next generation technologies. I think both of them... right now, we're working very closely on next generation technologies and... but I don't, either in our guidance or in what we've booked this last quarter that we have a huge part of the order book coming from one particular customer.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: Okay. Just a follow-on, since everybody else is asking a multipart question. Just to imply that since you don't have that much exposure in any one customer, there is really not any concern here in the near term future about the impact of pricing on margins. I think couple of your peers are talking about that right now as we speak.
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: We have over $1 billion worth of backlog. We feel very good about it. As Jeff looks at it, he feels as though there is more upside than downside in our margin. We work very closely with all of our customers. I don't see a huge change in any of our pricing going forward. You never know. We work creatively with our customers, also to do everything we can to get them what they need and so they can be successful.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: Okay, John, and one last one. Just in terms of gross margin flexing down on incremental basis, still business is usual around the 60% to 70%?
John Kispert - President and Chief Operating Officer: Going down is a lot harder. I think you understand the math on it. But, we definitely not coming off that model, it feels very good.
Gary Hsueh - Oppenheimer: Alright, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much. Jeff, thanks for giving out those details on the charges in the press release. That was very helpful. Hopefully you can continue that. My question is on the weakness. Can you give us a timeframe when you... when the weakness started developing? Is this something very recent or it has been there, or put it the other way, would your order guidance have been the same if it was two weeks ago?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Weakness started in September. We started talking about in September call. Certainly, it's got murkier since then. I mean, would have been two weeks ago... no possible way. I think it's the same.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: No, I was referring more towards the last call you suggested that March orders will actually be up, so that's... with reference to that I am asking that question.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: If you look at our sales funnel today, anyone of our sales systems in the company in which we spend a lot of time examining, almost on a daily basis nowadays, it's actually a higher number than we are telling you. We are less convinced. We are taking an ultra conservative position on it. There are folks in the Company who think March could be better, and June could be better, but given the environment that we are operating in, visibility is very low. We are, again, taking an ultra conservative position and with the big backlog and looks to kind of write this out and be in position... better position, both, from a market share and new product portfolio, when and if the upturn starts.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: But, to just add to that. I think, if you look back 30 days, the climate has gotten worse not better.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: I think that's the nature of your question.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Just I have one quick question on the radical inspections. It seems like radical inspection is following semi-cap kind of trend, it has been weak for a couple of quarters. Should we think of radical inspection similar to semi-cap, I thought that was mostly to March, also they will have a different cycle?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: It's a combination of couple of things. One, it has a lot to do with actually our product introduction cycle in radical. The more we bring out new technologies and new capabilities, we will see increasing demand. So, you are right, we have seen some fluctuation with the overall cycle, but it is definitely true that overall radical is little bit off cycle. The other thing that some of our radical business now is in wafer fabs, so that tends to be more tied to the wafer fab and that's probably a little bit different than it was a few years ago. But an overwhelming factor is new generation. So when we look forward we see new technologies coming out then we expect to see increases in radical as a result.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from line Hari Chandra with Deutsche Bank.
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. Question is regarding new products you have introduced recently and also the one that you alerted in the earnings release, basically [ph] total available market for them, and how much of incremental sales do you expect from them in 2008?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: We could barely hear you. The question was?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: New products we talked about in the earnings release is that the...
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Am I clear now?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes, much better Hari, go ahead.
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Regarding the new products, I just wanted to know the total available market for them, and how much incremental sales do you expect from them in 2008?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Sure. The products that we talked about in the press release are products that are just continuation, evolution of the product lines that we have. So, those are cases where we are bringing out newer technology, but those are really the same market segment. In prepared remarks, we talked about the new markets that we have entered which we said is about a $700 million tam opportunity over the last year that we are now involved in. That makes sense?
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Yes. And how much incremental contribution do you expect from the new products in this year?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Yes, if you look at our backlog, Hari, it's about... I'd 85% of our backlog today is our products that we've introduced in the last 12 months.
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Okay.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: And another $0.15... 15%, frankly, is for trailing edge. Quick turn kind of backlog. So, it's really all of our products are we're shipping today for, where these kind of gross margins that you're seeing are products of our latest generation.
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Sure. And just a quick follow-up on the share repurchases. Should we expect the share repurchase activity to accelerate in the face of a cyclical weakness?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: No, we don't like to talk about what's currently going on, but we still have 8.5 million shares authorized and we're definitely out in the market everyday, and it is a dollar cost averaging kind of program with the lower the prices the more we buyback.
Hari Chandra - Deutsche Bank: Sure, appreciate it. Thank you.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: We have time one more question, Cara.
Operator: Your final question will come from the line of Ben Pang, Caris & Company.
Ben Pang - Caris & Company: Thanks for taking my question. When you guys comment on outgrowing the industry by like 5%, with the overall mix of customer change meaning, your memory in total is like 75% and logic is 15%, foundry 10%. Does it just follow along the same lines or you guys actually outgrow, let's say on logic or something? Can you give some color around that?
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Yes we kind of, we back up and we say what the industry growth rate looks like, overall? And our target is the growth from a top stand perspective to make sure we have programs and products in place to be able to achieve the growth. And the best example is look back in 2007, the industry grew 5%, so we grew at 17% revenue. That was example of significantly outgrowing the industry. Now to your point, there are specific segments that grow faster then others and the questions is how are we positioned? Since most of our products serve multiple segments, it's really more about the use case in those customers. That being said sometimes we have specific products to support specific customer types. So, we have a memory product, the 2810 I talked about, which really is target at memory performance. So, we set the goal to be overall for the industry, but then we have specific products and programs depending on the segment. Does that make sense?
Ben Pang - Caris & Company: Yes, one just quick follow-up. I mean, you talked about foundries being down. In your 5% growth you have a different forecast on the industry average for foundry?
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: In our 5%
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: ... growing 5% faster, no, not really. The foundries are interesting because they drive us in a different way than memory does. Memory drives, leading edge design rules, foundries drive the need for a lot of product changes. So, we don't... if what you are asking us, we count on foundries to achieve our growth target, the answer is, no. It just exercises a different part of our product portfolio and a different kind of capability on our tools. But we can grow with really any customers spending. We do need some spending money.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Hey, Ben, let me just... I will summarize I think I know where you going on this. On foundries, historically, we have done extraordinarily well, just given the business model and what their focus is on, etcetera. So, we as a company, we like it when the foundries want to expand capacity. One big change over the last year that Rich really pushed hard for with all of us is more focus in tailoring every one of our product lines to the applications in memory. So, we are in much better shape in the other segment, to say we were years ago. As far as growth with either memory of NAND, where they are pushing lean edge... but the adoption is actually higher than say years ago. That makes sense?
Ben Pang - Caris & Company: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you everyone for your time. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

After the speakers remarks, there will bea question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.  I would now like to turn theconference over to Mr. Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead,sir. 
Jeff Hall: Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoonand welcome to KLA-Tencor's first quarter fiscal year 2008 Earnings Call. I amJeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer. Joining me today are Rick Wallace, ourCEO; and John Kispert, our President and COO.  We are here today to discuss ourfirst quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2007. We releasedthese results this afternoon at 1:15 pm Pacific time. If you haven't seen therelease you can find it on our website at www.kla-tencor.com, or call408-875-3600 to request a copy.  Rick will lead off today's callwith highlights from the Septemberquarter update on the current market environment and key product activity, andprovide guidance for the December quarter. Afterwards, I will review thepreliminary financial results for the quarter and then I'll open the call upfor questions.  In the investor section of ourwebsite you’ll find the simulcast of this call, which will be accessible ondemand for 90 days. On the website you’ll also find a calendar for investorevents and presentation at investor conferences. You will also find links toKLA-Tencor's security filings.

Andalthough we take no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, youcan be assured that any update we do make will be broadly disseminated andavailable over the web.  And with that, I will turn itover to Rick. 
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Jeff, and thank youall for joining us for our Q1 earnings call this afternoon. Today I’ll bediscussing highlights from the September quarter updates on the current marketenvironment and update on our four strategic objectives and guidance for theDecember quarter.  I am pleased to report that weonce again produce solid operating results. Revenue was $693 million at theupper-end of our range of guidance for the quarter. Net income excluding someone time charges was also at the upper-end of guidance and $146 million or$0.76 per diluted share. And we generated approximately $205 million in cashflow from operations in the quarter.  Jeff Hall will provide additionaldetails on the company’s financial highlights later in the call. Orders for theSeptember quarter were $482 million down 32% from the June quarter. Again,September has historically been a difficult period for bookings of KLA-Tencorsince it is our first fiscal quarter.  This first quarter seasonalitywas compounded by a general end market weakness, which resulted in timingdelays for some orders and certain logic and DRAM customers during the last fewweeks of the quarter. Some of these or those who currently shifted into nextyear. In addition during last week of September we found that we are not ableto reach final terms with a few customers, and as a result these orders did notclose in September and will be shifting to December.  During the final weeks of thequarter, we also experienced a weakened demand in our other end marketsincluding Logic, Foundry, Reticle, Fair Way for end service. This softening in demand willlikely result in some orders that we are expected to book during September andDecember moving into calendar 2008.  I would like to take a fewmoments to clarify the current bookings environment by commenting on ourcustomer base by customer segment. Memory was once again our largest segmentduring the first quarter, the current climate. The Memory customers are similarto what we've experienced over the past six months, i.e. the memory bip rategrowth continues to be strong, despite persistent unit price declines in bothDRAM and NAND Flash, and an unfavorable balance of supply and demand in DRAM.As memory and unit demand is expected to gain strength, due to seasonality inthe proliferation of new applications, our memory customers are continuing toinvest in advanced technologies and new materials to enable smaller designrules and higher density applications and to reduce cost which in turn leads toincreased adoption of process control to drive down the affectivity.  Looking ahead, we expect overallmemory CapEx to be choppy. But have seen an increased interest in processcontrol as memory manufacturers struggle with the yield and metrologychallenges of advanced notes. Foundry orders in September were down following astrong June quarter as we expected. Historically, the level of adoption ofprocess control for Foundry customers has always been driven by the nature ofthe foundry business, faster learning cycles during development and theincreased mix of products inside the foundries and reduced time to market.These conditions make achieving targeted yields in a shorter period of timecritical to the success of the foundry segment.  While some major foundries havereported reduced CapEx forecast, their increased need for process control dueto the nature of the Foundry business will continue to be a driver for ourbusiness.  Logic orders in the Septemberquarter came in lower than expected, as upside from one MPU customer was offsetby the push out of the meaningful order from another U.S.-based customer, whohas recently scaled back its CapEx plans. We are forecasting higher orderlevels from the Logic segment in 2008, which will be driven by additionalinvestment in leading-edge technology by one of our MPU logic customers.  To summarize, I'd like to notehere that although in the short-term we are experiencing the somewhat choppyorder market with some uncertainty as to the timing of some large projects, ourlong-term pipeline remains strong.  Next, I'd like to discuss somerecent highlights for KLA-Tencor on our four strategic objectives: our customerfocus, growth, operational excellence and talent development. Customer focus isthe first of our four strategic objectives at KLA-Tencor. We work hard tounderstand our customers' requirements and to provide solutions in all themarkets that we serve. Our measure of success is our market share, and our goalis to have market leadership in all the markets that we serve.  Today, we have market leadingpositions in 18 of 20 of the markets that we serve, and our key to success isto collaborate closely with our customers, innovate to bring creativedifferentiated solutions and then execute and bringing the new products tomarket and support them through their product life.  In the September quarter, we weresuccessful in maintaining our market share in the markets where we have alreadyestablished the leadership position. In addition to that, we will able to gainshare in one significant market, where we currently do not enjoy marketleadership e-beam review.  Our new electron-beam review andclassification tool, the eDR-5200, was recently declared the tool of record forthe 45-nanometer node at a European logic facility. The eDR-5200 is an e-beamreview solution that also enhances resolution, thus improving the productivityof our inspectors.  Our customers needed todramatically reduce their SEM Non-Visual rates and improve performance ofdefect detection on 65-nanometer and 45-nanometer technology nodes. ATE'seDR-5200 solution provide a connectivity with inspectors to improve brightfieldrecipes or also delivering very high resolution in stage accuracy, allowingmaximum capture of defects on the review system.  Another eDR-5200 was installed ata key U.S.development center to enable advanced process development after 32-nanometernode. Competing eDR solution cannot resolve the smallest defects at the32-nanometer node. We believe the eDR-500 provides a great solution andpositions us for growth in this new market.  Now, I'll spend a few minutesgoing to our core markets of inspection of metrology. We have a broad portfolioof inspection products servicing the bare wafer Reticle manufacturers as wellas the semiconductor market, included in this are the Surfscan, brightfield,darkfield, E-Beam inspection and our Reticle Inspection products.  Our market share performanceremained at historical levels in all the key markets and product lines that wehave, as in the past there was always a lot of hard work required to win thebusiness especially in environment when capital is tight and our customers haveto make sure that the premiums that we get on our products are worth theadditional investment.  As in the past our teams did agood job of demonstrating our value and we are pleased with our market shareperformance across our inspection products. Let me give a couple of specificexamples.  Our 2810 full-spectrumbrightfield tool introduced in July 2007 and designed specifically for memoryapplications on large capacity expansion order with a Taiwanese memorymanufacturer in the September quarter, demonstrating superior sensitivity,capture of key defect signatures and throughput and head-to-head competition.  The 2810 features twice thecomputing speed of our earlier generation brightfield inspection tool, as wellas new optical merge that enables increase defect detection. The latestaddition to our Puma darkfield inspection platform, the Puma 9150, was chosenby logic customer to help it achieve improved device quality and zero effectproduct liability for specialized applications.  After a rigorous six-monthevaluation against the competing products, KT received orders for a delivery ofmultiple Puma 9150 units. The Puma 9150 demonstrated superior throughputstability and reliability of the production proven systems against thecompetition.  In Metrology, KLA-Tencorcontinues to be the market share leader, by offering a comprehensive suite ofmetrology analysis to process window optimization products, to give ourcustomers the ability to maintain tight control of their process windows.  In the September quarter, we weresuccessful in winning new business and displacing several competitors' tools,by demonstrating superior performance in optical CD films overlaying metrologyfor advanced applications in memory, foundry and logic customers.  Overall, our market share in theSeptember quarter met our expectations, with regard to the maintaining ourleadership positions in our core markets, in addition to picking up some nicegains in the e-beam review market.  In addition to that, we are wellpositioned going forward, based upon our product pipeline fueled by our R&Dinvestments across our portfolio. These are just a few examples of recentsuccesses. KLA-Tencor achieved during the September quarter and solving theircustomers' mission critical production challenges and expanding our marketleadership.  Across the industry the technicalchallenges our customers are facing are significant and we're working closelywith them to solve those problems.  Our second strategic objective atKLA-Tencor is growth. Our goal is to continue to outgrow the industry. Ourgrowth prospects continue to look good based upon the market segments that weserve and increasing the need for inspection measurement as device makersaddress the increase challenges of next design-rules. The increased complexityour customers are facing, as they transition to the 45 nanometer node, whetherintroducing new manufacturing techniques such as Immersion lithography, doublepatterning, pitch splitting, or integrating new materials to improve deviceperformance such high-k/metal-gate is creating new yield and defectivelychallenges driving the need for more accurate inspection and measurementtechnology. This is helping to drive accelerated adoption of process controls,and in turn new revenue opportunities for KLA-Tencor.  We estimate the increasedadoption of process control by chip manufactures of 45 nanometers translates toan incremental revenue opportunity for KLA-Tencor of 30% or more as comparedwith the 65 nanometer node. We see evidence of that growth potential in ourprojections for the calendar year '07 performance for KLA-Tencor relative tooverall CapEx market.  Based upon our current estimatesKLA-Tencor will outgrow the market in calendar '07 as we’ll grow revenue in therange of 15% to 20% compared with an industry CapEx growth rate of around 5%.It looks very hard to predict calendar '08. We believe we are well-positionedto continue to outgrow the industry as a result of the increased challenges of45 nanometers and based upon new markets that we have entered during calendar'07.  During calendar '07 we haveentered six new markets, both organically and through M&A activity whichincreases our potential available market by more than $700 million as sized byindustry analysts.  That being said, we are veryselective about the growth prospects that we pursue. We will only enter amarket that presents growth prospects that will enable profitable growth. Whilewe are willing to be patient we have to make sure that we can differentiate andadd value and grow in each market that we enter.  In addition to the six newmarkets that we entered during calendar '07, we have more growth initiatives inplace at KLA-Tencor and we will be providing updates as they materialize. Ourstrategy will be to continue our organic efforts as well as leveraging ourability to successfully use acquisitions as a way to enter new markets.  Our third strategic objective atKLA-Tencor is operational excellence. Over a year ago we laid out a four yearplan to drive continued improvement in our business model by drivingoperational excellence throughout the company. We have made steady progress onour plans and have seen the results of our efforts. During his preparedremarks, Jeff will go thorough the details of our progress.  Our fourth objective atKLA-Tencor is talent development. None of the success that KLA-Tencor enjoyswould be possible without our world class workforce. While historically we havedeveloped world class talent and achieved outstanding financial results throughthe cycles of the industry, we are increasing our efforts in talent developmentas we know that our people are the key to our success.  In summary, KLA-Tencor continuesto be a company with an unparalleled portfolio of inspection measurementtechnologies. During relationships with every major IC manufacturers and greatpeople who are driven by an unwavering passion for innovation and commitment toensure our success. These unique attributes are what have sparked our marketleadership over the past 31 years and what fuels our strong financialperformance, providing the resources for continued innovation and a strongfoundation for growth. We believe these attributes help to position KLA-Tencorto continue to outgrow the industry in 2008 and beyond.  I would like to wrap up mycomments now by giving you our guidance for the December quarter. Orders areexpected to be up 20% plus or minus 10% from the September quarter. Revenuesare expected to be between $625 million and $640 million and EPS in the rangeof $0.68 to $0.73 including stock based compensation and excluding one timecharges.  Thank you for your attention thisafternoon. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Hall. 
Jeff Hall: Thanks, Rick. As Rick said,KLA-Tencor had a solid operational execution in the September quarter, asshipments, revenue and EPS all came in at or above guidance. Operating marginwas also above expectations as some of the operational improvements we havebeen making began to show off, despite the drag of recent acquisitions and costof transitions to Singapore.Cash from operations was $205 million.  We also ramp production of oursecond product in Singaporeand made significant progress towards integrating our recent acquisitions. Ourgoal with these transitions is to get them seamlessly integrated with the restof KLA-Tencor and began recognizing the synergy as quickly as possible.  This means converting systems andprocesses, engineering products on the common platform, taking pre-acquisitions,bookings and commitments to the P&L, consolidating distributors, sales andservice efforts into our channels, and of course eliminating a lot of duplicateactivities. It takes a considerable amount of effort and expense to executethese integration efforts while continuing to serve our customers well.  In the September quarter, theseactivities were approximately 1.6 points, diluted to gross margin and 2.4 pointor approximately $15 million dilutive to operating margins. We expect thisdilution to be reduced in the December quarter and eliminated by the end of theMarch quarter. Overall, our integration efforts are continuing to meet ourexpectations and we are on-track to achieve our margin improvement target.  Now let me spend a minute goingthrough the quarter in more detail. September is always a challenging bookingsquarter for us, as it is our first fiscal quarter. In the last few weeks ofthis quarter timing of some orders for logic and DRAM customers became lessclear and some orders moved into the next calendar year. In the final few daysof the quarter, we were unable to agree on final terms for the few customers,and as a result didn't close on these orders by September 30. We did close onthese orders in early October.  While we expected some weaknessin memory in the second half, it turned out to be more widespread than weanticipated as end markets were foundry, logic, reticle and bare wafer were allimpacted. As a result of this, we now don't expect to close on the commercialterms of several orders until early 2008.  Net bookings for the quarter were$482 million, which is roughly 32% lower than the June ending quarter. This netbookings number includes $32 million of de-bookings. Every quarter, we closeour bookings backlog line-by-line and de-book any order we do not expect toshift in the next 12 months.  The product distribution oforders for wafer inspection was approximately 40, reticle inspection wasapproximately 13%, metrology was 23% and service was 24%.  We ended the quarter withapproximately $1.3 billion of backlogs, $835 million of shipment backlog ororders that have not yet shipped and $485 million of revenue backlog orproducts that have been shipped but have not yet been signed off by customers.  Remember, we do not include anyservice bookings or revenue in this backlog. We remain confident that we havestrong backlog shippable over the next six to nine months, and our ability tomaintain this significant level of both shipments and revenue backlog continuesto help KLA-Tencor sustain profitability throughout any business cycle.  Now turning to the incomestatement; revenue for the quarter was $693 million, down about 6% comparedwith the previous quarter. At the midpoint of our guidance for the Decemberquarter, we expect revenue growth for calendar year to be approximately 17%compared to about 10% for total process control and about 6% for wafer fabequipment.  We attribute this out-performanceto new products and increasing adoption of process control as the industrymoves to 45-nanometer design rules and below.  Gross margin for the quarter was55.9%. This includes $10.7 million of charges for deal-related amortization andreductions in force. Excluding these items, gross margin including stockoptions was 57.4%, down about 1.8 point from Q4.  Our recent acquisitions for 1.6point dilutive to margin, as we took several pre-acquisition commitments to theP&L and continue to consolidate and integrate the manufacturing operations. Operating expenses, including bothSG&A and R&D were $210 million. This number includes $6 million ofcharges for deal-related amortization, reduction in force and legal feesrelated to the stock-options investigations.  Excluding these items, operatingexpenses were $204 million, down $8 million quarter-to-quarter, as we continueto focus on driving down the breakeven point of the company. Breaking downoperating expenses, R&D expenses were flat quarter-to-quarter, as wecontinue to ramp development programs and customer collaborations at 45nanometers and below. And SG&A expenses were down approximately $8 millionquarter-to-quarter despite the addition of cost in the first four quarter of'08.  As a result of our continuingefforts to stream line the business and reduce the breakeven points, we expectthe operating expenses in the December quarter to be down another $8 million asa result of lower SG&A spending to approximately $196 million slightlybelow the levels of operating expense we had before the addition of over $25million of quarterly expenses from the recent acquisitions.  Operating margins for the quarterexcluding one-time charges were 28%, down 2.4 points from the prior quarter.This decline was a result of the integration of the recent acquisitions. Weexpect the margin pressure of these acquisitions to be reduced in December andexpect them to be at company average margins in the March quarter.  For the quarter, other income was$17.5 million. In the December quarter, we expect other income to beapproximately $14 million. The tax rate was 57.4% in the quarter. This rate washigher than our estimate of 28% as a result of an upfront tax payment relatedto the Singaporetransition.  In addition to the cost savingsexpected as part of our ongoing globalization strategy, we also expectsignificant tax savings. In order to maximize these savings, we moved therelated intellectual property to a non-US legal entity, resulting in a one-timetax expense of $47 million.  In the December quarter, weexpect the tax rate of approximately 28%. Net income for the quarter was $88.2million or $0.46 per fully diluted share. Excluding the charges discussedearlier, net income was $146 million or $0.76 per fully diluted share.  This number includes theshare-based compensation expenses of $28 million or $0.10 per diluted share. Inthe December quarter, we expect expenses for share-based compensation to beapproximately the same.  Turning to the balance sheet;cash and investments end of the quarter were 1.3 billion, a decrease of $428 millionquarter-to-quarter. In the quarter, we spent $683 million to repurchaseapproximately 12 million shares and paid a dividend of $28 million. After theseshare repurchases approximately 11 million shares remain authorized forrepurchase under our existing program. Inventory decreased by $35 million to$500 million. Accounts receivables finished the quarter at $619 million up $37million from the prior quarter as a result of higher shipment levels andincreased sales to Japan.Cash from operations was $205 million in the quarter and capital expenditureswere approximately $11.6 million while depreciation was $14.6 million. So, on anet basis including retirement fixed assets decreased by $3 millionquarter-over-quarter. Fully diluted shares ended the quarter at $193 millionand headcount was about 6000.  Finally, as Rick commentedearlier, we were in a choppy CapEx environment and so we continue to run ourcompany in a way that will allow us to maintain high levels of investment innext generation technology and in collaborations with our customers, whilemaintaining our high levels of profitability and cash flow. With that ourguidance for the quarter is bookings up 20% plus or minus 10 points. Revenuebetween $625 million and $640 million. Operating expenses down an additional $8million to approximately $196 million and EPS including share basedcompensation but excluding one time charges and amortization of $0.68 to $0.73. This concludes our remarks on thequarter. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call overto Marvin to give the polling instructions, let me request that you refrainfrom asking multipart questions to give others some time. As always, we are allon a tight schedule. Marvin can you begin the polling please. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Ourfirst question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with Morgan Stanley.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Good afternoon. Yieldissues are clearly a pressure point for the industry here as you know clearlyguys struggling on 50 nanometer NAND, we’ve got the foundry sort of strugglingwith 65 nanometers. I know that there are some people today concerned aboutTSMC's comments about CapEx being down next year. Take all of these into account,I would assume though that even in a down CapEx environment, for foundries, andeven for memory, that the spend for KLA solutions will be up. Is that a fairassumption?
Jeff Hall: Yeah, Harlan, I think it’s a goodpoint. Obviously we are seeing various concerns from different customers abouttheir yield challenges and that's actually heighten recently. John and I wereboth in Asia last week meeting with customersand an increased level of interest particularly in driving the latesttechnologies forward, so as we look forward we see process control continuingto out perform the overall industry. However, its hard to say when we get intoa calendar '08 what it will overall look like, but we think we are going to outperform as a result of the challenges associated with the advance nodes andboth the logic and DRAM and also the foundries basis.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great and then given thesort of large revision down in bookings in September from your expectationsentering the quarter, I am just wondering what your confidence level is here inthe December quarter about delivering on the up 20% in orders? 
John Kispert: Hey, Harlan, this is JohnKispert. One of the things that happened in the September quarter is we saw agood chunk of the originally forecasted orders kind of move into the first weekof October. So we are fortunate in the guidance that we just gave you for theDecember quarter, we are up to real fast start in that we already have a bunchof that already booked. So the linearity of the quarter will be far differentas far as the order outlook and then say the September quarter was?
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Got it. And then one lastquestion for Jeff, what do you expect shipments to be like here in the Decemberquarter?
Jeff Hall: Right now we are running at about575 to 600.
Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Hi, good afternoon. A couple ofitems, I am wondering if you can talk about, if the environment stage is sortof flattish like this, let's say the orders bounced back up after the big dropoff, but generally sort of staying in this range. Can you give us some moreinside now that you are moving the second product line into Asiaabout what kind of margin we should see over the next couple of quarters if youare in sort of a flattish revenue and shipping environment? And what kind ofexpansion we can see?
John Kispert: Hi Brett, it's John Kispert. Ithink the way to think about it for us right now given our backlog position,what we see on front of us is if you average over the last couple of quarters,we kind of have been running about $700 million with lots of ups and downs. Itsalways a chunky business, but roughly $700 million run-rate for the company.Right now it looks to us kind of run-rate for the next couple of quarterscloser to 625 or so. There will be some quarters, where we ship a little bitless and some quarters we ship a little bit more, but we'll manage throughthat. That's kind of our bottoms up analysis of that.  Now, the delayer in Singapore,which is as we've told you in the past is kind of that 5% of its capacity rightnow, and is relatively large overhang of excess capacity for us. They areramping very nicely I would think coming out of this quarter to the Decemberearning quarter, we are closer to maybe 25%, 30% of their capacity, but stillonly about 5% to 10% of our shipments. But we will begin to absorb more andmore of that overhead. And that will add at that 600, 625 run rate for us abouta point of gross margin which should be helpful.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Okay. So, just to be clear thatthat's a point of gross margin in the coming quarter over the next fewquarters, does that 625 the standard run rate?
Rick Wallace: Yeah, over the next few quarter,take a couple of quarters to get Singapore ramped up and also a fast start butthe plan was over the next three to four quarters just start to see it ramp.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Got it. Very good thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon guys. Thanks somuch. My question, just I'll keep with the one question is, when I think backto semicon watch and what the application was for orders at that time for thesecond half for the year versus -- total second half versus what we are lookingat today? What do you think it is innutshell changed the most and then why do you think that you have a handle onsome of the environments going forward, given the delta between than and now?How do you get comfortable your view on the environment over the next couple ofquarters is good given all the CapEx forecast declines that we're getting fromthe customers right now?
John Kispert: Yeah, Jim, it's John Kispert,COO. You are talking back to July, I guess.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Yeah. At some time, I think youguys add as much more optimistic outlook scenario for the total second half forthe year at that time.
John Kispert: Yeah. As Rick said in hisprepared statements that I'd say the big change has been really over the last30 days. And it came kind of in two flavors at least my perception of it. Inthe last 30 days, we've seen the larger capacity adds that have been plannedover the next six to nine months become smaller. I mean in another ways, youare going to still add some capacity to the smaller chunks or smaller bites inour case smaller orders. That happen about 30 days ago and as you would imagebecause it's built out 50% of our businesses, it's now a little bit more andmost of it's in memory. And I think the other piece thathappened, kind of, in the last couple of weeks is definitely a movement out ofsome of the capacity like ads, where folks would plan on purchasing stuff maybein the December ending quarter and strongly then ramping in March timeframe andnow taking more like the late spring summertime. And so you see this kind ofmoment out or to the right as we say. When you combine those twotogether for us and I think you guys will do all the math here, it was kind ofmoment of maybe a half a quarter of orders and our run rate back then, it'skind of moved out into 2008. And, as Jeff said, our position is as usual, we'regoing to be very cautious from here on in. And we're running the business thatway. The Brett's earlier question was sizing the company, low 600s right nowfor next couple of quarters. And we'll wait and see. And as you know, we workclosely with our customer so we'll be on top of it.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
John Kispert: Jim, have a good weekend.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Jeff Hall: Satya, are you there?
Vis Vellore- Credit Suisse: Yeah. Hi. This is [Vis Vellore]on behalf of Satya Kumar.
Jeff Hall: Okay. How are you?
Vis Vellore- Credit Suisse: Yeah, doing good. One quickquestion, so now that like a major foundry talked about slowing spending in2008. So what is your outlook for CapEx for 2008 and just want to get yourthoughts on why foundry should be slow, it would be lowered in CapEx whenutilization rates are so high?
Jeff Hall: Yeah, it's a confusing time. Whenwe look at the forecast from folks like yourself and lots of other folkslistening in where we see there is a wide range of 2008 CapEx being anywherefrom flat to down 15%. We tend to look at it on the lower half when we do anykind of bottoms-up conversations with our customers. So we take again to the earlierquestions, we are taking a cautious stance there. The drivers underneath thatare certainly fall off in DRAM spending. I think NAND will continue to bestronger. I think when we look at the foundry business, the timing of any sortof capacity as in foundry I think of very much in question right now. We see alot of technical upgrading that we can do in the foundry businesses. But it's asmaller piece of the entire pie. So it's either going to be flat,maybe slightly down. And as Rick said earlier, we think we can do well on thatspace. It's just that we don't see a lot of spending today through 2008, a biguptake in other words. And that leaves Logic which to us right now looks to bedown on 2008 as far as CapEx is concerned. We think we cannot perform there andgiven the 45-nanometer challenges and the things that we can do there. Soprobably we at KLA-Tencor will be flat to up in Logic, but the industry trendlooks like it's always probably down.
Vis Vellore- Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Timothy Arcuri with Citi.
Timothy Arcuri - Citi: Hi guys. Couple of things: Firstof all, John if you look at the bookings in the second half of the year versusthe first half of the year. As you compare that to some of the other OEMs, it'sin the [growth of] the suppliers and most of the other OEMs are down about 15%half-over-half and you are down like 2x of that. I mean there is obviously differencesin timing of your tools versus their tools, but what do you think the reasonis? Is it specific customers where you have big exposure that are cutting backor is it maybe that people kind of over bought inspection equipment early on,what do you think the dealt is there?
Jeff Hall: Yeah, Tim, that's news to me, butI'll tell you that we have like nine months lead times generally across ourproduct line, I think the folk you are comparing us to probably much shorterlead times. In fact I know they do, but I deal with this continuously with ourcustomer base. So, our lead time in our orders tend to be further out in timeas far as been able to install and turn into capacity.
Timothy Arcuri - Citi: Sure, okay. Well, I understand.So then John I guess last question, it looks like shipments were about 710 inSeptember is that about right?
John Kispert: Yeah, about 700.
Timothy Arcuri - Citi: 700, okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of CJ Muse with Lehman Brothers.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Yeah, good afternoon, thank youfor taking my call, quick question here. If you look at the dealt of yourbookings guide at the midpoint or I guess the lower end and then the actuallydown 32%, so just roughly I guess $100 million being pushed to December whichwould suggest pulling that out at roughly $500 million bookings run-rate, whichcompares to kind of mid 600 revenue guide. How should we think about thismismatch and the implications to your revenues in the quarters ahead? 
Jeff Hall: Yeah, CJ, there was a priorquestion on that and I tried to answer that question. We have a bunch ofbacklog that will tapers in and I also think in as we said in the guidance ourorders are going to be up in December. 
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: I guess, that was going to leadmy second question, just its seems like two months ago, you guys were talking alot more bullishly about foundry and logic spending and now pulling back there,what gives you the confidence that your backlog is secured today?
Rick Wallace: Our backlog is generallytechnology buys for the work that they are doing in pilot lines strategic. Weactively beat the books CJ where we don't think were there were capacity buysthat we think are in danger is not actually happening. We are focused with ourbacklog and keeping it in the strategic aims of our customers and we will meetthe tools, so they can push their business in line. 
Jeff Hall: I think if you look at our trackrecord rarely do you see we have to de-book a large part of our backlog in anykind of the environment.
CJ Muse - Lehman Brothers: Sounds good. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Mark Fitzgerald with Banc of America.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Rick, in the delay in some ofthese bookings and stuff that’s going to push down to the first calendarquarter here when you have these conversations with your customers are theywaiting to see how market conditions unfold is that what this issue that sayingin this company, these orders are?
Rick Wallace:  Well I think there was a coupleof issues: One is a lot of them based their investment plans based on overallmarket conditions and as those are soft and I think people will slowdown someof those overall. And I think we saw early signs of some of the recentannouncement that have been made. We saw that at the end of September thethings that have just been made in the last few days. And so I think they are gettingdown, they have reset their base line about what do they think they need toinvest. As counter balancing that is concerned that they don't want to getbehind in particularly our new technologies and so that's where we see a lotof, why we have more confidence as John was saying in our backlog and then someof these orders coming in. So John also said they tend to overall get a littlebit smaller and they get a little bit further out.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: And just a follow on here is, Imean dealing on price approach and lot of peoples cash cost is that an issue interms of any these orders get pushed out that in terms of your conversation?
Rick Wallace:  Certainly, that’s part of thefactor into. But as, you know, for many of these customers if they want to stayin the market they have to keep investing and so that’s a counter balance forthat. Now you can make a pretty good case, but over the next 12 months, theremight not be as many players 12 months from now as there are right now. And,we’ll wait that’s why John was saying, we think from overall market for '08we’re probably more cautions than last.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: And just one final question if Imight: On the logic side of the business, when you look post 2000 you reallyhaven’t seen this part of the business coming back in a big way? And I amcurious if these technology notes ships on the logic side of the business arejust slowing down from your guys manage point?
John Kispert: Yeah. I think the ramping of themhas Mark, that this big spending to your point, but as you know we’reconstantly collaborating with them on next generation technologies and so fromthat manage point we don’t feel like it slowed down at all.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America:  Well, you look at that is kind ofover a long-term still a growth business were you in the logic part of it? 
John Kispert: Yes, sure, not like it has beenin the past but certainly, great opportunities particularly with our nextgeneration technology. I mean that’s where we can get a lot of learning earlyon as they move forward with their next-gen. We have our entire suite of toolsthat has to be coupled with them.
Rick Wallace:  I think some of what happen iswell Mark, is some of that logic overtime is turning to foundry standard andsome of these guys have stopped making some of their own devices.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: But foundry spending, thatlooking great item for 2000 year.
Rick Wallace: Post 2000.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: I mean as you look at the -- yourrecovery post 2000 are all memory driven at this point though.
Rick Wallace: From an overall industry there isno question that NAND, for example, you can even get more specific and lot ofit has been about NAND, NAND investment and DRAM has been a little morecyclical and now we’re seeing some correction in NAND. Those, I think that’strue, I think for us that we still see our penetration in the logic and in thefoundries being pretty strong relative to overall CapEx, now whether theoverall CapEx is at the similar levels to what it has been historically, Ithink that maybe more of the point. The big CapEx spend is to be memory now.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Bin Pang with Caris Company.
Bin Pang - Caris Company: Thanks for taking my question. Ijust want to get a clarification on a couple of your comments regarding 2008spending. You mentioned for logic you expect the industry to be down but KLAsor spending on PDC will be flat to up. Correct?
John Kispert:  I think flat that will be theright way to term it.
Bin Pang - Caris Company: Okay. When you talk about logicare you including foundry in that?
John Kispert: No. 
Bin Pang - Caris Company: Okay. So that’s IDM spending.
John Kispert:  Yes.
Bin Pang - Caris Company: And your comments regarding thefoundry itself, could you, just repeat that again, you still expect PDC to beup for foundry in 2008.
Jeff Hall:  No. I think and by the way 2008we’re rarely right in predicting this. And we are just talking to a lot of folksand trying to anticipate how we should size the company to anticipate thesequestions. Right now foundry does look like it’s up marginally year-to-year,and that’s based on the plans we’re getting from our foundry customers. But asyou know it’s a -- and we typically are well adopted in the foundry model. So,we would expect to do well there. But foundry as a percentage of the total piefor CapEx is as today is a smaller percentage but we would expect it to behigher in 2008.
Bin Pang - Caris Company: Okay, and the last question forme regarding memory spending. You commented that your orders for the 1Q weredown because it primarily was memory driven, is that correct?
Jeff Hall: Yes.
Bin Pang - Caris Company: And when those companies comeback in the 2Q, is that on the technology or is it capacity?
Jeff Hall: A little bit of both. Primarilywhat you see moving on is capacity. We talk about memory often it is the samething than as you know. They will be pushing the envelope and adding capacityat the next technology node. So to answer your question, I would say it's aprobably 50:50.
Bin Pang - Caris Company: Okay. Thank you very much.
Jeff Hall: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Garry Hsueh with CIBC World Markets.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Thanks for taking my question. IfI take the low end of the range for September and I take the midpoint of yourorder guidance for December. It looks like you are basically missing $75million out of orders post in the second half. So my question is, basically, isthere a reasonable expectation for orders in the first half of '08 now tosomehow get to a $650 million to $700 million per quarter run-rate or has that$75 million just permanently flew the coup?
John Kispert: No, right now it definitelysitting in Q1, Gary.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. So John, I mean there is apossibility here we could start to book somewhere between $650 million to $700million per quarter here in March?
John Kispert: I think our bottoms-up would putus somewhere down there right now.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, so we didn't permanentlylose that business?
John Kispert: No, there is no share loss here.In fact, we did really well with share.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, so we've got a pretty nicerunning start here in March on the order basis and we have got pretty strongbacklog.
John Kispert: As looks today, it's moving, it'svery fluid environment we are operating in.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, I appreciate the honesty.And can you just give me a quick comment here on pricing? I know there is a lotof concern about DRAM and how that might be transferring over to tool pricing?
John Kispert: Oh, I don't price DRAMs. Ourprice is hanging in their really well. The next-generation tools have donereally well with cost of ownership, sensitivity improvements, for ever battlingpricing and trying to come up with the lowest cost of ownership with ourcustomers. But the technology needs are such I think it's a fair battle. So ourpricing is no change say the rest of this year has been.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, John, can sneak one morequestion for Jeff, here?
John Kispert: Absolutely.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Jeff, what's going on here withunearned revenue, I see that for the first time, there is a slog of unearnedrevenue now moving to the long-term liability line, is there anything going onthere?
Jeff Hall: Yeah, there is actually nothinggoing on, what happened is we implemented what's called FIN 48 a new accountingrule in the quarter, first quarter of the new year for us and as we did that,it changed how we bucketed some of our tax line and we bucketed, that resultedin us having some, taking some short-term tax liabilities and moving them tolong-term tax liabilities. Previously, the unearned revenue had all been rolledup in the short-term, but when we created the long-term liabilities section ofour balance sheet, we then move the unearned revenue from short-term to long-term.
Garry Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay, perfect. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Steven Pelayo with HSBC.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: John, this is like the second orthird quarter, I think our bookings are little bit of a surprise, KLA hasstarted with them pretty good forecasting especially in the technology focus,nine months lead times and bookings guidance with the plus or minus 10% band.Is there any kind of secular change going on as a consist with reliability orforecast ability kind of deteriorated, what should I be thinking especiallygiven your comment, I guess you just suggested that [by the time] you arelooking at first quarter bookings to potential be up again from the 600 levelmaybe 650 to 700ish.
John Kispert: For the first half, I think itjust a math it is bottoms-up but definitely looks that way to us and the firstpart, I'm scratching my head Steve, I don't know that we've particularly beatthe order guidance a number of quarters in a row and as you know we follow thecompany for a long time and the September quarter is typically a more difficultquarter and hopefully I have characterized pretty well for you was backendloaded with generally memory orders that either slid out of the Septemberquarter into the December quarter and we closed those. But I think since thenwhat you've seen across the industry is folks really looking at their plans andkind of moving around at the beginning of 2008 when they are going to startadding something and that's what we are in the midst of right now and we aregiving you our best view of what we have right now.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: You are doing good on the costside, John. You just talked about OpEx being down again in December, if you dostate the revenue run-rate of 625 range, can OpEx had even lower?
John Kispert: The plan is for R&D to keepchugging along here, particularly with our -- what we call n plus two kind oftwo generations out, we are going to keep plenty of opportunities. Rickhighlighted a bunch of in his prepared remarks. I think SG&A, there wasroom for us to continuously consolidate something. So at around $600 million,$625 million run-rate, we think an operating profit line, we can be at high 20sas a percent 28%, 29%, 27% and that's how we think we can run in at that level.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: And Jeff at that level are yousustaining the kind of 30% of revenue in cash flow from operations? That lookspretty good.
Jeff Hall: Yes, absolutely. I think whatyou'll see is that if things level out, cash flow actually goes up. We had astrong cash flow this quarter, buffer some big tax payments. Next quarter,we're going to have another really big cash flow quarter, next quarter. Sowe're now starting to work down the working capital.
Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Hey, guys thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you. Quick question on thewafer market, I know you guys did really well this year. Can you talk aboutlittle bit what's the size of the wafer market and how does that look in 2008?
Rick Wallace: Hi, Mahesh, it's Rick. As youknow, we don't break out the market segments, you're right we've done well inwafer. I think that overall demand for 300-nanometer had been building. But wecertainly see that there just like everything else I think probably a softeningenvironment overall for wafer manufacturers as well in terms of additionalspend on CapEx. But that being said, we are wellpositioned within them, and we have some new products in the pipeline to beable to do better than the overall CapEx, based on our ability to bring out newtechnologies and new tools which will drive some ASP growth.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then a quick questionfor Jeff, does that amortization of intangibles does that go mostly in COGS orthey're distributed along all three lines?
Jeff Hall: The way it works in anacquisition is typically the first couple of quarters, it's heavier in COGS andthat's start to go down as we realize the revenue on some of the tools and thenthe tail is in SG&A.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, so should we put that mostof $12 million or whatever you said?
Jeff Hall: Yes, the bulk of that is in SG&Agoing forward.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. All right. Thank you verymuch.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of Suresh Balaraman with ThinkEquity.
Suresh Balaraman - ThinkEquity: Thanks. Regarding Japan,whether any specific product groups say a reticle inspection or CD SEM thatdrove the orders or it is just normal lumpiness. The 20 percentage point abovehistorical is unusual, isn't it?
Jeff Hall: It is above normal andunfortunately it was based on the fact that we have more softness in the otherregions. So the percentage goes up, you might imagine. Its panel doing therepretty well, most of our softness was in other regions and so as a percent itgoes up. Does that make sense?
Suresh Balaraman - ThinkEquity: Okay. And also can you breakoutthe thing that you usually do DRM foundries, NAND flash as the percentage ofDRAM, do they missed up data?
Jeff Hall: (inaudible).
Suresh Balaraman – ThinkEquity: You guys used to give breakdownof DRAM, NAND flash foundries and Logic?
Jeff Hall: For the September quarter?
Suresh Balaraman – ThinkEquity: Yeah.
Jeff Hall: Yeah. So for the Septemberquarter, memory was about 55% of the total, about half of that was NAND, logicwas 25 and foundry was 20.
Suresh Balaraman – ThinkEquity: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from theline of David Egan with Lehman Brothers.
David Egan - Lehman Brothers: Hi, guys. See you already got it.
Rick Wallace: I think we are out of timeanyway. I would like to thank you all for participating in our conference calltoday. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.

Operator: I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor fourth quarter fiscal 2007 earning conference call. (Operator Instructions) Now I would like to introduce Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, Mr. Hall. You may begin your conference. 
 Jeff Hall: Good afternoon and welcome to KLA-Tencor fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. I am Jeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our CEO; and John Kispert, our President and COO.  We are here today to discuss the fourth quarter results for the period ending June 30, 2007.

With that, I will turn it over to Rick. 
 Rick Wallace:  Thank you, Jeff and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter fiscal year 2007 quarterly conference call. Today, I will review highlights of our performance in FY'07 and for the June quarter as well as provide guidance for the September quarter. Fiscal 07 was a good year for KLA-Tencor, the result of strong demand in our end markets and solid execution by the entire KLA-Tencor team. Revenue grew 32% to $2.7 billion in fiscal '07. Net income including share-based compensation but excluding one-time and deal-related charges was $633 million or $3.13 per diluted share in fiscal 2007.  Cash flow was also strong in fiscal 2007. We generated approximately $611 million and operating cash flow in the year. Over the 12 months ending in June, we repurchased over $800 million in common stock and paid out cash dividends of approximately $95 million.  As most of you know, at KLA-Tencor we solve mission-critical production problems for our customers by delivering a portfolio of differentiated inspection metrology solutions. Our four strategic objectives are customer focus, revenue growth, operating excellence and talent development. I would like to provide some insight into each objective.  First of course is the focus on the customer. We work closely with our customers to help them solve mission critical production problems. Our objective is to have market leadership in each market that we serve. Today we have leading positions in 18 of our 20 markets and over the past two years we have seen share growth across our major markets. KLA-Tencor tools help our customers increase their ROI and keep pace with the increasingly more complex demands of advanced technology nodes.  Our second strategic objective is growth. Our goal is to outgrow the industry, and in FY07 we were able to meet that goal. With the challenges that our customers face at 45 nanometers and our product portfolio, we are well-positioned to continue to outgrow the industry.  Our third objective is to continuously improve our business model. Today we are driving many different initiatives worldwide to improve profitability through optimizing our global footprint and improving organizational efficiency. Of course, none of this is possible without the world-class talent within KLA-Tencor. We work very hard to attract, develop and retain an outstanding work force. We have been successful in building our team and I am especially proud of the performance of the entire KLA-Tencor team this year.  In summary, we are very pleased with our growth in revenue and profitability in fiscal 2007, an indication that our strategy to focus on inspection metrology is working and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. We will help our customers continue to tackle difficult yield issues as they adopt new technologies.  Turning our attention to the highlights of the June quarter results. Bookings for the June quarter were $708 million, about 3% higher than the March quarter in the upper end of guidance. Recent booking strength has been driven by increasing adoption of 45 nanometer technology and continued progression to the transition the 300 millimeters. 45-nanometer represented 28% of our incoming orders in June. Customers that are focused on next-generation technologies are beginning to invest in pilot lines and R&D efforts.  Regardless of geometry, customers are investing in order to improve yields and lower their costs under pressure to get to market quicker. This is a challenging problem for our customers, one that will be more difficult as customers transition to compete with newer technologies. Of course, KLA-Tencor plays a critical role in that process.  Turning now to the specifics underlying our strong bookings results in the June quarter. In June, we saw continued strength in wafer inspection as well as gains in our core metrology and medical businesses. Memory was approximately 50% of orders in Q4, NAND was 40% of memory and up marginally compared with the prior quarter. Foundry grew sequentially and was 35% of orders in the fourth quarter as foundries continued to build out their 65 nanometer capacity. Logic was 15% of orders. We are watching logic demands closely and see growth opportunities in 45 nanometer later in the year.  Revenue in the June quarter was $736 million, an increase of 3% compared with the prior quarter and up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Net income including stock-based compensation, but excluding certain one time charges and deal-related amortization in the fourth quarter was $177 million or $0.90 per share.  Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to discuss innovation, which is something that we do continuously at KLA-Tencor in order to differentiate and grow our market leadership. One of our core competencies at KLA-Tencor is new product development and introduction. This year as we continue to develop our 45 nanometer product suite, we are introducing a record number of new products, a tribute to the hard work of the KLA-Tencor team.  This high tempo of productivity has helped fuel our growth. In fact, 85% of new systems ordered in the fourth quarter were from new products we've announced in the last 12 months, so we continue to be very prolific in introducing new technologies to the market. I'd like to highlight some of the new products we introduced this quarter.  Two of these strengthen our position in core markets for KLA-Tencor, and the third, our new EBeam Review tool, not only complements our existing portfolio but also positions us well in a new market opportunity for KLA-Tencor.  We featured two new products in the Brightfield inspection family at SemiCON last week; the 2810 which is focused on memory customers and the 2815 which is targeted for logic customers. The 2800 product series is our DQV broadband wafer inspection system. We hold the leadership position in the wafer inspection market and these two new products should help extend our position even further, offering more flexibility, sensitivity and speed for our customers as they advance in new technologies. We have begun shipments of both the 2810 and 2815 products to customers investing in 45 nanometer development.  We feature the new Puma 9150 at SemiCON last week, the latest generation in our Darkfield product line, building on our position in the market place with higher throughput and higher sensitivity. Puma combines the high throughput characteristics of Darkfield inspection with the high sensitivity imaging necessary to capture defects on a small design.  A third new product announced at SemiCON last week, the EDR 5200 is one I am particularly excited about. The EDR 5200 is an EBeam Review solution that also enhances resolution, improving the productivity of our inspectors. Our customers are telling us as they go to 45 nanometers they're not satisfied with the resolution and other capabilities that existing review solutions are offering. We believe the EDR 5200 provides a great solution and positions us for growth in this new market.  A critical element to our continued success is our emphasis on delivering an outstanding customer experience and delivering superior customer service and best in breed technology, KLA-Tencor creates a significant competitive advantage that translates to strong market leadership, revenue growth and profitability.  Now, let me turn to our guidance for the September quarter. Our September outlook is a little complex this year, as we have a number of factors impacting our results, largely related to recent acquisitions. Jeff will give you more of the details. Given that, our bookings outlook for September is down 15%, with a range of plus or minus 10%. This is on par with the typical seasonality we experience in September.  Revenue in the September quarter is expected to be between $670 million and $690 million. EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share. Now to give you more details on the results, let me turn the call back over to Jeff. 
 Jeff Hall:  Thank you, Rick. Let me start by going through the quarter in more detail. Net bookings for the June ending quarter were $708 million which is roughly 3% higher than the March ending quarter and 11% lower than our quarterly results from one year ago. Every quarter, we review our backlog in detail and debook in accordance with our bookings policy that restrict actual bookings to a set criteria. The set criteria mandates that technical specifications are signed off, valid terms and conditions are finalized and delivery is scheduled within 12 months. This quarter, we debooked $23.3 million of orders.  We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of backlog for unshipped orders. Remember, we do not include any service bookings in the backlog number. In addition we have $468 million of deferred revenue related to products that have shipped, but not yet been signed off by customers. This is invoiced systems revenue deferred under SAB 104. It includes no service revenue and is made up of tools delivered but awaiting written acceptance from the customer. We remain confident that we have a strong backlog shippable over the next six to nine months. Our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain profitability throughout any business cycle.  The regional distribution of orders for the June quarter was as follows: the U.S. was 22%, lower than its historical average of 25%. Taiwan was 23%, higher than its historical average of 20%. Korea, China, Singapore combined were 22%, higher than their historical average of 20%. Europe was 7%, lower than its historical average of 10% and Japan was 26%, higher than its historical average of 25%.  The product distribution of orders was wafer inspection was 45%. Reticle inspection was 14%. Metrology was 25%. Data storage was 1%. Service was 15%.  Before we start with the income statement, let me summarize the special charges in the quarter. We had $37.9 million of pretax, non-cash charges related to acquisitions. The breakdown of these charges is $13.8 million is included in the cost of goods sold, $22.3 million is research and development, and $1.7 million is including in SG&A. In the September quarter, we expect $12.3 million of pretax non-cash charges related to acquisitions. We also incurred $10.8 million in pretax charges related to a reduction in force completed in April. $2.4 million is included in cost of goods sold, $2.3 million is included in R&D, and $6.1 million is included in SG&A.  Now, turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $736 million, up about 3% quarter to quarter, and up 27% from the same quarter last year. Revenue for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 was $2.7 billion, up 32% from fiscal year 2006. The recent acquisitions are making things a little lumpy for the June and September quarters. We have a lot of activities going on to get them integrated and to realize the synergies as quickly as possible.  This impacts revenues in two ways. First, in the June quarter, we were able to integrate some of the products into our sales channel faster than expected, and as a result recognized revenue and cost savings faster than previously expected, resulting in about $20 million of revenue being recognized in June instead of September.  Second, in the September quarter, we have several acquired products that we will recognize nearly zero revenue from as a result of converting them to our revenue recognition policy, which is more conservative.  GAAP gross margin was 57.1%. As discussed earlier, this includes $13.8 million of charges for acquisition and deal-related amortization and $2.4 million of charges for the April reduction in force. Excluding these items, gross margin was 59.3%, off about 50 basis points from Q3, as savings realized from our cost reduction initiatives was greater than transition costs related to our move to Singapore and the dissolution from recent acquisitions.  Operating expenses including both SG&A and R&D were $246 million. As discussed earlier, this number includes $24 million of charges for acquisitions and deal-related amortization and $8.4 million of charges for the reduction in force completed in April. Excluding these items, operating expenses were $213 million, up $7 million from the prior quarter as a result of the recent acquisitions.  As a result of our continuing efforts to reduce costs, we expect operating expenses in the September quarter to be down about 1% from June despite an increase of $8 million in operating expenses related to the acquisitions. Operating income for the quarter was 30.4%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. For the fiscal year, operating margin was 28.4% as our cost reduction efforts drove 63% incremental operating margins.  For the quarter, other income was $21.4 million and included a $4 million gain of our interest in Blue29. Going forward we will no longer have minority interest on our balance sheet or income statement.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7%. This rate was lower than the ongoing tax rate of 28%, as a result of the one time charge in the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $147.3 million or $0.75 per diluted share. Excluding the charges discussed earlier, net income was $177 million or $0.90 per fully diluted share. This number includes share-based compensation expenses of about $0.09 per diluted share and the approximate breakout is cost of goods sold $0.03; R&D, $0.04; SG&A, $0.06; and a tax benefit of $0.04.  In the September 2007 quarter we expected expense for share-based compensation to be approximately $0.10 per share. Net income for fiscal 2007 was $528 million or $2.61 per fully diluted share. Excluding the one-time charges, net income was $632 million, up 74% from fiscal 2006 and earnings per fully diluted share for the year were $3.13.  Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at $1.7 billion, an increase of $125 million quarter to quarter and a decrease of $615 million year on year. Inventory increased by $5 million to $535 million, as a result of the recent acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, inventory was down $45 million in the quarter.  Accounts receivables finished the quarter at $582 million, up $82 million from the prior quarter. $20 million of this increase was related to the acquisition. Capital additions related to fixed assets were approximately $29 million for the quarter as we completed the construction of our new facility in Asia. Depreciation was $15.4 million, and on a net basis including retirements, fixed assets increased by $815 million over the quarter.  Cash from operations was $153 million for the quarter and $611 million for the year. We paid a dividend of $23 million in the quarter. In the quarter, we also completed the accelerated share repurchase plan buying 14 million shares at an average price of $53.52. We also restarted our systematic buyback plan and bought back an additional 820,000 shares. Fully diluted shares outstanding ended the quarter at 197 million.  Headcount ended the June quarter at about 6,000 flat from March and up 100 from one year ago.  Finally, as Rick commented earlier, September is a bit of a complex quarter for us and we have a lot of both accounting and operational integration going on. Given that, our guidance for the quarter is: bookings down 15%, plus or minus 10%; revenue between $670 million and $690 million; operating expenses down about 1%; and EPS of $0.72 to $0.76.  This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call to questions. Before I turn the call over to Celeste to give the full instructions, let me request that you refrain from asking multi-part question to give others some time.  Celeste, can you begin the polling please? 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Nice job on the quarter. As it relates to your non-memory customers transitioning to the advanced technology nodes, although some of them may be holding flat or even cutting back on their CapEx here in 2007, is the spend at these customers actually going up due to the increase in inspection in metrology intensity at the sub 56 nanometer nodes? 
 Rick Wallace:  Hi, Harlan. Yes, great question. No, no question that we are seeing increase out of the non-memory guys and you alluded to the reasons. Just the challenges associated even with 65 and below are causing them to pursue both advanced inspection tools as well as the metrology tools to support their performance needs as they go there. So we are seeing increased demand there and working very closely with those customers for that. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: I think you've said before, you expected about a 30% increase in the dollar opportunity. As you are starting to engage with these customers, is that what you are finding the numbers to actually be? 
 Rick Wallace:  Yes, it definitely appears that way. As you know we really haven't seen 45 nanometers completely built out, but the indications we're getting in the development phase is certainly a lot of concern around the challenges associated and as a result people making incremental investment in both inspection and metrology to satisfy those needs. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch. 
 Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Rick, I am wondering, with the large number of new products that you're rolling out, and I know you never like to give us specifics on this, but could you talk to us a little bit about the profile? Are ASPs changing with the large number of rollouts in a meaningful way? Now that you have collapsed the number of product platforms you have, will this new product rollout be able to take advantage of that in terms of perhaps with more margin leverage than you've seen in the past? 
 Rick Wallace:  Hi, Brett, yes, good questions, both of those. I'll tell you what, I'll take the first part, then I will let John deal with the platform question. From an ASP standpoint, there's no question that as we bring out new tools our customers are pushing for more performance and that results in higher ASPs as we bring out the latest products and we are definitely seeing ASP growth as a result of the new technologies, for example the 2810 and 2815, that we talked about bringing out are of course higher ASPs as they're delivering more performance.  The platform side the story is pretty good as well, and I will let John talk to that. 
 John Kispert:  Brett, as you know we have been focusing on this for the last couple of years. Seems to me three or four years and it is getting much better now. The synergies that were seeing are not only in R&D and development, as we go from say 25 different platforms to a much smaller number. In R&D obviously, sharing there. But certainly in manufacturing and in the cost service and the maintenance because the learning curve for our install folks, our service folks, worldwide is much less steep. It allows us to do things quicker and be much more flexible across our entire portfolio of KLA-Tencor products.  I think our challenge recently has been with some of the acquisitions. How quickly can we extrapolate this commonality, the quest for more and more commonality across that acquisitions and that is something we are really focused on right now. If there has been a speed bump, it's been there. We see great opportunities with the newer platforms to incorporate those into what we have today. Does that make sense? 
 Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch:  Makes sense, thanks. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri - Citigroup. 
 Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: John, can you give us some sense of what shipments were in June and what you think you will ship in September? And also what of that portion do you will be from [inaudible]? Thanks. 
 Jeff Hall: Shipments in the June quarter were 693, shipments in the September quarter are going to be 690 and we're not going to break out the acquisitions, but it is deminimus. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: You are going to book maybe 590, round numbers, you're shipping 690, 680. What would have to happen in order for your revenues to equal the bookings level you're going to see in September? What kind of environment would you have to see over the next couple of quarters in order for that bookings number in September to ever wind up as a quarterly revenue number at some point in the future? Thank you. 
 Rick Wallace: I want to make sure I understand the question, if you don't mind. It's over what time period, what kind of run rate would it take to get to that shipment level? 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs:  Yes, well it is kind of open-ended. Do you have to see orders at that level for one quarter, two quarters, three quarters, four quarters? 
 Rick Wallace: I understand. We run the company around a model for a long time which is to have an unshipped backlog of five to six months. Most of you folks that listen in understand that and the deferred revenue profile is anywhere from two to three months, and I think that model fits well into the way the industry is run today as far as lead times and cycle times are concerned and I think bodes well for us financially and gives us a level of insurance given the cycles in this business, which is really around your question Jim.  I think in your hypothetical example, which is orders come down to a certain level and stay there, we would probably react sooner than maybe the math would suggest just because we have been doing this for awhile and we know backlog is not such a bad thing, particularly around the newer products. We also have the wherewithal obviously, to not have to react very quickly and we could run it at the high 600s for a while, given the high profile.  So it's tough to actually call, Jim. But I think we're ready for either scenario, we can react up or down, depending on what we see over the six to nine months. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs:  Do you think two or three quarters would be enough to cause you to? 
 Rick Wallace:  I think, yes, by the second quarter we are going to be thinking that we want to start protecting not only our R&D stream, our customers, our shareholders and everything. We will probably start tracking things down. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: You talked about $23 million in cancellations, can you give some color on that? Was it any particular type of customer or geography? The $708 million, is that a gross number or net of these cancellations? 
 Jeff Hall:  $708 million is net, so gross is $23 million higher than that. The debookings, what we do is we go through and cull our backlog really line by line every quarter and make sure it is all going to ship out in the next 12 months. We will move it out of there if we think they're not going to ship in the next 12 months. What usually happens, they always come back, they end up shipping or come back and order something else. In this case it was a mix of things, but mostly foundry. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: What was the quarter ending share count? How much do you have in repurchase authorization, what's left at this point? 
 Jeff Hall:  We ended the quarter at 197 million fully diluted shares and we have a little over 12 million shares still authorized for repurchase that we're in the market buying back against every day. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: The foundry reorders are up and I look at your logic orders year-to-date, they're running at a substantially lower run rate versus last year. Sort of going back to an earlier question on the call, whether the 45 nanometer's really helping you here or not. Can you give us some color as to how this logic outsourcing to IBM is impacting the overall pipeline for that combined segment? Secondly, do you think the foundry order level is sustainable or is this just a pooling of these orders into the second quarter here? 
 Rick Wallace: The question around foundries, the strength we saw in foundries, no question being pushed by the advanced design rules and the increasing amount of products they have in terms of NICs inside the foundries that has created an opportunity for them to get leverage using our tools.  We did say we expect logic to pick up in the second half, so logic has been a little bit light and we do see that coming back. So while we think foundry will continue to be strong, relatively strong, we see logic actually improving in the second half. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin - UBS. 
 Stephen Chin - UBS: Just to follow up on that, Rick. I just want to make sure I understood. So do you think this absolute level of orders of foundry customers is sustainable going forward here in the near term? It looks like they did hit the three year high here for KLA. Secondly, are most of these incremental foundry orders for 65 nanometer equipment? 
 Rick Wallace: Stephen, most of what we saw was 65. As we said, we think September is wider just due to the seasonal slow down and we will see some falloff in general in September quarter. But we do think the foundry as a percent remains relatively strong as we said, as we go beyond that. We are obviously not forecasting in the second half of the year or next year, but all the indicators are positive for the foundry business. The logic we said we think will pick up towards the second half. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Edward White - Lehman Brothers. 
 Edward White - Lehman Brothers: I was wondering if you give us an update on the timing that you think you might have for the completion of the integration of the acquisition of ADE and Therma-Wave? When we get to a point where all the charges are done and you begin to get some of the benefits from those acquisitions? 
 Jeff Hall: It is really four acquisitions that we have done here recently; we are in the process of integrating them. Certainly we are pretty well engaged at the moment. Things are going along. They are about 3 or 4 points dilutive to margins today. We think that over the next few quarters we will get them to in line with the rest of our business. 
 Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Are there any charges related to these? Was there some talk of a charge in the September quarter related to acquisitions? 
 Jeff Hall:  The way the accounting works for these is you end up capitalizing a bunch of the intangibles and then amortizing them over the life of the intangibles. So the amortization is going to run for a while, it is going to be about $12.3 million in the September quarter. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Looking at your revenue guidance, it looks like revenues is rolling over a little more steeply than I would have expected. How is it that revenue is actually dipping below shipment levels in a September quarter? If you can help me understand that. 
 Jeff Hall: It as couple of things. Really it is all related to the integration of these recent acquisitions and it really comes down to two things. First, we were able to in June really accelerate the integration of some of the new products into our sales channel and the result of that is we were able to recognize about $20 million of revenue in June that moved in from September.  The second factor is, the other thing we do on the acquisitions, is we've got to convert them to our revenue recognition policy. Our policy is pretty conservative, we only take revenue when a customer's actually signed off. As we convert these products we typically have a quarter, and a lot of that is happening in September, where we recognize zero revenue on the accounting conversion.  So that's what we're seeing. We are seeing $20 million move from September into June because of accelerated integration and another bit of products that's got zero revenue in September because of the conversion of accounting principles. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: So you talked about $468 million of deferred rev exiting June. It sounds like deferred revenue account is going to build significantly in September and looks like you have got a nice tailwind for revenues kicking back in December? Is that the right way to think about the mechanics here? 
 Jeff Hall:  Yes. I think that's right. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Robert Maire - Needham. 
 Robert Maire - Needham: You guided orders down 15% plus or minus 10%. After having covered the company for a while, that is obviously it's within the range of your normal September seasonality. If I took out the seasonality, would you suggest that business was flat or is there any particular tone in business that you are seeing going forward or is it sort of within the noise figure at this point? 
 John Kispert: I understand your question. Our feeling is you take the first half of the calendar year and relative to what we see today in the second half of the year. Given the timing between September and the ending quarter and December ending quarter that it is roughly flat for what we see today, first half to second half. If you put in the historical seasonality that means December would be up to offset that.  I would say on the margin of error, probably what we see today is probably $100 million, $150 million for the second part of the year. That's just the typical movement of orders or opportunities in and out of the second half of the year. But I hope that makes sense. I think it is relatively flat is the way we are looking at it. Maybe 3% to 5%, up or down first half to second half. 
 Robert Maire - Needham:  That makes sense. Since you mentioned it, in terms of orders moving in, moving out, no particular direction or noticeable trend in that? 
 John Kispert:  No, I am just forecasting what it is going to be like in October or November. A typical fourth calendar quarter, where there's lots of jockeying around and queuing up, particularly around our newer products. That's the piece that is hard for us to judge as we bring them out in the second half of the year. How does that play and how quickly does that queue builds. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets. 
 Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: A question on metrology. Looks like it has been very lumpy, even if you take into account acquisitions compared to the last five or six quarters has been up 20%, down 30% in that 30%, 40% kind of range. Is there anything that is different that we need to know? 
 John Kispert: I don't think there is a big change. I am looking at the numbers to see if I see what you see. I don't think -- we have been successful picking up share particularly as Rick mentioned around the earlier 45 nanometer with all the changes that are needed at 45 nanometers. So that has worked well for us, although that is a not a large part of the business right now.  The lumpiness tends to be driven by metrology I think a lot like the process businesses that you folks also cover. The buys are made generally along with the process buys. You buy process tools you buy metrology tools. Through the years I've always felt that in one quarter when it is a much higher percent, it is driven by more buys of lithography and etch and deposition systems and that's typically what the driver is. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Steven Pelayo - HSBC. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC: You made some comments at SemiCON West about December sales funnel looking strong, it looks like you just suggested that revenues could likely grow back in the December quarter based on your shipments. I am curious on your December outlook there. Do you think those orders can return back to the June model? What do you think that suggests then for your December shipment level? 
 John Kispert:  I think it can return to the June levels. I certainly see the opportunities out there. I think it's too far away to actually be able to predict or forecast. I think a lot of the demands we are discussing right now with our customers is driven around their demand and what they perceive for electronics in general; consumer in particular for the second half of this calendar year and that's why the timing of that is difficult, Steve. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC: What about on a December shipment basis? You probably have a little better visibility on that. 
 John Kispert:  Sure. It is queued up very nicely today, for shipments to be relatively at least flat. That's the beauty of the backlog, to Jim Covello's earlier question, is that we're excited to keep shipping right on through the rest of this calendar year. We are cranking away. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC:  And just one to clarify for Jeff here. Your guidance, what is the ongoing EPS assumption there, the tax rate assumption? 
 Jeff Hall:  Right now we are at still 28%. We are continuing to move through our tax planning for the year. But 28% is our core tax rate. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC: The only charge is that $13 million in September? 
 Jeff Hall:  Yes, only charge we are expecting at this point is $12.3 million for intangible. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth - Cowen. 
 Raj Seth - Cowen: A question on the 45 nanometer bookings at 28% of the total. How broad at this point, John, is the participation, is that Intel and a handful of others or is it broader than that? 
 John Kispert:  It is not very broad, Raj, at this point. But it is certainly more than one and we said recently, 10. Inside that 10 are some small orders and some that are further ahead. I think the other inference from this is that we expect it to be broadening over through the second half of the year and into 2008. That's typically how it works and of course the leaders. Those first three to five, I would expect when see that in the forecast that to keep picking up in the upcoming quarters. 
 Raj Seth - Cowen:  When do expect foundries in there? Or are they already a part of that 45 nanometer? 
 John Kispert:  I think it is safe to assume they are a part of that. 
 Raj Seth - Cowen: You talked about operating margin targets at $900 million and $1 billion a quarter levels with ongoing restructuring move to Singapore, et cetera. I am curious just to separate out higher absorption on higher revenues than we have seen. At these kind of revenue levels, $700 million, if you were complete in your transition and you got the 3 or 4 points you expect to get that's currently a drag from the acquisitions, what would operating margins be? 
 John Kispert: Raj, as we get through the acquisitions. As we've said, we have three or four points of drag right now from the acquisitions. We've also talked about our transition to Singapore, that our factory there is only about 5% full at the moment, we think a year or so out, it is going to be more like 50%. That's going to add a couple more points. We have got a bunch of other things we are working on. So it will certainly be a lot higher.  The other thing I would say is this is a culture of continuous improvement. We are going to keep going after things and keep going after ways to improve margins time after time. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank. 
 Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: You talked about the foundries being stronger and maybe maintaining strength into the second half of the year and expecting logic to come back. How do you characterize the memory business? 
 John Kispert: The memory business looks to us to be down, first half to second half. Memory, I am going to include NAND in memory, DRAM and NAND. I think NAND is going to be up half on half for the year and that the DRAM portion of that is going to be down. As far as the dollar value where they offset themselves, I don't think so. I think it is probably slightly down, but as Rick alluded to earlier, as we look out over the next two quarters, we see that the logic investments and we would believe the foundry investments will offset that decline or come close to offsetting that decline and that's how that all adds up for us. 
 Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: With regard to the memory capacity in your backlog do you still feel confident about those tools being shippable in the second half of this year? 
 John Kispert:  Peter, they are beating me over the head to ship them. Nobody's blinking. 
Operator: You have a follow-up question from Tim Arcuri - Citigroup. 
 Tim Arcuri - Citigroup:  Hi, John, I just wanted to clarify something you said. You were implying that I think you were saying that bookings at this point you thought it was roughly flattish first half of the year versus second half of the year. If I just take the mid-point of your guidance for September that means bookings have to grow like 30% sequentially in September. But then it sounds like there is not really enough out there to drive that, if memory is going to be down, per your other comments. So I am just trying to rectify those two. 
 John Kispert:  Yes. I think your math is relatively correct. 30% is probably a little bit higher of what I'm thinking right now quarter on quarter September to December. I think just listening to what you are saying, I think memory is probably a little bit stronger than what you are assuming. I also think that foundry will bounce back more likely in the October, November, December timeframe. Tim, this is not me with a crystal ball, this is me talking to customers. That's all I am repeating back. 
 Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: When you run your macro analysis and look at capital intensity levels and you look at intensity levels in memory and you look at some of the secular shifts going on in foundries, you would have been ordering at a level that has essentially been on average $725 million or $750 million for about seven quarters in a row. So, when you start to add that much capacity to the system, does that argue that we are getting close in your estimation to a pretty sizeable correction? I think that everyone is thinking '08 is going to be a good year. But when you're adding that much capacity, does that actually make you worry? 
 John Kispert:  As far as the business philosophy at KLA-Tencor, I'd say we have been worried for about three, four quarters. That doesn't mean we don't take orders, and try to execute and support our consumers every which way we can. The answer, Tim, is there is not a day that I don't worry about a correction. A couple of questions about what is our philosophy on this. Our philosophy is to be very conservative in how we approach the business and call it as we see them and try to take care of all of our customers, meet their needs as soon as they need them but also have the flexibility to be able to pull back as quickly as possible and I think we are well positioned right now. 
Operator: You have a follow-up question from Steven Pelayo - HSBC. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC:  Rick, just one quick follow-up question. I am curious about your expectations for the 45 nanometer adoption rate. Have those changed at all? Have you thought about what you were thinking about at the beginning of the year and 90 days ago and today? I'm curious if customers are saying that this is harder or easier and that may affect your thoughts on the ramp rate of that? 
 Rick Wallace:  I think that the 45-nanometer, there's no question there's been some industry changes, say if you go back to the beginning of the year in terms of who is doing 45. But I think that the challenges associated with that are continuing as we anticipated and we are obviously a little bit smarter now, having seen more customers deal with it.  So I think that the benefits are still there for our customers, they are all talking about 45. But I was in meetings last week and customers said they are dealing with the ramp and they are terrified of the challenges associated with the inspection of metrology, but they feel compelled to go there from a competitive standpoint.  So I think the challenges are still there. There's been some shift as you indicated toward some people that were going to do it themselves, maybe going through foundries or other ways to get there. But pretty much modeling and as we said at SemiCON West last week, we are a little ahead of our anticipated percent of our bookings for 45s. So the demand certainly seems to be there. On top of all that we're bringing out new products, so to some degree we create additional demand when we do that because when people see the new products they get excited and that helps drive some business for us too. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC: Do you think that the concentration of 45 nanometer bookings actually stays at this level going forward? Or was this a one-quarter pop and then it is going to stay at a lower level before it grows again? 
 Rick Wallace:  No, I think it probably stays in this range and particularly if you think there is an overall slow down. The other thing, John just took a question about the second half. I think what differentiates KLA-Tencor, even if the capacity buy is slowed down, is we continue to get technology buys and that typically in slower parts of the cycle really helps us from an overall business standpoint. So memory may slow down from their capacity and some of the questions that Tim is raising. But technologically they are still pushing very hard and NAND flash is pushing the hardest. So we will see our newer products going to them. So from that standpoint, I think the story's a little different for KLA-Tencor than for the process guys. 
 Steven Pelayo - HSBC:  I mean, it really sounds like from a bottom line basis the dollars at 45 nanometer related equipment are likely flat to up every quarter as far as we can see at this point. 
 Rick Wallace:  That's right. 
Operator:  Your final question comes from the line of Jen Wong - JP Morgan. 
 Jen Wong - JP Morgan: Good afternoon. I just wondered if you could talk a little about 2008. Where do you see CapEx going and where do you see process control going? Do you think memory will come back in the first half of 2008, or how do you see that playing out? 
 Rick Wallace:  That's a great question. I wish we could offer you a lot of insight around that. Like John, the only insight I really get on 2008 is when we talk about customers and hear what they have to say. They'll usually relay stories which aren't really our data, but they'll say they are enthusiastic because of the Olympics or because of Vista or because of additional application coming out in the consumer space, like we've seen recently. So we don't have any particular insight. I think there are people that probably spend more energy trying to figure out. 2008. What we're trying to do is really understand what are our customers needs and we know in the yield and the metrology challenges we're bringing out the products to be able to respond to their needs.  But by and large, our customers are enthusiastic and we are tracking the number of fabs anticipated for 2008, it looks pretty healthy. So from that standpoint for us 45 nanometer, and the challenges associated with that and the general health of the overall industry, we feel pretty good about the future. 
 Jen Wong - JP Morgan:  So you would say it is up more so than flat? 
 Rick Wallace:  I didn't say that. I thought that there are a lot of positive drivers, but there's just way too much in terms of unknown of there 2008. You have to get somebody that has a lot more time to do an analysis of the future. 
 John Kispert:  You know what we do, the macro economic analysis we will do that far out is to listen to a lot of the same folks you listen to and look at their data. Right now, I think you know this, when we look at 2008, we just read the same things you are probably reading. It looks relatively flat, maybe slightly up and of course there is a bell curve around that. Now do we plan for that? No. We find it interesting. We watch it closely. We know it is going to change. As the year goes on, you keep asking the question, I think probably in the middle of 2008, probably a year from now we will have a good idea. 
 Rick Wallace: Thank you all for participating in the conference call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Marvin and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Hall, CFO. Sir you may begin.
Jeff Hall: Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon and welcome to KLA-Tencor's third quarter fiscal year 2007 earnings conference call. I'm Jeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our CEO; and John Kispert, our President and COO. We're here today to discuss our third quarter results for the period ended March 31st, 2007. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 pm Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website at www.KLA-Tencor.com or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today's call with a discussion of industry developments and KLA-Tencor's recent progress and strategy. Afterwards, I'll review the financial results for the third quarter and then I'll open the call up for questions until 3 o'clock Pacific Time. On the investors section of our website, you will find a simulcast of this call, which will be accessible on-demand for 90 days. On the website you will also find a calendar for investor events and presentation at investor conferences. You will also find links to KLA-Tencor's security filings. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that can impact our future results. And as you know, our future results are subject to risks and any forward-looking statements we make are subject to those risks. KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee that those forward-looking statements will come true. And although we take no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you can be assured that any updates we do make will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick.
Rick Wallace: Thank you, Jeff and thank you for joining our earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Today I'll be discussing highlights from the March quarter, updates on key product activity, and guidance for the June quarter. In the March quarter, KLA-Tencor continued to execute and deliver new products to market and producing solid financial results. I'll begin with a quick run down on the numbers and then I'll provide you my perspective. Orders for the March quarter were $689 million, down 5% from the December quarter, and at the mid point of our guidance. Revenue was strong at $716 million. Net income was $171 million or $0.84 per diluted share including stock-based compensation and excluding charges. KLA-Tencor's continued strong performance is the result of meeting our customer's needs with the right products and services to help them be successful. Memory was above 55% of orders, and again the strongest segment in the March quarter with significant D-RAM investment. As expected NAND bookings remained soft at only one-third of our memory bookings. Foundry was about 25% of bookings as a result of increased investment to build out 65-nanometer production capacity. Logic was lowest at around 17% of orders, as demand for 45-nanometer is not expected to pick up until later in 2007. In spite of softness in some specific markets, our outlook for CapEx to be flat to up 5% in calendar 2007 remains unchanged at this time. Let me now give you a couple of updates on our product activity as we continue to demonstrate our product leadership at the leading edge. In the quarter, we introduced our new TeraScan HR Reticle inspection product, which is already installed at several of the world's largest Reticle manufacturers. It is the industry's first 45-nanometer production capable photomask inspection system. The TeraScan HR extends the market proven TaraScan platform, adding auto focus, new database algorithms, accurate modeling of small low PC and advanced Reticles and wide spectrum extendibility to range from 130-nanometer to 45-nanometer nodes as well as 32-nanometer R&D. Our 2800 brightfield inspection systems won several head-to-heads at Asian foundry and memory customers ramping 65-nanometers. Customers are selecting the 2800 because it is the only optical inspection tool capable of detecting critical defects in line using broadband DUV illumination. Customer demand for our Puma system continued to be strong. A leading memory customer is migrating Puma from an incumbent for nine critical layers because the Puma combines the high throughput characteristics of darkfield inspection with the high sensitivity imaging necessary to capture defects on a small design. KLA-Tencor is the leading inspection and metrology company and our continued commitment to differentiated products was illustrated by KLA-Tencor's market share gain in the recently release State of Quest 2006 market share report. I'm proud of this achievement, which is a result of our employees' dedication to delivering the products and services our customers require to increase their yields and profitability. Across the industry, the problem and challenges of qualifying 45-nanometer are significant. We're actively working with customers on multiple aspects of 45-nanometer adoption. As always, we have a number of new products under development and plan several new product introductions over the next several months that are critical to 45-nanometer. We believe the company is strongly positioned to continue to outgrow the industry in 2007. Wrapping up, let me give you our guidance for June. Orders down 5% plus or minus 10% from our March quarter. Revenue between $700 million and $715 million and EPS of $0.84 to $0.86 including stock-based compensation and excluding charges. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff Hall.
Jeff Hall: Thank you, Rick. Let me start by going through the quarter in a little more detail. Net bookings for the March ending quarter were $689 million, which is roughly 5% lower than the December ending quarter. And 12% higher than the quarterly results from one year ago. Every quarter we review our backlog in detail and de-book in accordance with our booking policy that restricts actual become bookings to a set criteria. The set criteria mandate that technical specifications are signed off, valid terms and conditions are finalized and delivery is scheduled within 12 months. This quarter we de-booked $11.5 million of orders. Total backlog remained approximately flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.6 billion. Remember, we do not include any service bookings in this backlog number. Shipment backlog, tools for which we have taken orders but have not shipped, was at $1.05 billion, or approximately 5.5 months. Revenue backlog, tools that have shipped but have not yet been accepted for revenue, was $509 million or approximately three months. We remain confident that we have a strong backlog shippable over the next six to nine months. Our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain profitability throughout any business cycles. The regional distribution of orders for the March quarter was as follows: The U.S. was 17%, lower than its historical average of 25%. Taiwan was 31%, higher than its historical average of 20%. Korea, China and Singapore combined were 16%, lower than their historical average of 20%. Europe was 8%, lower than its historical average of 10%. And Japan was 28%, higher than its historical average of 25%. The product distribution of orders was: Wafer inspection was approximately 48%; Reticle inspection was 16%; metrology was 18%; data storage was 2%, and service was 16%. Before I start with the income statement, let me summarize the special charges in the quarter. The charges fall into three buckets: First, we had $18 million of non-cash charges related to acquisition, primarily ADE. $10.5 million is included in cost of goods sold, $2 million is included in R&D, and $5.4 million is included in SG&A. In the June quarter, we expect charges related to acquisitions to decline by about $4 million. These estimates exclude potential charges for Therma-Wave. Second, we had $15.3 million of onetime charges related to our stock option investigations. $1.7 million is included in cost of goods sold, $2 million is included in R&D and $11.5 million is included in SG&A. These charges are for legal and investigative costs, costs related to the resolution of employee tax issues resulting from IRS Section 409A for non-executive employees. And compensating -- compensation expenses for -- compensating non-executive employees for lost benefits due to suspension of the employees' stock purchase plan. Finally, we had $5.4 million in onetime tax benefits resulting from the closure of several audits. Now, turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was $716 million, up about 10% quarter-to-quarter, and up 38% from the same quarter last year. GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 57.2%, this includes 10.5 million of charges for acquisition and deal related amortization and $1.7 million for stock option investigation related charges. Excluding theses items gross margins including stock option was 58.9%, up about 240 basis points from Q2 as inefficiencies and bubble costs related to the integration of acquisitions and the movement of operations to Asia were more than offset by reductions in cycle time and other operational improvements. GAAP operating expenses including both SG&A and R&D were $227 million, this number includes $7.5 million of charges for acquisitions and deal related amortization and 13.5 million for stock option investigated related charges. Excluding these items, operating expense was $205.8 million, down $2 million from the prior quarter. As efficiencies realized in the quarter, more than offset increases from the first full quarter of ADE and the addition of OnWafer and SensArray. For the quarter, other income was $20.8 million. The effective GAAP tax rate was 23.9%. This rate is lower than our ongoing tax rate of 28%, as a result of the one-time charges and the 5.4 million of discrete items discussed earlier. GAAP net income for the quarter was $154.8 million or $0.76 per fully diluted share. Excluding the one-time charges previously discussed, net income was $170.8 million or $0.84 per fully diluted share. This number includes share based compensation expenses of $0.10 per diluted share, and the approximate breakout is cost of goods sold, $0.03, R&D, $0.05, SG&A, $0.06, and a tax benefit of $0.05. In the June 2007 quarter, we expect expense for share-based compensation to be similar to March. Now turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter of $1.6 billion, a decrease of $558 million quarter-to-quarter as a result of the previously announced $750 million accelerated share repurchase plan, which is expected to be complete by the end of the June quarter. Inventory decreased by $34 million to $530 million. Accounts receivable increased in the quarter by $51 million to $499 million principally as a result of the increase in tools awaiting acceptance in Japan. Capital additions related to fixed assets were approximately $24 million for the quarter, as we continue the construction of our new facility in Asia. Depreciation was 15 million. On a net basis, including retirements, fixed assets increased by $9 million over the quarter. Cash generated by operating activities was $198 million. We paid a dividend of $24 million and headcount ended the March quarter at approximately 6,000. Finally, to recap the guidance, Rick gave for June. And again, all excluding Therma Wave. Bookings was down 5%, plus or minus 10%, revenue between $700 million and $715 million, operating expenses approximately flat, interest income of approximately $16 million, shares outstanding of approximately $194 million, and EPS including share based compensation but excluding one time charges and deal related amortization of $0.84 to $0.86. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call over to Marvin to give the polling instructions, let me request that you refrain from asking multi-part question to give others some time. As always we're all on a tight schedule. Marvin, can you begin the polling, please?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citigroup.
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi, guys. Two things. First of all, Jeff, obviously the EPS guidance here is very strong. When you look at your cost structure relative to the financial model that you put up at Semicon West last year. Where do you think you are right now relative to that model? Are you almost of to it? Are you at it?
Jeff Hall: Yes, thanks, Tim. The way we look at it is, obviously, we've made some progress but we're about where we want to be to slightly ahead of the model at this point, but still a lot of hard work to do from here.
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, okay. So, actually relative to that model, if there are incremental expense steps taken from here going forward that's going to put you even above that model, right?
Jeff Hall: Our plan is to continue marching to the model that we laid out about a year ago.
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay and then last thing from me. Have you seen any push outs recently; there's been a couple. I think there was one in memory, and there's been a couple foundry related. Have you seen any push outs lately. So, is your guidance meaning fully different in terms of orders today, then it would have been say a month to six weeks ago?
John Kispert: Hey, Tim, it's John. I think, there's two things we've seen over the last 30 days. One is in the microprocessor logic space, where you've seen some changes in strategy. It was a handful of customers, European customers, Japanese customers, and we've seen some orders that would have expected not only in the March quarter, but some in the June quarter, probably sitting now in firmly in the second half of the calendar year. Not a big number but certainly some movement and that's really folks changing where they want to get things built or changing fact maybe they're not going to do R&D in one particular facility and do it in a different way. I think the other change across the industry has been and to your point in the last 30 days and that's been in the memory space. I think that one as is more focused, it hasn't been huge to this point. The orders are still within the calendar year. It looks like, if I were to characterize it stuff that we'd expect to kind of in this timeframe, in this June ending quarter is moved out to more into the September, October, November timeframe. Again, not a big number and very isolated to one or two customers.
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Okay, John. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of A.J. Safalow with JPMorgan.
A.J. Safalow - JPMorgan: Hello, good afternoon. John, just a follow-up on that particular question. Are you seeing any foundry push-outs? And do you expect the foundry demand to trend higher from here?
John Kispert: A.J., the foundry numbers you hopefully can tell with the numbers that, Jeff gave you we saw a nice uptick in foundry in the March ending quarter. I think if anything, the number will be about the same in the June quarter, if not some upside to it. And I think the thing, it looks strong into the second half of the year. The thing we're trying to figure out here is, as you see changes with other folk strategies how will that show up in the foundry, spanning through the second half of this calendar year. And that's something that I wouldn't be able to answer right now, but we're certainly looking at it.
A.J. Safalow - JPMorgan: So, basically no recent weakness in foundries, correct?
John Kispert: Not, on the order front, or the shipment front, no.
A.J. Safalow - JPMorgan: Okay, good. Then my second question is, is the difficulty in technology transitions to either 65-nanometer for foundry or 17-nanometer for DRAM, is it causing or is it likely to cause any sort of non-demand related slowdowns in the capacity rounds?
John Kispert: A.J., you're talking about memory?
A.J. Safalow - JPMorgan: Yes. I'm talking about both memory and DRAM. In the case of foundry going to 65-nanometer and in the case of DRAM going to 17-nanometer. Do you see people having technical problems in bringing the yields up that you think might cause them to push out their plans, which has nothing to do with the end demand?
Rick Wallace: Hi, A.J., it's Rick, great question. In fact, what we do see is people very concerned about their yield challenges at the two notes you talked about, and that has really got us engaged with a number of customers, trying to help them work through that. Certainly nobody wants to slip out their production because they struggle with yield and that's really caused us to get very involved and has driven demand for some of our leading edge products to help them do that. We don't see a push-out as a result but we do see it as one of the drivers for increased investment in process control as a result.
A.J. Safalow - JPMorgan: Just a quick follow-up to that question, sort of a different take on the same thing, if we see DRAM prices and/or demand start to rebound. Do you think some of the second tier DRAM makers would actually do more at 19-nanometers, rather than scramble to accelerate the 17-nanometer.
Rick Wallace: When we talk with customers what we find is they all of them; figure particularly in the memory space think the advantages are pretty compelling on the leading edge. So they're pushing really hard to meet the demands and the demands continue to be strong on the leading edge; I think there's more capacity in place for the 90-nanometer note as you know. So, really we don't see that trend to be backing off, I think what people are trying to figure out. Get the new process up and ramped and win design ends, so we haven't seen that trend you're talking about, not saying that it's not there.
Jeff Hall: Thank you. Marvin, who is next?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Yeah, hi thanks for talking my question. John three months ago you were talking about orders being flat to up in June. Clearly, you've talked about seeing some microprocessor and memory push outs, the fundamentals for your customers has gotten significantly worse in the last three months. And June is your seasonally strong quarter; how does the order look in the back half of the year? Particularly as you look at September is there a possibility that you could see more than a double-digit decline in orders?
John Kispert: Yes Satya, that's the key question; certainly we're focused on it. It is those two buckets if you will the logic microprocessor thing that we're watching; I think that one will play itself out really well, I think the key things you look for are pricing an inventory. I think those are all healthy, it's just a matter of decisions being made and investments being made. So the second bucket that's probably more concerning, and one that we're going to just stay focused on we've been focused on it for many years. And clearly declining returns for our customers, are going to eventually lead to lower capital investments, the feeling we get talking to our customers is that, the investments they're making are strategic, they see the demand at the leading edge as Rick was saying. We don't see people blinking or pulling back I think that's evident in our ship rates. And in our guidance that on the memory side that they are pushing forward, but we're going to keep our eyes on it for obvious reasons.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: And then a quick follow-up to that, typically when you see the possibility of the customers particularly the memory bucket weaken as much as it has. You start to see them cut CapEx or ask for better pricing, and there's a couple memory companies that are talking about getting better equipment pricing from Japan and Korea. And talking about getting volume discounts, are you seeing any changes in your pricing environment that out of the realm of normal course of action over the last three months?
John Kispert: No real changes, you've changed jobs you're now in procurement sounds like. No we're forever dealing with delivery and pricing and economic terms and conditions that we're forever trying to increase the value that we create in fabs, I think very key as Rick said in the opening comment is for us to keep coming out with newer products. The more unique defects that cost our customers lots of dollars, we're excited by things like immersion and double patterning, and certainly the issues that still surround high K materials, and changes there and different architecture changes, I think the value that is represented in tracking these things and measuring them is continuously increasing, we probably see less pressures than other folks in the equipment industry 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: I was wondering, if you could take a shot at sort of sizing, in the past. You've given us what the opportunity for fab is, as you move down the technology curve and now that you're getting more insight into the 65-nanometer and 45-nanometers nodes. How those compare to what your sales opportunity is per fab, or as you move down to those areas.
Rick Wallace: Hey Brad it's Rick. I'll start that, and let Jeff come back with some numbers, I think in general I would say that it tends to be playing out pretty much as we anticipated, with the focus being very heavily on trying to get quick yield ramps for our customers; but we're clearly seeing the increased number of places that people want to measure and inspect. And particularly, people are very concerned about the yieldability of the 45-nanometer node; 65 people had more progress on that. So we're clear on the profile, 45 is a bit less clear because as you know they're really earlier in that development, but we're seeing it play out pretty much as we thought. And we're getting a lot of traction with our advanced customers as they struggle with some of the challenges. And obviously you know Immersion is a great example, where I think there are lot of defectivity challenges around Immersion petrography, and that's playing out as we anticipated. Jeff you want to...
Jeff Hall: Yes, so you know Brett we look at these, and obviously there's no standard average fab. But as we try to look at what an average fab would do. The way we look at it is going from 90 to 65; our opportunity grew about 20% plus or minus. And from 65 to 45 we think our opportunity grows 30% plus.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: So a little bit bigger leverage than what you've seen in the past. Given some of the new issues that Rick was just mentioning?
Jeff Hall: Absolutely, 65 to 45 looks better than 90 to 65.
Rick Wallace: Yes I agree with that. There has you know Brett as we thought as for while there are nodes in the past that were particularly challenging, everybody I talked to that's been around it a while, it feels that 45 is as tough as any have been.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgerald with Banc of America.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Two quick questions, the memory guys are all advertising their CapEx as front end loaded, do you guys see that in your own business at this point; is it a factor. How they announce their CapEx not material to where you guys book business and ship?
John Kispert: You know Mark; it's something that we've wrestled with for years as you know. As I look out over, let me just say the next six months. Memory looks to continue to be roughly 50% of our business it's not 60, but 50%.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: 50% lower levels?
John Kispert: It's lower levels, but still very healthy.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Okay, so, the way they're advertising they're forecasting. You are expecting to see that in your own business in the second half.
John Kispert: I think in the second half memory orders will probably be lighter than they were in the first half; I think foundry will probably be picking up, certainly that's the communication we're having.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: And then just one quick question on the share count Jeff that you gave the guidance, it was 194 million, and is that based on the buyback that's been completed as of the quarter you just reported and doesn't account for anything that might be done this quarter?
Jeff Hall: Well, that's correct, it just accounts for the buyback that's currently in progress.
Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Thanks. You were talking about the than NAND flash area being relatively weak in the quarter, how do you see that as you look to the second half of the year; is that your opinion that, that comes back as far as your business is concerned or not?
John Kispert: Let me start out Ed, it was about 30% or so of memory this last quarter.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Yeah.
John Kispert: And then, my best guess right now would be maybe 40% in the June quarter, so I think it's probably a little bit stronger. And as we look out into the second half of the year it gets pretty foggy, I think as you know that major customers can move it kind of back and forward relatively quickly.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Yeah.
John Kispert: It's a difficult thing to call maybe, further than 90 days out, but right now I'd say it's probably stronger than say 90 days ago.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and then a question for Jeff, any way to think about how to model the impact of Therma-Wave I had realize that may not all be figured out yet; but any way to look at that?
Jeff Hall: You know we said, it's going to be a little bit dilutive for a couple of quarters. There's some pretty big integration to do there, it certainly could bring gross margin down a tiny little bit, in the beginning as we move through the integration, but as you saw with ADE. We think we're work it through pretty quickly.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay, great, thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Suing with CIBC world markets.
Gary Suing - CIBC World Markets: Hey, thanks for taking my question; instead of kind of slicing and dicing fundamentals by memory foundry logic buckets. Thought, I'd look at wafer inspection metrology and Reticle inspection, specifically Reticle inspection. We saw a little bit of an up tick here in terms of Reticle inspection orders in the March quarter, and if I look historically; Retical inspection orders are nice kind of leading indicator for inspection and metrology orders. So, I am just trying to gauge a sense of directionally where are Reticle inspection orders going in June, and given the kind of long lead times there in that business. Do we have sort of visibility on what the ultimate key could be in the back half of this year? Just remember that the last time I think if I got these numbers right you peaked in terms of Reticle inspection orders they peaked at roughly 150 million. Do we have visibility on a ramp in Reticle inspection to that kind of prior peak level?
Rick Wallace: Hey Gary it's Rick. Great question. There are some obviously some positive signs we see in our Reticle world based on all the work that's going on with the advanced designer roles. As you know it's a relatively small number of key customers and we work very closely with them. That being said, from our vantage right now, it looks to be pretty flat going forward which is healthy, and as you know because of our lead times, we're working very closely with customers to map out their needs and our capacity. So, we don't see and particular there is a lot of a particularly change coming up. We also see that there's a lot of work going on at the advanced nodes and that's really driving customers to the TeraScanHR, which I talked about earlier so we're seeing a lot of the new product activity. At the same time, Reticle also goes in the fab-line and we've had some pretty healthy performance there as well. But, flat is kind of how we see it.
Gary Suing - CIBC World Markets: I mean, thanks for the answer. Is there any kind of mix shift going on I mean any kind of volatility kind of making that flat in the back half and just given sort of the ramp and the foundries at 65-nanometer the 70-nanometer ramp and DRAM 56-nanometer NAND flash. So, it just seems like, there's a hell of a lot of design transitions going on. I would have thought that number could have moved up throughout the rest of this year. I mean, any other kind of mix changes that might be kind of offsetting any kind of benefits in the back half?
Rick Wallace: Gary, we don't see a particular shift, other than the traditional shift as people are bringing in their newer designs as you mentioned and so that's really leading customers towards the latest generation product, but not anything that would substantially move the overall level of the business.
Gary Suing - CIBC World Markets: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Ballero with HSBC.
Steven Ballero - HSBC: Yeah Jeff, first some housekeeping questions here. Does the ongoing EPS of $0.84 for March, is that based on a normal tax rate or is that including the benefit there? And then what's your tax rate assumption for June?
Jeff Hall: The guidance is assuming a 28% tax rate, which is my assumption.
Steven Ballero - HSBC: And the just reported $0.84 ongoing.
Jeff Hall: Also 28%.
Steven Ballero - HSBC: That was all 28. And then I don't know if this is more for John or you Jeff. Shipments in March and June, what are your thoughts there. And lastly specifically for you Jeff, would you just remind you of your model and your margin outlook. Let's just say if you held 700 million in revenue for the next four quarters. What kind of gross on operating margins could you do?
Jeff Hall: Okay. So, shipments about 670 in the March quarter, June quarter 670 to 700 in that range. Growth margin, we keep working on it here. We're in transition on a bunch of things, so we'll see it at about these levels if revenue holds.
Steven Ballero - HSBC: Okay. And maybe I'll just..
Jeff Hall: Revenue goes up and it goes up 60 to 70%.
Steven Ballero - HSBC: Okay. I'll just sneak in one more. You guys generated 200 million in operating cash flow you are buying back 750 million in stock. That kind of cash flow generation, you're really not putting a dent in your large treasure chest of cashier. Any plans beyond the 750 and maybe plans for a dividend increase any thoughts there?
Jeff Hall: Certainly it's getting a lot of discussion here internally. Obviously we've done a lot here recently, over 500 million of good accretive deals here recently we did the 750 million buy back in February, we've still got another 13.5 million shares authorized past that. So certainly gets active discussion here, but nothing that we're talking about announcing on this call.
Steven Ballero - HSBC: All right. Fair enough, thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. 
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, I just want to build a little bit more on the second half. If you look at the foundry, the PSMs is already pretty strong in terms of ordering the order close to a billion dollars in Q1 and so about to order about 7, 800 million in Q2. Well, UMC and Charter being weak, I don't understand how foundry's can provide upside and on the logic side, we have just the Intel and EMD and EMD being weak and Intel being usually flattish. I can't come up with any larger customers, who can give the upside. So I'm having difficulty in figuring out what's going to fill in the gap wholesome memory in the second half?
John Kispert: I think Mahesh it's really -- I'm not going to talk about specific customers. It's difficult to answer the question without talking about specific customers, but the drivers are very consistent in that 65-nanometer capacity and 45-nanometer. In some case pilot and other cases ramping. It's those orders that we're talking about across a multitude of customers.
Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Kim with Deutsche Bank.
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to just cover the shipments it looks like your shipments fell a little shy of what you had expected. Could you characterize that for us?
John Kispert: Sure. I missed the name.
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Peter Kim. Covering a shipment around.
John Kispert: Okay. Hey it's John Kispert. It's really shipments were, number were a little bit lighter by 30 million or so the March quarter and it was really two things. One was a fab that wasn't ready. It wasn't fit. So we actually have shipped it already here in the -- this month. It just didn't get shipped last month. It's a set of products going to a fab that just wasn't like frankly electrically ready to handle wherever we're going to shipments, so we held onto the inventory. The other half of the 30 million or so was in the Reticle business and it was a product that wasn't signed off and got signed off the first week of this quarter and so we'll count it this quarter. As far as the guidance that Jeff, just gave you for shipments or what we're kind of shooting for it's a number about that 700 million range because that's kind of where the business is running right now. And that's a capacity we have in place and I would assume it's going to be a number somewhere around there depending upon delivery times for our customers. 
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you, if I could just follow up with a quick follow-up question regarding your Reticle inspection. In the past you talked about Reticle inspection penetrating the fab as the geometries get smaller. How do you see the fab penetration of your Reticle inspection tools at that time 45-nanometer versus 65?
Rick Wallace: Peter, great question. I think at 65, we definitely saw adoption. Remember what's driving that is the concerns about the crystal and defects continuing to go through the process and the most customers that have experienced that. So we have two kinds of customers, the ones that know that ahead of time and the ones that suffer through that and try to get tools to deal with it. At 45 everybody is pretty educated on the challenges, so we expect to see earlier demand for that as people start working through their plans and that's, but the timing for 45 production becomes much later. So, we think that's something that's ongoing, will build the business going forward. But the Reticle and fab has been part of the story for Reticle inspection.
Peter Kim - Deutsche Bank: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Pang with Caris. 
Ben Pang - Caris: Yes, quick question in terms of our per fab opportunity 30% that you commented on 45-nanometer to 65-nanometer. How much of that is due to more tools and how much of that is due to higher prices for your tools? How should we think about that?
Rick Wallace: Yes, Ben, Rick again. I think we thing about it 50/50. I think on the one hand there's more tools because there's more capability required. Some people are running them at higher sensitivity. Which means they need more capability and there are more place that's they want to run them. Additionally, the mix toward the higher end tool increases, and so that of course drives newer technology and the ASPs that go along with that. So those are the two factors that have been driving us as we look forward and similar factors that have driven us in the past.
Ben Pang - Caris: And when you mentioned like the higher capability tools. Is that in any specific area between metrology and inspection?
Rick Wallace: No, it's really in all of them I mean if you look at our product life cycle, the company we develop maybe 10 or 12 new products a year. And what they typically are as the latest generation tool, which builds on the existing. Usually by adding throughput or new algorithms or new sensitivity, so what happens over time is the customers upgrade to the mix, it's more biased toward the latest tool. So it really is across our product line.
Ben Pang - Caris: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Jagdish Iyer - UBS: Hi. This is Jagdish Iyer on behalf of Stephen Chin. I have two quick questions. My first question is, Rick you had mentioned that NAND flash was softener the March quarter, given that a lot of announcements by some of these memory customers to migrate toward NAND flash in the second half of '07. And, do you see any challenges? Do you see in terms of opportunity being increased given that some of the NAND customers are facing challenges in terms of improving yield? That is my first question, and my second question I have a quick follow-up, please.
Rick Wallace: Yes, sure. There's no question that NAND in particular is driving people from a yield and defectivity standpoint because they tend to drive more advanced design rules even to satisfy consumer market. So, that presents opportunities. That being said, DRAM has not been an easy transition either. So, people have been going to invest you pretty heavily there. So, I don't know that the switch to NAND particularly drives our business more. But, I know the focus on yield management has been steadily increasing.
Jagdish Iyer - UBS: I have a quick one on metrology. I just was wondering why March was a little bit lighter than the usual. Is there anything or is it just a seasonal thing that we should be looking not more than in?
John Kispert: It tends to be a lumpier business for us but with larger capacity buys. So, It's really timing on particular orders, nothing that abnormal.
Jagdish Iyer - UBS: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Bachman with Pacific Crest.
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi. I was to begin here I am Mark. I was wondering if you could give me a little bit more color on your progress I guess on your overseas expansion plans?
John Kispert: Hey, that's one more time. I'm sorry.
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: I was wondering if you could give us an update on your overseas expansion plans?
John Kispert: Sure. I think for everybody else, Wes, I'm going to say this so we're all on the same page. The company has been focused I'd say over the last year on expanding and refining our worldwide footprint. So, we can focus on being closer to our customers, working closer with them. Obviously, tapped into technologies and talents throughout the world and I think thirdly manage our costs now and into the future. We've done a bunch of things, one of which is to open up a new training and manufacturing and service facility in Singapore. Very aggressive schedule on the facility itself. We now are about two months away from actually opening the facility. So, later on this quarter we'll announce the opening of it. We plan to be shipping product out of it within the following quarter and ramping steadily. We have a list of products that we'll begin to move out of different parts of KLA-Tencor around the world into the Singapore facility and we're very focused on the efficiency, productivity of that organization and think it will add not only to the career paths at KLA-Tencor and the capabilities of KLA-Tencor, but the cost structure of KLA-Tencor.
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, great. And how about on India, I guess, is there a, I don't know if you've talked about a facility in India for engineering.
John Kispert: Yes, we have about 450 folks in India have for a while. It's a combination of engineering and what's called applications engineer at KLA-Tencor. Those are the folks that really work with our products, our tools and help our customers with yield. And of course a lot of back office kind of support, tremendous amount has happened at KLA over the last year or so in that regard. It's going very well. At this point don't think we'll be adding a tremendous amount more to it. We've done a lot of that. I think, Jeff mentioned earlier that we right now we're suffering through some, what we call bubble costs in that the inefficiencies of having organizations getting moved over time, there are inefficiencies. But we're getting through that and that gives us confidence in the management team in the entire company that we're going in the right direction because we see steady improvements and improved productivity and efficiency.
Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi, guys. Just on, there was a recap announced in the semi space. You look at what Linear Tech did. They issued a pretty significant amount of debt and they used it to basically buy back their stock. I know that, if you actually run the numbers, you know you have a much greater capacity to even do something like that than even they do. So, with the stock where it is, there's a lot of reasons of believe that it's pretty attractively valued down here. So, I'm wondering how you think about all the different option that's you have, be it a straight buy back, be it a leveraged recap or be it a higher dividend. How do you think about those different options? Thanks.
Jeff Hall: Thanks, Tim. Yes, we spend a fair amount of time talking about various alternatives here, both internally and of course with our board. Conference call is probably not the most appropriate time to air out all of our thinking on that. But, you can rest assured we keep thinking about it. If we think that and our board think that there's a good move for our shareholders we'll execute like we have in the past.
Tim Arcuri - Citigroup: But I guess more specifically, was that specific deal, was that surprising to you that it was that big?
Jeff Hall: Tim, I don't follow linear so it's hard for me to comment. All right, thanks.
Operator: And there seem to be no further questions.
Jeff Hall: Thank you, Marvin. Thank you, everyone for joining the call today. And we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin your conference. 
 Jeff Hall: Good morning and welcome to KLA-Tencor’s second quarter of fiscal year 2007 earnings conference call. I am Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our CEO; and John Kispert, our President and COO. We're here today to discuss our second quarter results for the period ended December 31, 2006. We released these results this morning at 4:30 a.m. Pacific time. If you haven't seen the release or the recent SEC filing, you can find them on our web site at www.KLA-Tencor.com or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy.  On the investor section of our web site you will find a simulcast of this call, which will be accessible on demand for 90 days. On the web site, you will also find a calendar for investor events and presentations at investor conferences. You will also find links to KLA-Tencor's security filings. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that can impact our results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks and any forward-looking statements we make are subject to those risks and are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee that any of those forward-looking comments will come through, and although we take no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you can be assured any updates we do make will be broadly disseminated and available over the web.  We have a lot to cover today. I will start with a brief overview of the restatement and the June and September results that were released last week. I will then turn it over to Rick who will discuss industry developments and KLA-Tencor's recent progress and strategies. I will then review the financials for the December quarter and then we will open the call for questions.  As most of you know, on January 29 we filed our 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2006 and our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. These filings brought us back into compliance with all SEC reporting requirements and NASDAQ listing requirements. The delay in these filings was the result of the stock options investigation and resulting restatement. The investigation found that there was retroactive pricing of stock options; less than 15% of the retroactively-priced stock options were granted to senior executives. Retroactive pricing occurred primarily from 1997 to 2002 and no current members of management were involved in the retroactive pricing.  As a result of these findings, we have restated our financial statements back to 1995. Total share-based compensation charges were $376 million. $348 million of this charge was for fiscal 2005; $22 million of this charge was for fiscal 2006; and $6 million of this charge were for periods after fiscal 2006. The majority of this amount hit the quarter ended September 30, 2006. Other than the stock options issued, the investigation found no evidence of any financial reporting or other accounting issues.  Moving on to the June and September quarters, since this is all historical data and we have published the 10-K and 10-Q for these quarters, I'm only going to cover the highlights. If you have any questions on the details, I will be happy to take them in the Q&A.  Revenue for the June 2006 quarter was $579 million, up 11% from the March quarter and up 18% from the June quarter in the prior year. Net income for the June quarter was $132 million or $0.65 per diluted share. This EPS includes $0.13 of share-based compensation. The approximate breakout was COGS, $0.05; R&D, $0.06; SG&A, $0.08; and a tax benefit of $0.06.  Net income for the June quarter also included the following pre-tax charges: $27 million, or $0.08 per share, to cost of goods sold related to exiting the [CDM] business and $21 million or $0.07 per share to SG&A for expenses related to the stock option investigation. In the June quarter, cash from operations was $130 million, capital purchases were $15 million, and depreciation was $17 million.  Moving to the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ended September 30, 2006 revenue for the quarter was $629 million, up about 9% quarter to quarter and up 30% year over year. Net income for the September quarter was $136 million or $0.67 per diluted share. This EPS included share-based compensation of $0.13 and the approximate breakout is: COGS, $0.04; R&D, $0.06; SG&A, $0.09, and a tax benefit of $0.06. Net income also included pre-tax expenses related to the stock option investigation of $2.5 million or $0.01 per share. In the September quarter, cash from operations was $107 million, capital purchases were $12 million, and depreciation was $15 million.  With that, I'll turn it over to Rick.

 Rick Wallace : Thank you, Jeff and thank you for joining our earnings call for the second quarter FY07. Today I'll be discussing the highlights for the December quarter, updates on key product activity, and guidance for the March quarter.  In the December quarter, the company continued to execute on delivering new products and producing solid financial results. I'll begin with a quick rundown of the numbers and then I'll provide my perspective.  Orders for the December quarter were $725 million, up 12%; revenue was $649 million, at the lower end of our guidance. This was a timing issue resulting from a special upgrade we did to meet customer needs. Shipments were at the high end of expectations at $700 million; and excluding special charges, net income was $147 million or $0.72 per diluted share, including stock-based compensation. This strong financial performance is the result of meeting our customers' needs with the right products and services to help them be successful.  Memory was about 50% of orders, and again, the strongest segment in the December quarter with significant DRAM spending. NAND remains soft at only 30% of our memory bookings. Logic at around 30% of orders was also strong in December with investment and capacity in the U.S. the primary driver. Boundary was at the lowest segment at 15% of bookings. Boundary continued to spend under their historical rates as they cautiously add manufacturing capacity to existing fabs. We expect an increase in foundry orders as we go through 2007 in order to build out 65 nanometer capacity.  Looking ahead to 2007, we see a healthy semiconductor industry, but with some softness in specific markets. Current projections are for semi revenues to be up 5% to 7% and for CapEx to be flat to up 5% in 2007.  Let me now give you a couple of updates on our product activity. We continue to demonstrate our product leadership at the leading edge. Our Puma Darkfield inspection system continues its success as one of KT's fastest adopted products. In the December quarter, the 9130 won a head-to-head at a major Taiwanese memory fab because of our breakthrough Streak technology provided both high sensitivity for etch line monitor and high throughput for tool monitor applications.  Our 2800 Brightfield tool demonstrated superior DRAM performance for next generation design rules. A major Korean memory manufacturer chose the 2800 after it demonstrated five times better capture rate and 40% faster throughput than the competition on a critical layer.  During the December quarter, we also announced two new products: the VisEdge CV300 and the Archer 100 that will help our customers address the increasing lithography challenges including immersion and double patterning. With the recently announced acquisition of Thermawave, we are looking forward to extending our market leadership in metrology and supporting our long-term growth strategy. Thermawave’s portfolio of technologies in thin film and optical CD are complementary to KT’s existing solution.  In addition, Thermawave’s strong position in the growing implant dose monitoring market represents a new opportunity for us. We expect the deal to close in the March quarter, at which point we'll focus on integrating Thermawave and continuing to support their customers.  I am also pleased to announce that we have recently completed acquisitions of two private companies, OnWafer and SensArray, whose main products are on wafer metrology tools which solve the difficult challenge of controlling critical dimensions in both lithography and etch. This high precision measurement capability is critical for process development, tool matching, equipment maintenance, and production monitoring and is complementary with KLA-Tencor’s broad range of advanced metrology solutions.  Across the industry, the problems and challenges of qualifying 45 nanometer are significant. We are actively working with customers on multiple aspects of 45 nanometer adoption as evidenced by nearly one-quarter of our bookings being for 45 nanometer and below in the December quarter. As always, we have a number of new products under development and plan several new product introductions over the next several months that are critical to 45 nanometer.  Wrapping up, let me give you our guidance for March: orders down 5%, plus or minus 10%; revenues up between $700 million and $715 million; and shipments about $700 million; EPS of $0.76 to $0.79, including stock-based compensation. We will continue to see margin leverage over the mid to long term as we progress on our strategy. The company is strongly positioned to continue to outgrow the industry in 2007.  Our growth in yield management and process control is driven by the ROI that our tools provide for our customers. Our industry-leading products continue to enable our customers to meet their technical challenges and increase their profitability.  Now I will turn the call back to Jeff. 
 Jeff Hall : Thank you, Rick. We closed our acquisition of ADE on October 12, so the results for the second quarter include ADE from October 12th through December 31. As I told you on the call last quarter, we expected ADE to contribute bookings of $30 million, revenue of $20 million, be slightly dilutive to gross margin, and add $10 million to fixed costs. ADE performance was in line with our expectations. As I told you last quarter, since we are running ADE as a division of KLA-Tencor, we do not intend to break out or discuss the numbers on this call or going forward.  Net bookings for the December quarter were $725 million. Each quarter we review our backlog in detail and de-book in accordance with our bookings policy that restricts actual bookings to a set criteria. The set criteria mandates that technical specifications are signed off, valid terms and conditions are finalized, and delivery is scheduled within 12 months. This quarter, we de-booked $21.8 million of orders. Backlog for unshipped orders was $23 million in the quarter at $1 billion, or approximately five-and-a-half months at current shipping levels. We do not include any service bookings in this backlog number.  In addition, deferred revenue was up $54 million to $558 million, or about three months at current revenue levels. This is invoiced systems revenue deferred under SAB 104. It includes no service revenue and is made up of tools delivered but awaiting written acceptance from the customer.  We remain confident that we have a strong backlog shippable over the next six to nine months. Our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain profitability throughout any business cycle.  The regional distribution of orders for the December quarter was as follows: the U.S. was 22%, lower than its historical average of 25%; Taiwan was 25%, higher than its historical average of 20%; Korea, China, Singapore combined were 23%, higher than their historical average of 20%; Europe was 9%, lower than its historical average of 10%; and Japan was 21%, lower than its historical average of 25%.  The product distribution of orders was: wafer inspection was 46%, reticle inspection was 13%, metrology was 25%, data storage was 2% and service was 14%.  Before we start with the income statement, let me summarize the special charges in the quarter. They fall into three separate buckets:  First, as we continue to execute on our four-year plan to restructure the business and increase operating margins, we incurred $67 million in one-time charges in the quarter. As we consolidate our facilities requirements, we put some buildings up for sale and as a result, wrote them down to the expected market value, resulting in a non-cash charge of $57 million. We also incurred $10 million in charges related to a reduction in force.  Second, we had $19 million of non-cash charges related to acquisitions, primarily ADE. $10 million is included in COGS, $3 million is included in R&D, $6 million is included in SG&A. In the March quarter, we expect $15 million of charges related to acquisitions. These estimates exclude potential charges for OnWafer, SensArray, and Thermawave, as we have not yet completed the purchase price allocation for these transactions and Thermawave has not yet received the required regulatory approvals.  Third, we had $15 million of expenses related to the stock option investigation. $11 million of compensation costs for the reimbursement of non-executive employees for penalty taxes under IRS section 409-A; and for lost benefits under the company's employee stock purchase plans; and $4 million for legal, accounting, and other costs. We expect to occur approximately $25 million of compensation expenses in the March quarter to resolve the remaining issues related to IRS section 409-A for non-executive employees.  Now, turning to the income statement. Revenue for the December quarter was $649 million, up about 3% quarter to quarter and up 33% from the same quarter last year. Revenue in the quarter was at the low end of our guidance as in order to help one of our customers solve an extremely difficult problem, we delivered a special upgrade to a toolset that we had expected to revenue in the quarter. Since the product solutions as upgraded has not been released, we were not able to take revenue on the tools in the quarter, even though the customer has signed the acceptance for the tools. As a result, approximately $15 million of revenue moved from the December quarter into the March quarter.  Gross margin for the December quarter was 54.4%. This includes $1 million in costs related to the reduction in force; $10 million of charges for acquisitions and deal-related amortization; and $3 million for the reimbursement of penalty taxes for non-executive employees. Excluding these items, gross margin was 56.5%. This is down about 60 basis points from Q1. Half of this decline was from the integration of ADE, which as we told you on the last call would be slightly dilutive to gross margins in the quarter. The balance of this decline was related to the movement of revenue from December to March I discussed earlier, and duplicate costs incurred as a result of the move of one of our products to Singapore. Gross margins excluding share-based compensation was 57.7%.  Operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D, were $275 million. This number includes: $57 million of non-cash charges related to the writedown of buildings; $9 million of costs related to the reduction in force; $9 million of charges for acquisitions and deal-related amortization; $4 million of expenses for investigation costs; and $8 million for reimbursement of penalty taxes for non-executive employees.  Excluding these items, operating expenses for the December quarter were approximately $187 million. This includes a $20 million benefit related to the cancellation of a former executive equity award. Excluding this benefit, operating expenses were $208 million, up approximately $5 million from the prior quarter, as efficiencies realized in the quarter partially offset the increase from the addition of ADE. Excluding stock-based compensation, operating expenses were $179 million.  For the December quarter, other income was $22.7 million. The effective tax rate was 11.5%. This rate was lower than our ongoing tax rate of 28% as a result of the one-time charges in the quarter and the retroactive renewal of the R&D tax credit. For the remaining quarters of fiscal year 2007, we continue to anticipate that our tax rate will be approximately 28%.  Net income for the December quarter was $90 million. Excluding the one-time charges discussed above, net income was $147 million or $0.72 per fully diluted share. This number includes share-based compensation expenses of $0.05 per diluted share and the approximate breakout is as follows: COGS, $0.04; R&D, $0.05; a benefit in SG&A of $0.02 as a result of the cancellation of a former executive’s equity award; and a tax benefit of $0.02.  In the March 2007 quarter, we expect share-based compensation to be about $0.11 per diluted share and the approximate breakout is: COGS, $0.04; R&D, $0.05; SG&A, $0.07 and a tax benefit of $0.05.  Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments at December 31 were $2.1 billion, a decrease of $283 million quarter to quarter. We spent $390 million on the ADE acquisition, in line with our strategy of growing the business through targeted acquisitions.  During the December quarter, our stock repurchase program remained suspended. However, we expect it to resume this Thursday. We paid a dividend of $24 million, inventory increased by $74 million to $565 million, primarily as a result of the ADE integration and increasing shipments to Japan; accounts receivable finished the quarter at $449 million, up $33 million from September, again as a result of the ADE integration and the increase in shipments.  Capital additions were approximately $19 million for the quarter as we continued the construction of our new facility in Asia. Depreciation was $15 million so on a net basis, including retirements and the writedowns of buildings I discussed earlier, fixed assets decreased by $39 million in the quarter.  Headcount ended the December quarter at 6,250 up approximately 400 from September as a result of the ADE acquisition.  Finally, to recap the guidance Rick gave for March, bookings down 5% plus or minus 10%; shipments of about $700 million; revenue between $700 million and $715 million; operating expenses up 1% to 2% which includes approximately $4 million for the addition of OnWafer and SensArray; tax rate of 28%; and EPS, including share-based compensation but excluding one-time charges and deal-related amortization, of $0.76 to $0.79. Deal-related amortization, excluding charges for OnWafer, SensArray and Thermawave is expected to be $14.5 million. In March, we also expect to incur $25 million of compensation expenses to resolve the remaining issues related to IRS Section 409-A for non-executive employees and this guidance does not include Thermawave.  This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call over to Luan to give the polling instructions, let me request that you refrain from asking multi-part questions to give others some time. As always, we're all on a tight schedule. Luan, can you begin the polling, please? 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup. 
 Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup:  Hi, guys. A couple things. First of all, looking at the push outs that the other folks saw recently, it sounds like you didn't see those sort of push outs. I guess as you look out to the June quarter, I know it's difficult, but typically June is up seasonally for you; is there any reason to believe that wouldn't be the case this time? 
John Kispert: On the push outs, what we saw -- I'd say over the last 45 days or so -- is some movement, but I'd call it net zero movement. As you guys all know, there's some JVs that are moving production around joint ventures, from one region to the other. Certainly some folks who are deciding who is going to fund what and when. But I'd say we saw as much stuff pull in as far as shipments are concerned and as much as we saw get pushed out. I'd also characterize this for everybody to make sure they understand this, probably less than 5% of our output that got moved in and out of the quarter.  I think the second quarter part of your question is, yes, if you look over the time, the June quarter is typically up for us. When I say over time, I mean 25 to 30 years; June is the end of our fiscal year for KLA-Tencor, it's our fourth quarter. For whatever reason, that usually drives an uptick in our business. 
 Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: John, just to clarify, you would see that happening this year as well? 
John Kispert:  I think when we do a bottoms up, it looks that way to us today. Yes. 
 Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup:  Okay, John. Thanks a lot. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jay Deahna - JP Morgan. 
 Jay Deahna - JP Morgan: Good morning. John, a question for you. As you look at the demand pattern throughout the year do you see actually a pickup in foundry in IDM in the latter half of the year? Generally speaking, do you think that demand in the second half of the year in terms of orders can be equal to or higher than the first half, given the fact that memory is pretty strong in the first half? 
John Kispert: It's a tough one, Jay. Through the years we try to stay out of the second half of the year as far as predicting in January or February. What I can tell you when we do bottoms up, which is what people are telling us in the categories you're giving me which are foundry, logic and memory, memory certainly looks more front-end loaded. I would characterize the foundry plans today as being starting the beginning of the April/May timeframe and picking up through the second half of the year. I'd also characterize the logic pattern as being that also, which would in both those cases would be back-half loaded versus memory, which looks more front-end loaded today in a bottom up view of what customers are telling us. 
 Jay Deahna - JP Morgan:  Just to follow-up on that, John, how much of the 65-nanometer ultimate build-out has already been done? I mean Intel's done, but I don't think a lot of other people are. So as we move into the back half and into the next year, is 65-nanometer logic a cyclical driver?  Secondly, do you see the development and early stage ramp of 45-nanometer happening simultaneous to that so that at some point there might be a sustainable new cycle out there after this flat stuff for a while, or do you see it differently than that? 
John Kispert: Certainly a 65-nanometer build out, if you will, is the key for the 2007 for KLA-Tencor. We tend to look more at yields, as you guys know. The learning on yields for the majority of the industry are still very low. So there's lots of work to be done there if yields aren’t up. When I say low, well below 50% for most folks. So nobody's going to be adding capacity until you figure out how to get the yields up.  To the first part of your question, we see lots of opportunity not only in logic and foundry there, but with certainly some memory folks throughout the year. And then, 45-nanometer is a great driver for KLA-Tencor. I don't know if we've given you the number yet, but it was about 20%, 25% of our business this last quarter, 45-nanometer.  That R&D investment in those pilot investments will kind of pick up as the year goes on, no doubt, as people try to keep up with the leaders. Certainly that will be a big driver for us as the year goes on. 
 Jay Deahna - JP Morgan:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Just curious as to figure out what you're hearing from your NAND customers; and seeing in the way of orders and shipments, given the weak fundamentals in this part of the market? Any commentary on first half versus second half spend for this segment of your customer base? 
Rick Wallace: John and I were just in Asia last week meeting with customers and spent some time with both NAND, flash, and DRAM customers. Clearly stronger momentum in the DRAM space, as we all know, and it doesn't appear that demand is going to pick up in the near term for that. There are some potential drivers that could kick in for the second half, things like the iPhone, which I think are going to use a lot more NAND.  In general what we're getting a sense of is that DRAM will carry the memory spend and the investment for the remainder of the calendar year. That's kind of how we're modeling it, is we think the DRAM continues to be strong, and as John said, the rest of the industry, foundry and logic picking up in the second half. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley:  Any expectations for NAND coming back in the second half of the year? 
John Kispert:  The way we've looked at it, Harlan, again, bottoms up is it's one-third of the memory spend throughout the year. I think it'll be very lumpy; memory in general is kind of lumpy for us; bigger orders some quarters and then it's quieter for a quarter. But hard to tell exactly as the year unfolds if it's back half or front half or when it is, but as we look at it bottoms up, it's about one-third, maybe a little bit less of the spend through the year. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Great. 
John Kispert: One-third of memory. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley:  One-third of memory. Yes, got it. So with 45-nanometer and below accounting for one-quarter of the bookings, I just wanted to know what your customers are saying about the yield challenges at this particular node? I know it is early days but any feedback would be great. 
Rick Wallace: Very interesting meetings last week as we were going through that with a number of customers and huge concerns about defectivity in terms of managing yield at 45, and so we're getting a lot of pressure. The good news is, I suppose there's huge opportunity for us as we just sat through a litany of challenges people faced. The challenge, of course, is it means we've got to keep bringing out our latest generation products to be able to satisfy those needs, so it puts a lot of pressure on our engineering groups to bring out our latest generation, which is the kind of pressure we want, but it certainly seems to be defectivity is the key to success. We had a number of customers telling us that last week; the ability to find and fix these defects at 45 is going to be just tremendously challenging. 
 Harlan Sur - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jenny Yun - JP Morgan. 
 Jenny Yun - JP Morgan: Good morning. With $2.1 billion of cash and cash equivalent on your balance sheet, what kind of uses are you considering for that and how much do you need to run your business? 
 Jeff Hall: As we look over the past three months, we've used about $500 million of cash for acquisitions. We're restarting our normal buyback on Thursday, we still have about 3.8 million shares authorized on that plan. We have a plan for excess cash beyond this. We're not ready to disclose it today, but we expect to make an announcement of our plans in the relatively near future.  Of course going forward, as we continue to execute on our operating excellence and improvements, we're going to continue to increase our operating cash flow going forward. 
 Jenny Yun - JP Morgan: So you need, you said, $500 million of cash for operations? 
 Jeff Hall:  No, I did not say that. I said we have done about $500 million of acquisitions over the last few months. I didn't say how much cash we actually need for running day-to-day operations. It's not a number we typically talk about. 
 Jenny Yun - JP Morgan: And then for your share buybacks, is that on a matrix or is it just from time to time when you find the opportunities available? 
Rick Wallace:  We don't disclose it, Jenny. 
 Jenny Yun - JP Morgan: Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America Securities. 
 Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America Securities:  With the shutdown of the facilities in the fourth quarter, can you give us an update on how far along you are in terms of this manufacturing transition, moving stuff overseas? 
 Jeff Hall:  Let me just clarify, Mark. We didn't shut down any facilities in the quarter. What we did is we put some facilities on what's called available for sale, which means you write them down to the market value, but we're still using those facilities. We have plans to get out of those facilities as we transition. At this point, we've got some products up and running and we're going to continue that transition in line with our three-year plan. 
 Mark Fitzgerald - Banc of America Securities:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good morning, thanks so much. Question about the fungibility of NAND and DRAM capacity. Do you see NAND capacity getting moved back to DRAM to fix the excess in NAND? If you do, do you think that could have any impact on the planned DRAM orders as we go throughout the year?  What kind of revenue opportunity do you guys see in DRAM versus NAND under that kind of scenario, and are there any big differences between the yield issues that the customers are facing in either one of those segments? Thanks. 
Rick Wallace:  Hi, Jim. Thank you for the question. Fungibility. There's certainly, as you know, some key players out there that service both NAND and the DRAM market and flash and they do have fungibility, but I think those plans are already in place that they've already optimized for what they believe the needs are going forward and so we don't really see… I think John laid out earlier in the call how we see the memory market over the calendar '07.  In terms of yield challenges, there's no question that NAND presses the technology, but DRAM has its own set of challenges and so as I said, when we were meeting with memory customers last week, a lot of concern about the ability to ramp their yields. I would say that equally challenging, both tend to push the technology limits as they try to battle competitively to bring out new technology. So we see both opportunities for us in terms of bringing out yield capabilities.  It's really the other drivers more than the underlying technologies, such as emersion lithography, pushing things, high Ks, there's a number of technologies that are driving the need for better yield management than simply whether it is a DRAM or a flash. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: So you don't perceive any incremental risk to your orders then from more NAND capacity getting moved over to DRAM and that in turn obviating the need for new DRAM orders? 
Rick Wallace:  No, I think we've modeled that in as we go forward. As I said, there's only a few people that can do that because they serve both markets, and that's what we're looking at as we go forward. John, do you want to add anything to that? 
John Kispert:  The only thing, Jim, as you know, your question is somewhat customer-specific. There might be timing issues if a particular customer decides to start moving more capacity off of NAND and on to DRAM as far as an order in a quarter or a capacity expansion or even R&D, but… 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: John, I understand that there are only a few customers that can do it, but those customers collectively represent over half of the NAND market. 
John Kispert:  But we're pretty close with those, Jim; that was the point. 
 Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Sure, sure. Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward White - Lehman Brothers. 
Analyst for Edward White - Lehman Brothers:  Hi guys, this is Dave for Ed. Could you talk a little bit more about 45 nanometers, where you were on terms of your orders for 45 nanometers about six months ago and where you expect to be six months in the future and then 12 months? 
John Kispert:  Six months ago was probably about 10% of our order book. In fact, we probably said it on the conference call. Today, as I just said, it's 20%, 25%. I think it probably stays in that range for most of this year. It's a different set of folks that start investing there over time, so it's a different set of folks every quarter. But in that 20%, 25% range we tend to, at a next technology node, I think most people know we tend to get a bunch of our next generation tools ordered early on in the R&D cycle. 45 nanometer, I think, is a bigger opportunity for process control or inspection of measurements, so I think 25%, maybe up to 30% in the back half of the year, depending on the total. 
Rick Wallace:  Just to give you an example, when 65 got to this level, to John’s point, it took about a year at the same level, so we're modeling 45 in a similar fashion, if that makes sense. 
Analyst for Edward White - Lehman Brothers:  Yes, that makes sense. A question about market share. Just looking at the [WWSens] data, it looks like, depending on how you look at it, you guys gained some share. Can you talk about how you think about that? Do you think that perhaps you are gaining any share and if so, why do you think that is the case? 
Rick Wallace:  We track pretty closely our market position. Our focus is on how do we make sure that we're bringing out the capability that our customers need? I would say that overall, our share pretty much stays kind of where it is. It's been pretty strong in the markets that we've been successful in historically. We've had a lot of people make a run at these markets over time and I think the reason we maintain our position is as a company, we're solely focused on inspection and metrology and we continue to bring out the capabilities; we invest heavily in R&D to do that and we support our customers. I don't see this being a particularly new story. 
John Kispert: At this point in the cycle, Dave, where we are exposed on market, especially around price, are folks that will be investing in 90 nanometer; the trailing edge, if you will. Obviously, that's where our competition is going to come after us, that's going to be the area. The learning is done there, the technologies have been in place for a while, it's more price sensitive. Clearly, at this point in the cycle, that's where we're most focused when it comes to competition and market share. 
Analyst for Edward White - Lehman Brothers:  Very good. Thanks, guys. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch. 
 Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch:  Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit, with four acquisitions in the recent times, what you think these four acquisitions will look like in a couple quarters once they're consolidated? Ballpark percent of revenue and what kind of impact they might have on the margins, if any? Also if you can comment, if the environment out there is still fairly rich in opportunities for you to continue these acquisitions that are close to your product lines and technologies. 
John Kispert: Brett, I will take the first part and Rick will take the second part, kind of how we've divvied up responsibilities. I think ADE, we've talked a bunch about here, Jeff, had them in the prepared remarks, so far so good. It's been very good. Good markets, good technology, good management team. The integration, although any integration is difficult, has gone relatively well and we're happy with the financial return on it. You know the size of it has been a $20 million to $30 million a quarter business and it's actually will be accretive here over the next quarter or two. We're happy with that. We think more and more opportunities with this technology, with our distribution and the challenge we have.  The other two acquisitions, SensArray and OnWafer are two companies we've known for a long time. We've known the management teams for a long time. One company is 20 years old and really adds to our mission, which is critical process control data. As Rick mentioned, it's not just in etch and litho, but also in deposition where we can get unique data essentially around temperature or thermal data and eventually we believe pressure and voltage kind of data that will complement the stuff that we do today. This is a much smaller business, 1% to 2% of KLA-Tencor's top line today. We do think the markets double in the next year or two as you move into 45-nanometer.  It also is complementary to our channel as far as the folks that we sell to and deal with every day. So that business, we believe, will take a little bit longer as far as accretion is concerned, but an opportunity for us to add more and more data, ease of use to our customers as far as controlling their process and production tools.  The fourth one, which is Thermawave, a much different business, as you know, Brett. I think bottom line for Thermawave, a company we've known for a long, long time and competed against for a long time is great technologies as we know, very good synergies with KLA-Tencor, not only in distribution and service and applications, but we know the markets pretty well. They have good products, and as we all know, they have good customers, because they're our customers. There's good synergy there. That will take a little bit longer for accretion, if you will, but we have to get the deal done, first. 
Rick Wallace:  Brett, the second part of your question, the opportunities that are out there, there are a number of opportunities as we focus on inspection and measurement in our core markets we serve today and in adjacent markets. We're monitoring those closely as we always have. I think the key to these is to maintain the right discipline, to make sure the valuations that one uses and pays for companies make sense in a relatively short order that we're not counting hugely on synergies, but that we see both the opportunities to fill out our product portfolio and as well to essentially create growth opportunities for us.  In some cases like the ADE, one of the real attractive aspects of that deal was that they had a product line which they really couldn't access a different part of the market with so it was a way for us to bring it in and we believe we'll be able to grow from there. It is a key part of our strategy going forward.  These happened to be available at the time we were looking at it, but we're going to continue to work the pipeline. I think we can continue to grow through acquisition if we're careful and thoughtful about it. 
John Kispert:  The key, obviously, Brett, is our execution on each one of these and we're very focused on that. 
 Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch:  Thank you. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse Securities:  Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to get back to this question of fungibility and DRAM capacity. When I look at the industry out there, there are probably two or three companies that can actually make this transition, but if you look at the installed capacity, what they have is a lot of NAND capacity still sitting on 200 millimeter, which they converted from DRAM to NAND two or three years ago when NAND margins were higher.  My question is, how much longer do you think this 200 millimeter platform can actually continue to produce cutting edge memory, particularly given all of the new things we are seeing with the DRAM industry so far? 
Rick Wallace:  I think you bring up a very good point, Satya. I think the 200 millimeter NAND capability struggles as they get to the next node. In discussions with those very customers you're talking about over the last week or so, they're counting on the ability to get to 300 millimeter. I think that you're right that the 200 will play out, but part of the growth story in memory has been this transition to 300 millimeter. That will continue as that just has higher productivity than 200. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse Securities:  Did you give an outlook for orders in March by device, by memory, foundry, and logic? 
Rick Wallace:  We didn't. We see it pretty similar to what we saw; memory still at the 55% range, with the split we talked about with NAND being maybe one-third of that. Logic, a little bit less, a little bit lighter at 25%, and foundry, a little bit up, closer to 20% range. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse Securities: If I try to reconcile that with what you seem to be saying for June, I think you mentioned that at this point based on June orders look up, but at the same time I think you mentioned that shipments are first half loaded for memory, which means at some point in September and December you start to see shipments from memory decline pretty substantially.  If that's the case, shouldn't you see orders for memory decline in the June quarter given that orders should lead shipments by a quarter? In other words, if you're seeing June more flat to up, how do you see memory orders trending into the June quarter? Shouldn't you be seeing June down at this point? 
Rick Wallace: Yes. I think you see foundry get bigger in June, at least that's what we see in the funnel today. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse Securities: Is that foundry going to completely offset any declines in memory in June, is that the way you see it? 
Rick Wallace: Today, that's how we see it. 
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse Securities: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Hi guys. Just looking at your guidance here, if I look at 700 and 715, $0.76 and $0.79, and I look at my model, a consensus of 679 and $0.73 it looks like most of your upside to consensus in my model is coming from the top line here. Can you describe what it will take to start driving more massive earnings leverage at the bottom line with all of this restructuring going on? Is there a little bit of a longer tail, or do we need to restructure a little bit more here to see more meaningful leverage on R&D and SG&A and that kind of stuff? 
John Kispert: On the bottom line, we've talked about getting out of some of our unprofitable product lines over the last couple of quarters and that takes a while. The key there for us is to not hurt our customers. So that you'll see unwinding over the next quarter or two.  I guess your question is the fixed costs of R&D and SG&A, does that come down over time? The biggest issue we have there is, as we've been able to move more and more of that to lower cost regions or to tamper it, we've added these three acquisitions now and then potentially a fourth. How do you consolidate those over the next three to four quarters and leverage the R&D and SG&A? We're confident we can do it.  The way I look at it, if we can execute over the next three to four quarters, it's relatively flat if not down a little bit relative to the top line. But the real leverage, as you pointed out, is in our gross margin. The key there for us over the next couple quarters is our cycle times. We have a lot of backlog we have to ship. The teams are focused on this. We're fortunate we can still take our cycle times down at this point in the ramp after a couple of quarters. I still think we can take our cycle times down by another 30% across the company, and that will continue to add leverage in the gross margin. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: So, John, just to review, a lot of numbers flying around in the quarter, but that $10 million risk in terms of severance charges, is that mostly for your ADE division or acquisition? 
John Kispert: Some of it was ADE and some of it was some management levels here in San Jose. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: When you look at your guidance for the March quarter, you obviously guided to some in-process R&D charges. Any more restructuring or severance charges we should be modeling here in the March quarter? 
John Kispert:  Don't anticipate any related expenses in the March quarter. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: So we're kind of fine here with SG&A running around the $105 million range. That's not going to come down appreciably or stepping down anytime soon? 
Rick Wallace:  It's about flat. 
 Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Just what John said. Perfect. Thanks, guys. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Suresh Balaraman - ThinkEquity. 
 Suresh Balaraman - ThinkEquity Partners:  With the acquisition of Thermawave, do you guys have some thoughts on how large the optical CD SIMM can get for you? This has been talked about as a very large market as you have talked about CD SIMM. I'm wondering, are there any hurdles that can be controlled by the acquisition as opposed to just a market adoption? 
Rick Wallace:  Yes, I think that the optical CD position that we have, we're in a good position and we definitely have seen good growth in that. Clearly there are some opportunities for some synergy with the Thermawave, but our optical CD strategy does not count on the Thermawave technology to execute.  I think our challenges are more fundamental, which is, we've got to meet our customer needs as they push their new design rules requiring us to bring out new algorithms and new capability to model these smaller devices. So it's more of a function of that. There may be some technology IP that we pick up, but we're actually not counting on that to execute on our optical market. 
John Kispert:  The opportunities, Suresh, are around the newer architectures and newer materials at 45 nanometer. That's where the opportunities are, and less around the two companies. 
 Suresh Balaraman - ThinkEquity Partners:  Can you put some numbers on it, how big can it with be? $100 million, $500 million, $1 billion? People have talked about a $1 billion opportunity, but I'm just wondering, what can it potentially get to? 
Rick Wallace:  I think that the overall CD market is a pretty good-sized market and relatively slow growing, except for the optical CD part. I think there are more opportunities to grow that. It really is fundamentally a question of how many layers can you take from the CD measurements and put them on optical CD. To some degree the technology solutions we come up with can drive how large that market can become. We've got opportunities to grow it, but we've got to execute in order to do it. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mahesh Sanginario - RBC Capital Markets. 
Mahesh Sanginario - RBC Capital Markets : A quick question on the bottom line. If I continue to model, say $700 million in revenues going forward for the next three or four quarters, where can I expect the EPS upside could come from? Will it be from restructuring, share buyback? How should it trend for next four quarters? 
Rick Wallace: You're going to see us continue to execute on our operating goals, so as we see revenue at about 700 to 715, operating expenses flat, up a little bit as a result of the OnWafer SensArray acquisition. We'll see gross margin tick up a little bit as we go forward into the next quarter as we get through some of the issues we had in this quarter.  Right now in guidance, we are modeling share count at flat. So if it goes down from there, we'll see some benefit as well. 
Mahesh Sanginario - RBC Capital Markets :  You don't see for the next four quarters a substantial uptick in the EPS numbers at current revenue levels? 
Rick Wallace: Mahesh, I don't intend to give guidance for the next four quarters. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Steve O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank. 
 Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Good morning. Two questions. First in a flat CapEx environment, how much can KLA grow in 2007? Second, can you give us an update on the joint venture with DNS on electrolyte deposition? 
 Jeff Hall:  I'll take those in reverse order. Let me start with the DNS one. When we announced last year that we were going to focus on inspection of antrology, part of what that meant was that we were not going to focus on process. We had a joint venture which we then started the process of unwinding, so we are now through that process and that joint venture has now been retired. It was successful in the sense that we brought out some interesting technology, but it was really for future nodes, so that is behind us.  In terms of our ability to grow in a flat market, as I've said, we've modeled it from zero to 5% growth for overall revenues and CapEx in 2007 and we see the ability for the KLA-Tencor to grow faster than that. We think probably 5% points faster than that as we go throughout 2007. 
 Steve O’Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FBR. 
 Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: Going back to the margin profile, if you could clarify, if I exclude the option expenses, I come up with a 60% gross and around 30% operating margin. My question in that regard is, is that the peak margins you're seeing, or is there still leverage left? If you could help us quantify this leverage.  With regard to revenue guidance, how much of the March quarter revenue comes from Thermawave? 
John Kispert: I'll let Jeff take the last part of the question. When it comes to modeling gross margin and operating margin, what we do here is focus every quarter on just improving it. We try not to set a goal or a target internal to the company because goals and targets, once you make those goals and targets, people tend to stop. We just keep trying to up the bar.  So it is a really difficult question for us to answer pointing into the future. I think if you look at our history, you're probably not far off, but there's no way internally we are going to say that's where we're going to stop. 
 Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: But are we talking about a low single-digit upside expansion from here? 
John Kispert: Like I said, we're going to keep trying to push it higher. I'm not going to tell you what, because I have to idea. We think we can keep doing better and we are going to keep trying to do better. 
 Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey:  How about on the OpEx side, should we assume on a dollar base, is this operating expansion going to remain flat, or is it going to increase? Can you help us understand to what extent? 
 Jeff Hall:  Mehdi, operating expense, I said, was basically flat, up 1% to 2% as a result of the addition of On Wafer and SensArray. But I think the right assumption here is it's flat, it's not going up.  Thermawave, the other part of the your question, Thermawave is not included in guidance. 
 Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: Thank you. 
Operator:  Our next question comes from Stephen Chin - UBS. 
 Stephen Chin - UBS: Good morning. Thank you. In terms of the operating expenses, is the company still hiring for the core KLA business? Secondly, if you were to exclude some of these acquisitions like Thermawave and the two other small pending acquisitions, would you expect the core KLA headcount levels to be up sequentially at the end of the March quarter? 
 Jeff Hall: We're always looking for good people. If we can find a good person, we'll bring them in. But I would think core KLA-Tencor is flat to down in headcount, especially locally here. 
 Stephen Chin - UBS: Thanks. In terms of orders by geography for the March quarter, which regions do you think might deviate from the historical average in the March quarter? 
John Kispert: The U.S. looks to us to be a little bit down for the March quarter, that's just timing. It ran about 20% the last couple of quarters and I think it will probably be down closer to 10% of the total in the March quarter. The offset to that is Japan will pop back up to around 30%. I think we see Taiwan, Korea, China, and the rest of Asia, their typical percentage is flat to where they were last quarter.  I think there's some opportunities in Europe again, just timing for the March quarter that would pop Europe up to closer to 15% in the March quarter. 
Operator:  Your next question comes from Robert Maire – Needham & Co. 
 Robert Maire - Needham & Co.:  We're going through a number of technology transitions or likely transitions this year, such as copper starting to come into memory and double printing on litho. How does that impact your mix of products of overlay versus wafer inspection versus other products that you put out there? Any significant changes in mix that we can expect? 
Rick Wallace:  Hi, Robert. Thanks for the question. There are some challenges out there, as you mentioned, copper coming into memory, double patterning, emersion lithography, IK. There are a lot of technology changes that are pushing our customers and they're pushing the demands in both the metrology space where the need to measure and control these materials is very important as well as the defectivity, where the integration of new materials and the challenges associated with that.  So I would say, just to give you a couple of specifics, double patterning, as it comes into being, pushes the overlay requirement specifically creating really a driver for our new technology, the Archer 100, to be able to go in and serve that market and we see that continuing to grow as a result. Also, emersion creates challenges with the edge of the wafer, which is something that our VisEdge product addresses.  In addition to just the overall defectivity challenges presented by those and by copper, we see both demands for metrology and inspection going up. Again, part of our overall thesis is that inspection of metrology will outgrow the market as new technologies continue to come on. So we're very bullish and we think challenges are broad-based in terms of the portfolio that we have and how those will address the challenges. 
 Robert Maire - Needham & Co.: A quick follow-up, I may have missed it, but any update on your data storage side of your business or any strategic changes there? What's the direction of that part of the business? 
John Kispert: It's going well. As you probably know and I think most people know, it's not a part of our world where there's an incredible amount of investment right now, but it's a pretty steady business for us.  What we've done with ADE and with some of the other acquisitions is leverage that part of the business into other markets like high brightness LEDs, like not only the substraight and media, but also optical electronics, compound semis. So that business, we call it our growth and emerging business, is seeing an uptick the last couple of quarters, but I think generally the demand in that space is relatively flat.  We're planning on it being relatively flat the next quarter or two. We're trying to make our own way there as far as penetrating new applications, just like we do in the semi industry.  It's possible to see some pick up, but it's a small percentage of our business. 
 Robert Maire - Needham & Co.:  Okay, just curious. Thank you very much. 
 Jeff Hall:  Luan, we've got time for one more question. 
Operator:  Okay, sir. Your final question comes from Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest. 
 Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities: Hi, thanks, guys. John or Rick, when looking at SensArray here and On Wafer, these products appear to be quite different from what you already have on the market. Just wondering, are these acquired technologies? Do you look to integrate these into your current product lines, or will these be new product categories for you? In other words, what was the thought process behind making these acquisitions? 
John Kispert: I thought I said earlier that the thought process is pretty simple in that it adds more critical process control data to our suite. Organizationally, the divisions are going to report into our service organization.  Why is that? Because that's where we're closest to touching the preventive maintenance on process tools, the fixes that you do to process tools, because that's generally where you use these, as you probably know, these are wafers both wired and wireless wafers that you use to monitor process tools.  As you know, there's a handful of our products that do exactly the same thing. So it's a complementary set of data points that our customers can use.  I’d also say when it comes to SensArray and On Wafer, we're uniquely positioned in the industry in that these wafers are also bought by our sister companies, if you will, in the process space. So the process and litho guys also buy these to do their own development and their own testing. So KLA-Tencor, with our position in the industry, can kind of act as the arbiter of that and we can sell to everybody as well as sell to the semi guys and make sure that the data is getting used throughout the line and patched up and down the line with our software. Does that help? 
 Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities:  It does. Thanks so much. One follow-up for either you or Rick as well. I believe that AMAT’s UVision has made some in-roads against KT in the logic here in the U.S. I'm just wondering, can you talk about the merits behind the decision process here and how the competitive front might have changed with the newest version of UVision now on the market? 
John Kispert: I don't know who you're referring to. On the competitor front, as Rick said earlier, we don't see much of a change here, we've always had competition in our Darkfield product space as well as our Brightfield. Our market share on the leading edge is as strong, if not better, as it has been in the last 10 to 15 years. As I said earlier, where we're challenged at this point in the cycle is when folks are investing more at the trailing edge, which in this case would be 90 nanometer, you'll see more of our competitors' tools pop in there, because it really gets down to more of a price decision. KLA-Tencor's lead in technologies aren't as high at 90-nanometer as they are at 65-nanometer, obviously.  But I don't see a change in our market share. You're picking a particular customer, which I don't know which one it is, but no big change in total market share, particularly at leading edge. 
 Mark Bachman - Pacific Crest Securities:  Thanks so much. 
 Jeff Hall:  Thank you all for participating on the conference call today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. 
Operator:  This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Derrick and I will be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor 2007 conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a Question and Answer Session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Derrick. Good afternoon and welcome to KLA-Tencor's First Quarter 2007 Conference Call. I am Jeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer and joining me on our call today is Rick Wallace our CEO and John Kispert our President and COO. We're here today to discuss results for the period ended September 30, 2006. We released these results this afternoon at approximately 1:15 p.m. Pacific time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find a copy of on our website, www.kla-tencor.com or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today’s call with a discussion of industry developments and KLA-Tencor's progress and strategy. Afterwards I will review selected financial results for the first quarter and then I will open the call for questions until approximately 3:00 Pacific Time. On the investor section of our website, you will find a simulcast of this call which will be accessible on demand for replay. On the website you will also find a calendar for invest or events and presentations at investor conferences. You will also find links to KLA-Tencor's security filings. In those filings you will find description of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risk. Any forward-looking statements we make are subject to those risks. KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee that those forward-looking comments will come true, and although we take no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you can be assured any updates we do make will be broadly disseminated and available over the web. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that as we’ve previously announced, we are in the process of restating our financial statements and expect to record non-cash, share-based compensation charges that are not anticipated to exceed $400 million. Let me also remind you that as a result of the pending restatement we are you unable to provide detailed GAAP or non-GAAP financials for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. On this call we will not be able to provide any specifics about our gross margin, operating expenses, inventory, taxes, or other item that might be affected by share-based compensation. All numbers for the first quarter discussed on this call are not final and should be considered estimates. Let me also remind you that we recently announced the special committees investigation is nearly complete. We are now starting to get the data we need to begin the restatement process and the team here is geared up and working hard to complete the restatement as soon as possible. There is still a substantial amount of work to be done. Remember we are looking at 40 quarters of data from time periods up to ten years ago. We need to determine not only what share-based accounting charges should be, but also how those charges impact cost of goods sold, inventory, R&D, SG&A, taxes, and many other income statement and balance sheet items. In addition, as you know, we converted to one common ERP system about two years ago. Because the time periods in question are up to ten years in the past, we have to retrieve data from multiple legacy ERP systems which are no longer in use. As a result of these factors, we are currently targeting to be complete with the restatement process in January. With that, I will turn it over to Rick.
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer, Director: Thank you, Jeff, and thank you for joining our quarterly call for the first quarter of FY '07. Today I will be discussing the highlights for the September quarter and guidance for the December quarter, updates on key product activity, and an update on our ADE acquisition. In the September quarter the Company continued doing well strategically, technologically and financially. As you already know, with the pending restatement there is a limited amount of financial information we can disclose at this time. The Company has continued to focus on executing our strategy which is producing excellent financial results. Let me start with the quick rundown of the numbers, and then I will provide my perspective on them. Orders for the September quarter were $647 million, down 20%. Revenue was $630 million, and shipments were $652 million. Remember September orders are typically down 10% to 15%. They were lower than our outstanding June quarter but $647 million continues to show the strength of KLA-Tencor's broad process control business. Memory customers made up 46% of the orders, down from 60% in the June quarter. Logic customers were also strong making up about a third of our orders, and Japan was our single largest booking region at 35% of orders. The quarter continued to show the critical need for yield management and process control to ramp 90-nanometer production, to drive yield improvement at 65-nanometer, and to get 45-nanometer into product qualifications. More than one customer reported a significant benefit from our yield management capability. For example, a major memory customer saw critical yield limiting defects in three key process steps around the transistor utilizing our Brightfield 2800, resulting in a 20% yield improvement. This is the benefit we strive to deliver and are always please to hear when it is being realized. The outlook for December shows memory staying steady, particularly in Taiwan and Korea and strength in logics. We see some shift in capacity occurring from NAND flash to DRAM which we believe can have a short-term impact on bookings as customers qualify fabs before ramping. From our perspective, we continue to see a healthy semi industry but with some softness in specific markets. Current projections are for semi revenues to be up 7% to 10% in 2006 and 2007. Fab utilization levels continue strong, and we are still tracking 17 new 300 mm fabs schedule to qualify by the end of 2007. The well understood story is NAND bit growth. What is now emerging is strong DRAM bit growth for 2007. Let me now give you a couple of updates on our product activity. Our latest Brightfield defect inspection system, the 2800 broadband tool continue to demonstrate its superiority, and sensitivity, defect capture and speed. Over the last quarter we saw continued adoption of the 2800 series system across a broad customer base. This has been and continues to be a strong product area of the company. We are particularly excited over the performance of our latest Darkfield inspection tools, the Puma 9110 and 9130. These systems utilize our new streak inspection technology and deliver significantly greater performance. The two tool solution enables our customers to optimize the cost of inspection. In the September quarter we saw it happened market validation of our unique two-tool solution. On October 12th we completed the ADE acquisition. We are excited to have this team in business opportunity now be a part of KLA-Tencor. ADE's products are critical to the control and yield management of silicon wafer production. We anticipate strong growth in silicon wafer manufacturing as the semiconductor industry continues its conversion to 300 mm and as other markets such as solar become a larger consumer of silicon wafers. We are now focused on a successful integration of ADE and continued support of our new customers. The industry focused on strengths is continuing to 65-nanometer and below now accounting for 55% of our business. Yield at 65-nanometer sincerely still in the steep learning part of the curve with most customers still well below 50% yield. 45-nanometers starting qualification and the problems and challenges will be significant. We are actively working with customers on multiple aspects of 45-nanometer adoption such as transistor engineering and immersion lithography. As always we have a number of new products under development and plan several new product introductions over the next several months that are critical to 45-nanometer. Wrapping up, let me give you our projections for December including ADE. Orders up 10% plus or minus 10%. Revenue up between $650 million and $675 million. The Company is strongly positioned to continue the growth in yield management and process control by enabling our customers to go meet their challenging business needs. The technical challenges faced by our customers are daunting, and our products play a key role in overcoming the hurdles. 2006 is shaping up to be a very good year, and at this time the fundamentals for 2007 continue to look solid. Memory logic and foundry business all have sound under pinnings, and the push to advance the latest technology is unabated. We have continued to execute on our business and look forward to having a complete discussion of our results in the near future. Now I will turn the call back over to Jeff Hall.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Rick. As Rick mentioned for the September quarter net bookings were 647 million, this is at the bottom end of our guidance range as a result of orders in Asia that moved into the first part of the December quarter. As you know, every quarter we review our backlog in detail and book in accordance with our booking policy that restricts actual booking to the set criteria. The set criteria mandate that technical specifications are signed off, valid terms and conditions are finalized and delivery is scheduled within twelve months. This quarter there were no orders debooked as customer orders and shipments scheduled remained firm. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of backlog for unshipped orders. Remember, we do not include any service, contract, consignment, or unreleased systems in this backlog number. In addition, we have $503 million of revenue backlog related to products that have been shipped but not yet signed off by customers. It does not include service revenue and is made up of tools delivered but awaiting written acceptance from the customer. Our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain high profitability throughout any business cycle. Since this is the first quarter of a new fiscal year for us, we have updated the five-year averages we use for bookings comparisons. The regional distribution of orders for the September quarter was as follows: The U.S. was 20%, lower than its historical average of 25%, Taiwan with 10%, lower than its historical average of 20%, Korea, China and Singapore combined were 22%, higher than their historical average of 20%, Europe was 13%, higher than its historical average of 10%, and Japan was 35%, higher than its historical average of 25%. The product distribution of orders was wafer inspection at 52%, reticle inspection was 16%, metrology was 15%, data storage was 2%, and service was 15%. Now let me turn to the income statement. As Rick said, revenue for the quarter was $630 million, up 9% quarter-to-quarter and up 30% from the same quarter last year. Operating margins for the quarter excluding share-based compensation met or exceeded our internal targets for the quarter in most areas as our team continued to execute well driving continued cycle time and cost improvements. Other income for the quarter was 22 million as the interest rate earned on our portfolio increased. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments increased by 100 million quarter-to-quarter after paying a dividend of $24 million. Cash ended the quarter at $2.4 billion, and as Rick noted, on October 12th we closed the ADE transaction which reduced cash to $2.05 billion. We believe that this level of cash is more than we need to run the business and have been working diligently with our board to determine the optimal capital structure. We're looking forward to announcing and executing on our plan once our restatement process complete. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at 415 million, down 25 million from June as a result of strong collections. Capital additions related to fixed assets were approximately 12 million for the quarter and depreciation was 14 million. On a net basis including retirements, fixed assets decreased by 1.5 million over the quarter. Head count ended the December quarter at 5,944, up 40 from June, primarily to support our production increases, field support and new product introductions. The majority of this increase was for people at customer sites at our new manufacturing facility in Asia. As you know, we are currently in the process of integrating ADE into KLA-Tencor. We're learning more about their financials every day, and based on the preliminary assessment of how we will integrate their financials into ours, we believe the integration will have several impacts on the December and future financial statements. First, ADE is a profitable and well-run business, and as a result we expect it to be immediately accretive to our earnings excluding deal-relate charges. Second, we are in the process of assessing the fair value of all the assets and liabilities of the acquired business and preparing the detailed purchase price allocation. We expect to record both one-time accounting charges related to the acquisition as well as have ongoing non-cash charges for the amortization of intangibles. We will cover the details of these charges when we have finalized the amounts on our next quarterly call. Finally, as Rick said our guidance is, orders expected up 10% plus or minus 10% and revenue expected to be between $650 million and $675 million. This guidance includes ADE for the period from October 13th to December 31st. For this time period our current estimates for ADE are bookings for the partial quarter are expected to be approximately 30 million, revenue for the partial quarter is expected to be approximately $20 million. Gross margin is expected to be slightly dilutive to KLA-Tencor margins. R&D, SG&A are expected to be approximately $10 million. We are integrating this business into KLA-Tencor and will not break out these numbers in future quarters. This concludes our remarks on the quarters. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call over to Derrick to give the polling instruction, let me request that you refrain from asking multipart questions to give others some time, as always, we are all on a tight schedule. So, Derrick, can you begin the polling, please?
Operator: Your firs t question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Hi guys, a couple of things. First of all, when you look at bookings in the September quarter, they came in 5% less than what you thought they would, and when you strip out ADE, it looks like they're a smij less than December what you were thinking as well, so what change during the last few weeks, what customer group changed, maybe at the end of September, and what's your outlook for that particular customer group into December? Thanks.
John H. Kispert: It was for the September question, it was order that went right down to the last few moments of the quarter, and we actually booked it already into the December quarter. That was the 5% difference in the September quarter. Going into December and that by the way was foundry in Asia. Going into the December quarter, if there has been a change in the last 30 days, and I think there has been, it’s has been around certainly around NAND. We see some of the projects that we had been working on just getting slightly smaller. I don't think there is a big change, but we've seen that slow down right now looks as though – and is probably affecting us a little bit in our guidance for the December quarter.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: So, I guess, John, it is not that the projects are pushing out, it is that the opportunities a little bit smaller, is that -- 
John H. Kispert: Yes.
Timothy Arcuri – Citigroup: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Hsueh with CIBC World Markets.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Thanks for taking my question. Quick question here, I think we're in a little bit of uncharted territory. You guys are kind of sustainably running at backlog levels roughly a billion dollars. Assuming you can sustain a billion dollars kind of backlog level for unshipped orders, what's sort of the natural steady state shipment number and I guess more importantly what is the natural kind of steady state revenue number we should be kind of looking at here?
Jeffrey Hall: Gary, it’s Jeff Hall. The way we run the business, we've been doing it this way for a long time. We keep five to six months of unshipped backlog and we keep three to four months of revenue backlog, and so with our billion dollars that we have today and 500 million of revenue backlog, if you keep modeling us that way, you will end up -- depends on where you think orders are going to end up, but as you model that through, you can end up with a pretty reasonable estimation of where we're going to be and of course these numbers all exclude the service which is about a $100 million a quarter for us these days.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay Jeff, I guess there is a lot you can do here with the numbers. Looking at what could be backlog levels at the end of December, I could hit anything from a 700 to 750 in terms of revenue. Is that too high or is my math wrong?
John H. Kispert: Gary, it is a function of deliveries to our customers and where they're ramping. I would think from what we see today, if we look at the installations that we have in front of thaws we see shipments and installations going up in the December quarter, we actually see them going up again in the March quarter, so that backlog should work down that given those dates today, and let's just assume we hold orders flat which I don't know if that's going to be what happens, but we have to deliver that stuff over the next six to nine months.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. It sounds like shipments rising in March; there is a lot of fuel here to drive revenue levels higher from your guidance for December.
John H. Kispert: Certainly if shipments go up, revenues should go up, too, but I would caution you that it is driven more by what our customers needs are and when they sign off on these things, and our ability to predict it.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Maire with Needham.
Robert Maire – Needham: Two quick questions. You‘d mentioned you expect to get the restatements done by January. Can you remind us as to the current deadline for filing with Nasdaq or what the status of discussions with Nasdaq are and a follow-up to a previous question, you had guided to flat to up 10% so if we back out the 5% for ADE that gets added in, that would be flat plus a minus 5%, is that the right way of thinking about it?
John H. Kispert: Robert, I will take the second question. The way I look at it is without ADE we probably up slightly 5%, somewhere between flat and up 5% in the middle of the range today. You add ADE in, it is up 10% middle of the range. Does that make sense?
Robert Maire – Needham: Got it. Very good. 
Jeffrey Hall: You know, this is Jeff Hall. On Nasdaq it is pretty much working out exactly the way we told you on the last call. We certainly been in discussion with Nasdaq, and keep working through the process with them. They know our timing on the restatement, and we expect to be done in January and don't expect to have any issues.
Robert Maire – Needham: Is it open ended or is there a specific date they have in mind? 
Jeffrey Hall: There is not a hard date at this point. It is a process based on a whole bunch of different factors.
Robert Maire – Needham: Okay. So if then beyond the January date, they're okay with that so far?
Jeffrey Hall: Yes, yes.
Robert Maire – Needham: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Deahna with JP. Morgan.
RJ - JP. Morgan: Good afternoon. This is RJ calling in for Jay. A couple of questions. First one regarding the outlook. Given your visibility, can you give us some idea of what the volume ramp looks like for 65-nanometer logic going forward? What kind of time frame do you see and what would be the breadth or strength of that volume ramp up?
John H. Kispert: RJ, was there a second part to your question?
RJ - JP. Morgan: Yes. The second part is as you move towards that, give us some color about if you're seeing any kind of ASP progression. Are you seeing higher ASP's going to 65-nanometer.
John H. Kispert: Great questions, RJ. I think on the first one we certainly see 65-nanometer continuing to ramp, and I think we talked about earlier in the call the fact that what we see there is people are still pushing hard on yield, and so there is opportunities ahead of us to help our customers ramp their yield. At the same time they certainly see a lot of demand for 65-nanometers. So, we think continued ramp over the next several quarters of 65-nanometer. I think the other part of the question, the second part was ASP growth. We are seeing strong performance of our newer products, so those continue to demand strong ASP's, and I think our competitive position demonstrates the fact that not only are we maintaining strong share, but we're also able to realize that value from a customer perspective, so we do see ASP's continuing to be strong as we support 65-nanometer, and of course our latest generation products like the 2800 and the Puma that we talked about earlier play strongly into the 65-nanometer ramps, not just for logic but certainly logic is a big part of that.
RJ - JP. Morgan: So does that mean we would see orders maybe in Q1 of '07 calendar Q1? 
John H. Kispert: For the 65.
RJ - JP. Morgan: Yeah, volume. 
John H. Kispert: We're already seeing some of those and continue to ramp, I think about half our orders now are 65 and below. So absolutely we're seeing some volume. As you know, there is a long tail. Some people are doing 65 earlier than others, and the other ones are coming on but absolutely that's where we're seeing orders from.
RJ - JP. Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Hi. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the relative strength in bookings in Japan, whether that was just sort of lumpiness in the quarter or something unusual going on there, and then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the relative difficulty for semiconductor manufacturers, whether the 65-nanometer cycle seems to be more difficult or the 45-nanometers and as you look at it from a yield standpoint, which do you think is going to be more challenging and present more opportunity?
John H. Kispert: Thanks for the questions. Japan -- Japan just continues to be a strong region for us, and I think there are a couple of reasons for that. Not the least of which is the wafer manufacturers continue to invest as they see demand for 300 mm wafers, and of course a big part of our wafer business comes out of Japan. The other part of that is the reticle manufacturing, and we see continued interest in pushing new capability for our reticle manufacturers as they bring on the latest technology nodes, and finally the wafer semiconductor manufacturers themselves are spending, so Japan was a strong region, and I don't think it was just lumpiness, I think it just showed overall strength in those three verticals that we're in. The other question about the yield transition, the early signs are 45-nanometer is going to be significantly more challenging than 65, and it is still early because people are just starting to qual some of their processes around, and we don't even see full flow yet on 45-nanometer. But no question, some of the challenges associated with the new lithography tools coming on, immersion technologies and some of the new materials, I think there is definitely opportunity for us to help our customers solve some of those problems. So we think 45. We're encouraged by the opportunities in 45-nanometer, but 65 is where the bulk of the investments are right now.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Great. Thank you.
John H. Kispert: Thanks, Ed. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Peter - Steven O'Rourke: Hi. This is Peter for Steven O'Rourke. I had a question about your backlog. Can you give us a composition of how much of your backlog is from memory and if you could, what do you expect the percentage of shipments going forward to lean more favorably towards memory or do you expect memory shipment to say roll off as further you go out?
John H. Kispert: Hey, Peter, John Kispert. I don't have an analytical answer for you. I can do it more by feel. Generally the memory shipments are more time sensitive, and so the delivery dates are sooner and quicker, quicker turns in the manufacturing and installation business, so although memory as you know has been roughly 50% of our business, 40% to 55% of our business, 60% of our business last year, it is tough to get generally turned much quicker, and that's what I would suggest to you over the next quarter or two. I would tell you as a rule it’s generally foundry and foundry can play in the same model except that's not ramping right now, and logic probably a little bit longer lead time over a long period of time, logic probably space in our backlog a little bit longer. Is that all right?
Peter - Steven O'Rourke: Yep.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Good evening, guys, thanks so much. Couple of quick questions. Jeff, you mentioned on the balance sheet 2 billion plus is a little bit more than you think you need to run the business. Any idea what level you think is more appropriate to run the business, and then as you've worked with the Board to work through the ideas, any thoughts on the best Avenues of returning cash to shareholders?
Jeffrey Hall: Thanks, Jim, good question. As we look at capital structure and what's right for KLA-Tencor, really three different things we're looking at. First is what is the cash generation through the various cycles. Obviously in history we've been very profitable, generated a lot of cash and doing a lot of things to really drive the profitability higher going forward, so cash generation looks good going forward. Next big issue is uses of cash. As you know, Jim, we're not very capital intensive. But we do see some interesting targeted growth opportunities. I think ADE is a great example hereof a chance to use our cash to grow the top line and in an immediately accretive way. Finally, how do you put those two things into a model to determine the optimal cash structure for KLA-Tencor. That's something we've been spending a lot of time on here internally, and certainly have been through numerous scenarios and theories and thoughts with our Board and working through what we think the optimal capital structure is. You know, we haven't exactly finalized 100% on the execution plan, so I don't really want to preannounce here, but I think it is a reasonably safe bet that cash is coming down pretty significantly from where we are today. As soon as we get through the restatement, you will see us come out with an announcement about what we're going to do and start executing on it and driving us to what we think is a more optimal structure.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. And then just real quick, around related to the same topic, what kind of for modeling purposes, what kind of increase in OpEx should we be thinking about that you either will have had or will have around the cost of the options investigation because it sounds like obviously it is a pretty intensive situation?
Jeffrey Hall: So, Jim, we took an accrual for expenses back in our June quarter. It is the way we do things here, our accounting policy is to come out and accrue for the next twelve months of expenses, so we took a number there, and we think that's going to be the extent of the charges as we go through there and don't expect a big over hang going forward for several quarters.
Jim Covello - Goldman Sachs: Terrific. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen & Co.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Co: Jeff in the answer to your last question you talked about opportunities to drive leverage higher and increase cash generation, et cetera, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about what some of the activities are in the short-term that you're pursuing to drive better leverage and perhaps just to make the compare easier, talk about what you think the opportunity is from a gross margin, maybe operating margin perspective on revenue similar to the last quarter you fully reported, how much better you think margins would be say a year from now after some of this restructuring?
John H. Kispert: Hey, Raj, John Kispert. Do you find if I answer it.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Co: No. Great.
John H. Kispert: We've been evaluating and piloting a number of things over the last year or so, and we're now definitely seeing financial benefits as well as operational benefits and then frankly cultural benefits. I would also say we now have fairly healthy respect for the risks of poor execution on some things, so we've begun in the last couple of months really to accelerate on a number of fronts and off the top of my head I will list a few of them off to you. The first one is we're aligning our management, what we call our management profile, spans of controls, we definitely want to flatten the organization, and we're going to be doing more of that, and take out layers globally, and so we're executing on that. Another big effort has been aligning our service absent sales organization to mirror the customer base as the customer base moves around and making that more efficient. That is in full force. As we've discussed in the past calls we're moving investment in manufacturing and development capabilities to low cost regions, and we talked to you about India and China, Singapore, Malaysia, and of course Moscow where we have different development efforts and different manufacturing efforts ramping now. We've moved to smaller facilities across the Company, and that will continue as we can make our footprint a little bit smaller and more efficient. We've moved a lot of our -- and begining to move more of our non-core functions to these low cost regions. We're accelerating our volume with these overseas suppliers that we've been working with as we talked about in the past we've moved our supply base to low cost regions, and now we're accelerating the volume, and I think we're feeling real comfortable with the quality and reliability we've gotten in the recent ramp from the newer supply base. The other thing we've talked about to remind folks is with more and more our technical support and our application support is outside of California. It’s more and more right next to our customer, and all around the world, and that has is advantageous. That's where the acceleration -- when I say acceleration, that's what we're focused on now and we're doing a lot more, and you will hear more about it over the coming years. I would say that it’s not a big bang. We're not sprinting to this. It is more like a marathon. We are accelerating it, but I don't expect a big dramatic change the next quarter or two, but I think over the next two to three years we'll -- the customers will see benefits, our suppliers will see benefits, employees will certainly see benefits, and shareholders will see benefits. 
Raj Seth - Cowen & Co: John, you've put a model out there at 900 to a billion dollars which has pretty heady operating margins, et cetera. Is there a way just for comparison purposes and I understand it’s going to take awhile to execute on all these initiatives as say $600 million, something close to revenue levels that you're showing now, how much would you expect in terms of incremental margins operating in gross margin from these initiatives, let's say a year from now?
John H. Kispert: A year from now? Let me answer it this way, Raj.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Co: I guess I am trying to separate out the effect of higher volume from the restructuring activity which is hard if I look at a billion dollars number because we haven't soon that before.
John H. Kispert: Exactly right. Clearly folks listening to the call know the company well, know we have a financial model that leverages very well, and we're trying to continuously improve upon that. The way we originally put it together is these efforts that we're talking about half of -- when you looked at that model we talked about Semicon, about half of the benefit was going to come from volume, and the other half was going to come from these efforts. Your next question I think was how much is in gross margin. How much is in operating? That's tough for me, Raj.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Co: That's fine. I wasn't trying to split the two. That's fine. That's helpful.
John H. Kispert: Does that make sense.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Co: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Satya Kumar with Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thanks. Could you give us shipment guidance number for December -- and able to quantify what you thing bookings might look like by memory, foundry and logic in December?
Jeffrey Hall: Yeah Satya, it’s Jeff. Shipments we’re looking at between 675 and 700. What was the second half of the question?
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Bookings by memory, foundry logic in December.
Jeffrey Hall: For December we've got -- 
John H. Kispert: It’s about the same.
Jeffrey Hall: About the same, 45% memory. 
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. When I look at process control as a percent of equipment spending, it increased pretty dramatically back in ’01 and '02 but you can argue since then it sort of remained fairly constant as a percentage of total equipment spending. First of all, is that a fair assessment or not and if not, where do you see process control growing as a percent of equipment CapEx over the next several years do you still see that out growing CapEx?
Jeffrey Hall: Sure, Satya, good question. I think you're right. Have you to look further back and what you see is there are times when we see a significant increase in the overall percentage and that flattens for while, and then as customers find the new challenges in particularly it happens around no transitions, and I think that the upcoming no transition that we believe will drive acceleration again is around 45-nanometer. The reason we're seeing that is there are just additional challenges, more new materials coming on, the lithography problems are getting more challenging, and the focus on time to market for our customers means they're really going to work hard to bring up the new technologies quickly. So, from that standpoint, we think that we do see the ability to outgrow the overall CapEx over the longer period of time as a result of those technological changes that our customers are going to be dealing with.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Okay. That's helpful. If I can squeeze in one last thing, what kind of tax rates do you think we should be using for modeling purposes and how much can you talk about it and does it have any relationship with the option expense that you will start reporting once you start filing your reports?
Jeffrey Hall: Satya, tax rate forecasting is always a difficult thing because the governments are involved and rules and changes. The obvious thing at the moment is the R&D tax credit hasn't been renewed. Just ignoring that for a second, if you look back over the past several years what we call our natural tax rate that we talk about in our K's and Q's when we publish those has been in the high 20's to about 28% here recently, and I would say going forward that's about the best estimate based on what we know. Obviously there are a lot of things up in the air with the stock options, so I don't think stock options would have a big impact on that tax rate in the future years.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stuart Muter with RBC capital Markets.
Stuart Muter - RBC capital markets: Thanks. Good afternoon. A quick question, what were your shipments in the September quarter and how is the management of your lead time considering the fairly high level of shipments that are occurring right now?
Jeffrey Hall: Stuart, shipments were 652 in September, and I am going to let John take the second half here.
John H. Kispert: Stuart, I think your second question is right on it, its is probably the biggest challenge we've had the last three months is with the ramping of the newer products is how to keep cutting the lead times down and taking care of the needs of our customers. They've come down nicely. We've seen cycle times reduce as much as 50% on some products. As depending on what the delivery dates are, that's the name of the game right now on delivering for these ramps, getting it there when they want it, I am happy with where we're at. We're exactly where we plan, but wasn't for lack of effort over the last 90 days by the team.
Stuart Muter - RBC capital markets: Okay. And did you think you've lost any business because of the lead times?
John H. Kispert: That's kind of a golden rule at KLA-Tencor, don't lose business because of lead times. I know of no instances where that's happened. We will figure it out. I don't foresee that happening, Stuart.
Stuart Muter - RBC capital markets: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dave Duley with Merriman.
Dave Duley – Merriman: Good afternoon. I was wondering you talked about your orders in the December quarter on a product line basis. Can you talk about them on a geographic basis, which geographic regions in the September quarter will be up or down and a quick follow-on, someone asked the question about capital intensity at 45-nanometers. Maybe you can compare that to 65-nanometers, and will we see an increase in the number of tools between those technology nodes or an increase in opportunity from you and what are some of the apps we might be added at 45 that weren't at 65?
Jeffrey Hall: Dave, I’ll take the more quantitative one, first question. I think U.S. will probably be a little bit higher where we're targeting right now be about 25% of the total. Medical business in particular look strong this quarter there, and I think the logic business for KLA-Tencor will be stronger. I think the big change for us quarter on quarter September or December quarter will be in Japan where you will have a digestion period as you can imagine after a nice run of two or three very strong quarters, it will certainly slow down a little bit, and it is brought based. It isn't one piece there. It is just that business has been so good for a period of time. I think Taiwan will see a nice pop back up, and it’s primarily memory, and there is certainly some foundry business as we talked at the beginning of the call that is already slipped into the quarter. I think Korea there is probably be up quarter on quarter. As I off the top of my head as I look down the list here, the other pieces are relatively flat, that’s Singapore, China, Malaysia and Europe, relatively the same sized businesses.
Dave Duley – Merriman: Okay.
Jeffrey Hall: Same kind of mix.
John H. Kispert: Dave, your second part of the question which was the capital intensity as it relates to process control, at 45-nanometer what we're seeing are more and more technical challenges for our customers, whether it is measuring higher precision, better overlay, or defectivity, and the results is we're seeing customers want our latest technology. In fact, some technology we're just now bring to go market which have more capability and more features, as a result we get not only more option which drives unit growth, but also pricing growth. We see leverage both in the ASP and also in the growth of units.
Dave Duley – Merriman: Okay.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Friedman Billings Ramsey. 
Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: If I were to take mid-point of your guidance range and strip the ADE, seems like bookings for the December quarter are down by about 15% since the peak of June. Is that the kind of correction we're seeing in this new environment and going forward you may not see the 30, 40, 50% correction from the peak to the trough, and then as follow-up question, Taiwan in the Q1 was 65 million in bookings. Is the lowest over the past four or five quarters, and you said you're going to see a pop in the December quarter, but would it be realistic to expect Taiwan in terms of dollars of bookings to go up towards 200 million given what you see out there?
Richard P. Wallace: Yeah, Mehdi, this is Rick. I will take part one and John will take the second part of your question. In terms of peak to trough, you know, it’s really hard for us as you know to forecast. They're generally a lot of theories out there that say that we'll see more muted overall ranges in the cycles. The other factor that you have to remember is KLA-Tencor even when things soften, people continue to invest for two things, one is just technology and the capability to support the new technologies that are coming online which means we continue to see investment in R&D. We also see that the 45-nanometer challenges that the people are facing are going to drive them to invest as well, so what might be typical of the broader industry we think will probably do better in terms of this particular upcoming cycle as a result of the product positions that we have in the segment that we play in.
Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: But your customers have historically invested for the future generation. I am just trying to figure out the capacity part of the cycle. Are the cycles more muted? Should we expect kind of a 10 to 20% correction from the peak to the trough? Is that the new reality?
Richard P. Wallace: You know, I think it is real hard for us to predict that. Right now that seems to be the case, but I think that you have to really go through these, and every cycle tends to be a little bit different. Certainly what we're seeing in terms of our customers, what they're telling us is they want to make sure they have the capability to continue their yield work, and that's why we're seeing continued demand, but I would hesitate to try to predict overall cycle behavior being different.
Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: Got it.
Richard P. Wallace: John, do you want to take the other part, Taiwan. 
John H. Kispert: Mehdi, the question on Taiwan was fundamentally whether what the next two quarters sizing up to look like?
Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: And also extending that, with $65 million in bookings the lowest over the past five quarters, and given what you see in terms of opportunity in Taiwan, memory and foundry, would that be realistic to expect Taiwan bookings to get close to 200 million over the next several quarters?
John H. Kispert: I don't think that's out of -- that's the high-end of the range. That's certainly a number that's durable either this quarter or the March quarter. The opportunities are clearly there. It gets down to the timing of the orders in which quarter, but I think you're in the right realm of the opportunities that are there.
Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: Okay.
John H. Kispert: I think the big question for what it's worth and for us is more difficult for us to predict over let's say the next three to six months is the foundry spending in Taiwan, and we're doing well there, particularly as Rick was pointing out in 45-nanometer kind of investments and still 65-nanometer, but the more capacity like buys are still very difficult to try to predict.
Mehdi Hosseini - Friedman Billings Ramsey: Gotcha. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Pelayo with HSBC.
Steven Pelayo – HSBC: It looks like shipments are higher than revenue and is bookings are higher than shipments. Are you guys going to build backlog and deferred revenues yet again and then you hinted that March shipments are up from here. I am trying to figure out where these revenues can go as you guys continue to actually build deferreds and backlogs as opposed to actually getting it through the top line.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Steve. You know, it is like we alluded to, you know our model pretty well. We try to keep our months of shipment backlog in the five to six months in revenue in three to four. It is going to play out based on where bookings go from here. We're not going to really move away from that model. That's the model that has over time allowed us to smooth execution out of our manufacturing base, smooth our supply chain, allows us to keep R&D flat through any cycle which allows us to keep and extend our leads. It’s business model that let's us get out there and incremental operating profit of 50% to 60%. It is really hard to name a number without knowing all the orders are going quarter by quarter, but if you keep modeling us as 5 to 6 and 3 to 4, you will get pretty close because that's how we're running the business internally.
Steven Pelayo – HSBC: If you can clarify one thing for me, could you help us understand -- I understand you're going to give us more details in January and more optimal capital structure, but if we were just trying to think a little bit about it right now, you've got $12 a share in cash, generating, I don't know, a couple hundred million in operating cash flow at every quarter and – 200 million, (inaudible) per quarter, do you need half that amount if I was trying to put it over and under on it right now, is it pretty safe to say half that amount would be all KLA would need?
Richard P. Wallace: You know, Steve, it is like I said, we're not 100% finalized on the execution plan and really don't want to get out in front of it and preannounce it. When we're ready to make an announce, we'll come out and tell you exactly what we're going to do and how we're going to do and as usual be very upfront and transparent about what we're doing and why.
Steven Pelayo – HSBC: Can't blame a guy for asking.
Richard P. Wallace: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Great. Thank you. Rick, I want to come back to an earlier comment you made in your opening remarks about as NAND shifts over to DRAM, additional qualifications need to be done. Are you implying that there could still be a memory equipment order pause somewhere down the line?
Richard P. Wallace: What we're saying certainly that's part of what we're seeing is a shift to softening in NAND and the DRAM picking up the slack. That is what's in our forecast right now. That's what we're talking about for December, yes.
Stephen Chin - UBS: I guess you said that December memory orders be similar to the levels they were here in the September quarter, so doesn't seem like there is any material fall off.
Richard P. Wallace: Not from present level. I think it’s part of what we've seen and part of what we saw? September.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, can you share the estimated split between NAND and DRAM in the September quarter and what you foresee that to be in the December quarter?
Richard P. Wallace: Yeah. In -- we saw overall we had about 46% of our business in September was for memory and 33% of that was in NAND, so that was the trend that we saw that was down. My point was June was higher. We were at 62% for overall memory and 50% NAND, so that's really the softening we saw from DRAM moving from NAND to DRAM, and we don't see any reason that that's significantly going to be different in December. Remember there are a number of dual use fabs, so customers always have the option for redeploying based on the market condition that is they see between DRAM and NAND.
Stephen Chin - UBS: Okay. That was helpful. Thank you. 
Jeffrey Hall: Derrick, I think we have time for one more question here.
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up question from the line of Tim Arcuri with Citigroup.
Tim Arcuri – Citigroup: Hi, guys, when you look at foundries, and you look at how soft bookings have been, and I think a lot of bulls have argued that foundries never really spent much money, and the capital intensity there never really got high enough, yet they're not ordering any equipment, so what's changed there? It seems like something has changed in the foundry business such that the orders have in fact pulled back as much as they have in pretty much every other cycle yet they never got quote as overheated this cycle as they had in prior cycles. Thanks.
John H. Kispert: Tim, I am not going to be -- this is John Kispert. It’s difficult for me, God knows I talked to many of you about this over the last two years because we've all talked about this, I remind you in our case that at 20% of our orders, it’s still over 100 million out of the foundries, and it was a quarter for us this last quarter where we saw over 50 million of it kind of move out of the quarter and into the December quarter, so that it’s very sizable business for us still, but what we haven't seen are the larger capacity like ads that we've seen in the past accident back in '04 for instance, and the good news of course is that the feeling is eventually that will adjust and change, and we'll see that the pick up. We don't see that today, though. It seems pretty flat to us for the foreseeable future with great business for us, challenging issues, things that we're working on with all of the foundries, but not a big pick up.
Tim Arcuri – Citigroup: If I can just sneak in one last thing, there is a piece of your backlog sitting in inventory. Can you help us size what the dollar value of the backlog sitting in inventory is? Thanks.
John H. Kispert: Tim, it is for everybody else listening out there, there is part of our backlog that doesn't get counted, and that's shipments that have left the factory here, and it is next generation products. We're always focused a generation or two in front of what we already announced, and we call them alpha and beta products out there. Particularly as Rick was mentioning, when you start a transition towards in this case towards 45-nanometer, that inventory will grow for KLA-Tencor because the next generation products are leaving the factory. They're not in backlog. We haven't counted them as orders. They're sitting in inventory and we're working with our customers. The level right now Tim, is about average for the backlog that we have today. Earlier last year it was higher. It has come down kind of quarter on quarter just a little bit as we started to ramp into 65-nanometer. I wouldn't expect to see a big pop in that to the extent it comes down. We're always adding also every quarter, but it is not a large number. It is kind of a run rate number for KLA-Tencor, and it is not a number we've ever given out nor do we plan to keep giving out because it is really competitive for us. 
Tim Arcuri – Citigroup: Thanks, John. 
Richard P. Wallace - Chief Executive Officer, Director: I would like to thank you all for participating on our conference call today. The next earnings call is currently scheduled for January 25th at 2:00 Pacific standard time, and we look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the KLA-Tencor first quarter fiscal 2007 conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Derek and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor Q4 2006 conference call. Operator instructions I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead sir.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Derek. Good afternoon and welcome to the KLA-Tencor's fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Conference Call. I'm Jeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer. Joining me today on our call is Rick Wallace, our CEO, and John Kispert, our President and COO. We're here today to discuss our results for the periods that ended June 30th 2006. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find the copy on our Website, http://www.kla-tencor.com/ or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today's call with a discussion of industry development and KLA-Tencor's progress and strategy. Afterwards, I'll review selected financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. And then we will open the call for questions until approximately 3 o’clock Pacific Time. On the investor section of our Website, you'll find a simulcast of this call, which will be accessible on demand on the website, you will also find a calendar for investor events and presentations at investor conferences. You will also find links to KLA-Tencor's security filings. In those filings, you will find the description of risk factors that can impact our future results. And as you know, our future results are subject to risks and any forward-looking statements we make are subject to those risks. KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee that those forward-looking statements will come true. And although we take no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you can be assured that any update we do make will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. Before I turn it over to Rick, let me give you a brief update on the status of the options investigations. As we have previously announced the Company’s Board of Directors has appointed a special committees of independent Directors to conduct an internal investigation relating to the stock options granted to employees. On June 30th we announced that the special committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement date for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in prior years likely differed from recorded grant dates with such awards. The special committee has not yet determined whether any resulting compensation charges or tax implications are material or whether the company will ultimately have to restate previously issued financial statements. On July 24th we announced that as a result of the ongoing investigation and potential forward statement that at this time the company is unable to provide detailed GAAP or non- GAAP financial by quarter or for the year end it’s June 30th 2006.As a result on this call we will not be able to provide any specifics about growth margins, operating expenses inventory, taxes or other item that might be affected by share based compensations, because we cannot determine those amounts in accordance with GAAP until the special committee complete this review. As a result all financial numbers for the Q4 discussed on this call are not final and should be considered estimates. On July 24th we also announced that the company will not be in a position to file it’s annual report on form 10-K until after the special committee completes this review and that we do not currently inspect the investigation to be completed until after the form 10-K is required to be filed. In the meantime we are working diligently to make sure that we file our form 10-K as quickly as possible after the investigation is concluded. We have also consulted with the NASDAQ staff and while there is still a lot of work to be done, we are optimistic that we can avoid a situation where the delay in filing our forum 10-K affects our standing with the NASDAQ stock market, and with that I will turn it over to Rick.
Richard Wallace - Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Jeff, and thank you for joining our Q4 FYO6 quarterly call. Today I would like to provide you an update on our performance in the June quarter and our outlook on the rest of the year. I will also review highlights of our business strategy and several of our latest products that we are very enthusiastic about. Lastly I will close with guidance for September. As Jeff mentioned there are limits to the financial information that we are able to provide during the ongoing internal investigation, and the possibility that may be necessary to restate our historical financial results. The company continues to perform well both from a strategic and financial prospective. The nature of the investigation precludes us from providing financial results until we have determined whether or not we will need to restate. When that happens we will be in a position to provide complete financials. The management team continues to be focused primarily on executing on our strategy. Now we will share bookings revenue and shipments today. KLA-Tencor had 3rd consecutive quarter of accelerated bookings growth; orders for the June quarter came in at $814 million. Revenue for June was $579 million and shipments would ere support $624 million. These numbers are indicative of the strong demand we are seeing as our customers continued to invest in process control required for 90 nanometer capacity additions and for the yield ramp requirements of next generation 65 nanometer fabs. As new technologies become more difficult and challenging. The need for measurement and inspection increases in process control and gain share. Our outlooks for the orders in the second half of 2006, is for some increase from first half levels but at a slower rate that we saw in the first half. We continue to run our business with five to six months of unshipped backlog and three to four months of deferred revenue. In general our customer’s businesses are improving at a steady pace, roughly two to three time GDP semi revenues increase 7% in 2005 and our forecast to be up a 11 % in 2006 and to increase another 10% in 2007. Fabs are running at high utilization levels migrating rapidly to new more difficult technologies and a growing number of chipmakers are building few fabs. We are now tracking 17 new 300mm fabs scheduled to qualify by the end of 2007 which is up from the 15 that we have been tracking NAND flash is the major new product category which continues to have annual bit rate growth on the order of 200%. In this environment the outlook for investment and process controller is excellent. Now we are going to talk a little bit about the business strategy and the target business model that we discussed Semicon, Semicon West a couple of weeks ago. There we explained that our strategic focus is to extend our global leadership in metrology and inspection with differentiated technology and customer solutions in the semi and adjacent markets. We believe that strategy will enable us to get stronger, more profitable and even more effective in helping our customers keep pace with the technical demands of advancing technology nods, accelerating yields and faster time to markets. We are well positioned to execute on the strategy as we are building on very strong positions in our core market. At SemiCon we showed data and quarterly market positions in our core markets over the last eight quarters. I stated at that time that in 16 of the 17 markets that we compete in and we hold market leadership positions and in most of these, over the past eight quarters we have gained share. Our strong market share enables us to continue to invest the research funds necessary to meet our customers’ ongoing challenges. Our booking strength in the June quarter illustrates the market demand for inspection and metrology products as well as our leadership position in this critical market segment. In June we saw continued strength and bright field pattern way for inspection as well as gains in our core metrology and radical businesses. Market leadership is critical to our strategy. Our goal is to be market leaders in each segment in which we compete. While we are willing to be patient in cases where we don’t have a leading position we will only do so if we see a third path to market leadership through differentiated solutions. In the case of CD-SEM we determine that while we had a good product and it once of key accounts, we do not see a path to market leadership. Jeff Hall will provide the details around the one time cost associated with exiting the segments. Another reason that we determined we should exit CD-SEM is that this decision will make it easier to focus our efforts in this market segment with our optical CD tool where we are experiencing high market growth and enjoy a very strong market position. My expectation is that there are very few market segments that we will be unable to drive to leading positions and therefore the type of costs associated with the exit of the CD-SEM business should be rare. The core of our business model and what we will drive at success is great products and high gross segments. Let me talk for a minute about a few of the current products that we are particularly enthusiastic about. As I mentioned our optical CD tool has leading and growing market share as it provides our customer better precision in measurements at higher throughput. Our combined hardware and software solution and our experienced worldwide support team deliver a better CD and profile control at lower cost. Optical CD has become standard practice for FCI an gate control at 90 nanometers and we allowed even more levels at 65 and 45 nanometers. Bright field inspection is a market that we pioneered and we have left for over 20 years. The market continues to grow in size and it’s critical to our customers. We work very hard to maintain our market leadership over various products and technology transition. Our most recent major technology transition was our introduction of the 2800 broadband DUV/UV tool, approximately one year ago. When we developed the tool we decided to go with the unique architecture utilizing a broadband life spectrum. Our technology that has paid off over the last year as the 2800 has been widely accepted by our customers. Our product differentiation has enabled us to maintain our strong market position. When customers tell us whey they picked our tool, they say it out performs the alternatives in terms of sensitivity, data capture and speed. Gaining strong acceptance with our DUV/UV tools was critical over the last year and goes well for our market position and Brightfield going forward. Dark-field Brightfield pattern inspection is another market that we pioneered and have lead for over 10 years. As with Brightfield we recently introduced our latest technology, this one called puma, which utilizes our new streek architecture. The customer reaction has been positive and we have been able to actually build our market share in Dark-field particularly in memory fabs, we have displaced competitive tools and leading edge memory fabs. Customers report that the streek architecture allows significant improvement in speed and cost of ownership while extending our leading capability and sensitivity and defect capture. Puma is also used extensively in logic and foundry fabs as its ease of use, and short set up time greatly exceed competitor capabilities. All of these tools have been key contributors to the 65-nanometer yield ramps now in progress and they would be essential with the 65-nanometer volume ramps in 2007. As expected our customers continue to rely on us. Our ongoing market strength in terms of our ability to provide our customers with the solutions they need to deal with the ongoing challenges of metrology and inspection. These challenges continue to grow at each technology node. The industry is now starting to focus on 45-nanometer technology and 10% of our bookings last quarter were for 45 nanometer fabs and lines. The problems and challenges in 45 nanometers will be significant. Ongoing introduction of new materials for High-K gate oxides and Low-K insulators merging lithography and 3D transistors will all present yield management challenges to our customer base. We have been working for several years on the solutions for the measurement inspection problems at 45 nanometers and we are ready for the challenge. Now let me turn over our guidance for the September quarter. Remember the September is a seasonally down quarter for KLA-Tencor with bookings generally down 10%. September appears to have that seasonality this year and our booking projections are to be in the range of down 10% with a range of plus or minus 10%. Our revenue is expected to be between $610 million and $630 million. Now to give you the details, let me turn it back over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Hall - Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Rick, as Rick mentioned for the June ending quarter, net bookings raised $814 million. This number includes $12 million of orders de-booked in the quarter in accordance with our booking policy, which restricts actual bookings to a said criteria. In addition as a result of our CD-SEM decision we reduced our shipment backlog by an additional $21 million for tools that we have booked in previous quarters. After this adjustment we ended the quarter with $1 billion, $1.003 billions to be precise, a backlog for unshipped orders. Remember we do not include any service contract consignment or unreleased systems in this backlog number. We also have $475 million of revenue backlog related to products that have been shipped but not yet signed off by customers. It does not include any service revenue and is made up of tools delivered but are awaiting a written acceptance from the customer. Our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain high profitability throughout any business cycle. The regional distribution of orders for the June quarters was as follows. The US was 25% in line with its historical average of 25%; Taiwan was 24% higher than its historical average of 20%, Korea, China and Singapore combined to put 22% higher than their historical average of 20%. Europe was 9% lower than its historical average of 15% and Japan was 20% inline with this historical average of 20%. The product distribution of ordered was Wafer inspection was 54%. Radical inspection was 16%. Metrology was 15%, data storage was 2% and service was 14%. Before I turn to the income statement details, let me remind you that as a result of the ongoing investigations, we are only able to provide details on items that aren’t affected by its share base compensations. Revenues for the quarter that with 579 million, which is up 12% quarter over quarter and 18% from the same quarter last year. Revenue for the year was 2.069 billion versus 2.085 billion for the prior year and we added 300 million of total backlog over the course of the year. In the fourth quarter we incurred them one-time charges mostly inventory related as a result of our CD-SEM division. In addition, our fourth quarter GAAP results when finalized will include a one-time charge for our best estimate of the cost in effect to incur related to the ongoing investigations. Operating margins for the quarter excluding share-based compensations met our expectations as our team continued to execute well driving continuous cycle time and cost improvement in most areas. Other income for the quarter was 18.7 million. In the June quarter we again closed a substantial number of tax audit and statute and as a result we recognize the significant onetime benefit to our tax rate. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments end of the quarter at 2.3 billion an increase of $40 million quarter to quarter. And during the quarter we repurchase stock valued at approximately 78 million up 33% from the March quarter and we paid a dividend of 24 million. As a reminder our systematic Buy Back program is currently halted as a result of the absent investigations and while we are not certain when we will be able to restart to Buy Back. It is our intention to restart our systematic Buy Back plan as soon as possible. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at 440 down 16 million from march as a result of strong collections in the quarter. Capital additions related to fixed assets were approximately 15 million for the quarter and depreciation was 14 million. On a net basis, including retirements fixed assets increased by one million over the quarter. Head count end of the December quarter at 5900 up 130 from March. Primarily to support our production increases Field support and new product introduction. The majority of this increase was for people at customer site and at our new low cost manufacturing facility in Asia. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call over to Derick to give the instructions, let me request that you refrain from asking multi purpose question to give others some time and as all ways rather on a tight place schedule. So Derick can you pull-in please?
Operator: Yes sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jay Deahna with the J.P. Morgan.
Jay Deahna - J.P. Morgan: Thank you, Good after noon. Yeah, I think two questions. one on the options one on the options and one on fundamentals. First of all on the options, what exactly is the actual ramifications of not filing your 10-K on time. Give us a little more detail if you could on the potential for doing this thing or not. And then the second question on fundamental is for Rick. Rick, would you say that the 90 nanometer built out is largely completed and when do you see inserted transition to other 65-nanometer for foundries or smaller for processors and memory, what are the implications for process control, thank you.
Jeffrey Hall: Thanks Jay, this is Jeffrey, I’ll answer the first question about NASDAQ then I’ll turn it over to Rick. You know, so our 10-K is due to be filed on September 15th as we said we don’t expect the investigation to be complete by that time. However we are optimistic that it will be complete fairly shortly after that time. What will happen on September 15th is the NASDAQ will basically send us a notice that we didn’t file on time at which point we will start the Appeals process in going through it. And like I said, we have been talking -- we have been in discussions with NASDAQ and although it’s possible, the investigations will go on a little bit longer than we anticipate. We are certainly doing everything we can to get set up for it and to complete the -- the audited financial statement as quickly as possible after that. So we remain optimistic that we are not going to have any ramifications of this issue at the moment. Rick, you want to take the second question?
Richard Wallace: Sure. I think I have mentioned in my prepared remarks Jay that we are, okay about 30% of our bookings was 65 nanometer and below and we had about 10% employee -- 90 is running pretty well in most fabs. As you know there is a tale for that, some people are ahead of others but by and large we basically anticipate the percent of business that’s going to be towards 65 and below it’s increased to all over half of our business by the end of the calendar year, so we are certainly in that transition where more and more of our business is coming from 65 and beyond and below I suppose.
Richard Wallace: Just a quick follow up to Jeff’s response on the option issue, two parts. Number one, why it’s taking so long t do the investigation I don’t know that it seems that complicated, and the second issue is that what gives you the confidence that if it does track out and talk a little bit you are not going to have issues with NASDAQ.
Jeffrey Hall: Well, first of all on why it’s taking so long. The special committee obviously is doing a very thorough and detailed investigations and it is completely independent of management. They have got a lot of data reviewed here right we’re talking about you know, stock options from 5 to 10 and more years ago and you know, literally terabytes of data that they are having to go through. So well as we think it won’t be completed by September 15th but we have every reason to believe it’s going to be completed shortly thereafter. And then we are you know, teed up and ready to go on -- on any of the statement or anything else just going to have to change if they find something and you know, like I said we are not even sure who they are yet, so that’s why remain optimistic at the moment.
Richard Wallace: And are they telling you that if it’s a short delay, it’s okay, you’re sort of indicating that to them or for what?
Jeffrey Hall: No, the – I’m sorry I guess I don’t understand the question.
Richard Wallace: Jay let me maybe help you out. By September 15th there is appeals process. When you are calculate the amount of time that you have to respond to NASDAQ relative to, how long will we go through our analysis of what it would take to go through the financials and process them. We think we are still within the window of meeting our obligations for NASDAQ based on our discussions that we had with them. We have had those, they do have a timetable, the outlines, it’s part of their governance, and our analysis right now says that given our schedule and what we believe to be true even in the case where we have to go do, back through and work through those financials. It will still be -– although will be tied, we are still within their timetable.
Jeffrey Hall: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joyce Peterson with Goldman Sachs.
Jim Covello: Actually here is Jim Covello, how are you doing? Quick question on a scenario analysis kind of for the cycles we head down here in orders at least for this quarter. Not necessarily that you guys would agree with the scenario, but just to help us with modeling purposes. If orders were to go down 35% from last quarter’s 814 peak to the trough, what do you think revenues would that amount at? You know, in other words given all the deferred revenue you have on the balance sheet, how much -- how much do you think revenues would go down and orders will go down 35% from the peak to the trough, thanks.
John Kispert: Hey Jim, John Kispert. Unfortunately we haven’t modeled that for you. I can –- I will pull back on our golden rule here as far as modeling is concerned you know we’ll run with five or six months of unshipped backlog and three to four months of deferred revenue and I don’t see any reason that will ever change from that, you know, if they were to pull off 35% as you know we have enough backlog well that’s not going to be a you know, significant issue for us. I think the bigger question if they were to come down 35% for us would be -– what does it look like for the next two quarters out and we would size our business again to five or six months of unshipped backlog and three to four months of deferred revenue. Right now what I see is lot of customers want their shipments in their September, October, November timeframe and so we would have to work you know work through that but that would be the only issue as far as quickly sizing the business you know that kind of run rate.
Jim Kispert: Great, appreciate it.
John Kispert: Thanks Jim.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. I’m wondering when you shut down something like the CD-SEM business you know since that was a business where you didn’t get your normal share, will that have a positive immediate impact on the margins? In other words is that a lower margin business when you shut it down in your mid size, Richard?
John Kispert: Hi Brett, I guess but yeah, that was the idea. Yes, you are on the right page.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Okay and then second, just a quick follow on to that. You know when you when presented your new quarterly model and then your ability to get to the 60% type of gross margin and above at the Semicon last. One of the things you talked about there was, you know, shipping some of the production and cost phase out of the US into lower cost regions and what not. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, if you did get a slower period would that accelerate your ability to make some of those moves, could you talk a little bit about that?
John Kispert: That’s a great question Brett. If -- if I am not forecasting a slower period it certainly doesn’t feel slower right now but that would be certainly easier to move things quicker having said that we have a very aggressive plan in place in the next year or so as we talked about SemiCon. For instance we’ve -- we’ve gone in our South East Asia plant over the last two quarters, we’ve gone from shipping zero basically front-end automation for most of our products in the company and shipping zero about a 100 days ago to up now, so this quarter we will probably ship out a 100 up. So we are being pretty aggressive with the move that is some transition cost particularly in kind of, ramp where that we are in right now, but now if we put the resources and search capacity in place to be able to handle it.
Brett Hodess - Merrill Lynch: Great.
John Kispert: Thank you.
Operator: Thanks Brett. Your next question comes from Satya Kumar w the Credit Suisse.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse First Boston: Yeah, hi thanks. If I think your mid point of your guidance was September and extrapolate your comment that second half orders will be up, if you are looking at December bookings down about 5% also, is that sort of the right map?
 John Kispert: I guess it’s not the map I am looking at Satya. I would think that, let me say it in two ways. Right now the -- the sales funnel would suggest that December is up from the average of the guidance that Jeff and Rick gave you. Now the drivers that really are this -- this orders are relatively large from the period we are right now, because people are filling out 300mm capacity. The other big driver that we were looking at in the second half of the year for our business is the transition of 65 nanometer for particularly around the foundry and particularly around logic and I think one of the keys for us as we look in the second half of the year is that, is for our customers more and more to commit to -- to that but right now, it looks pretty solid for us, for December to be up. From the mid point of that September quarter and that -- and we are looking out at case to be flat the third driver as Rick mentioned early will certainly receive 45 nanometer pilot stuff picking up and that’s usually a pretty good business for us.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse First Boston: Okay, another quick follow-up. Did you guys give which your orders by device segment for June and if you can give a quick update on how it looks for September?
John Kispert: No. By -- by device.
 Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse First Boston: Memory foundry and all that?
John Kispert: No. Logic for June was about 20%, foundry was about 20% and memory as we said semi kind of was 60%. Going forward into the September quarter memory is still going to be strong but I think its probably more in the 40% to 45% range particularly in Japan, that I think memory will be fine. Logic we think it’s going to pick up at 35% and again that’s Japan look stronger towards in the September quarter and I think the US will be little be stronger for us you know, through the summer in logic and that’s uncommon, usually it’s a little bit slower. And foundry about 25%, I think the question there is the transition to 65 nanometer and the timing of that is in the December quarter or the September quarter and I guess it’s something we will watch closely as a quarter goes on as far as the quarter on quarter order growth rate.
Satya Kumar - Credit Suisse First Boston: Great, thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Timothy Arcuri - Citigroup: Hi guys couple of things number one, John or Jeff could you guide shipments for September?
 John Kispert: About 650, Tim.
Timothy Arcuri - Citiproup: 650 okay, and then you know, one of the big test vendors come in to the Japan the night before last that there has been a slowdown in the last couple of weeks in ROQ activities for some testers. Has there been any change in tone from your customers in terms of their orders during the you know, back half of the year?
 John Kispert: In the last 24 hours or?
Timothy Arcuri - Citiproup: No just in the last say, you know month or so relative to what it was before?
John Kispert: No I don’t think so. I don’t, certainly in memory all you focus no but there is forever chatter both up and down, but I’d say in the last couple of days if anything has gotten more positive is now, does that mean that the rest of the week goes that way, I don’t know. But we haven’t seen any change. The timing of the orders is always in question you know, is it this week or next week but the total sales funnel hasn’t changed much.
Timothy Arcuri - Citiproup: Thanks John.
John Kispert: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes form Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: You mentioned that the Reticle area was strong. Can you go into more detail about what’s going on there and how you see that progressing going forward?
Richard Wallace: Ed, hi it’s Ric, yeah absolutely. Reticle continues to be strong for a couple of reasons. One, as you know the challenges of advanced lithography continued to push our customers and so we provide there. The other thing is we’ve had some good success with Reticle and wafer fab and what we are seeing that that’s really helped us grow that business. So really both of those impacts, and all coming from the increased challenges with the advanced lithography notes and the associated Reticle to support that, so that’s been a very solid business for us.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Great thanks.
Jeffrey Hall: Before we take the next question, this is Jeff, you picked up the wrong number Tim, shipments you know, higher than 650, probably in the 650 to 675 range.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael O’Brien with Bear Stearns
Michael O’Brien - Bear Stearns: Just real quick -- the 17 fabs, I think 17 for 2007, could you give me an idea of how you are tracking them from you know, which ones will be at some level of production volume as you exit through 2007 and which ones will you know, have the shell up and maybe only some R&D tools or some pilot line type tools. If you could give us an idea of how that’s going to impact wafer --?
John Kispert: Sure Mike, what we look out there is who is really ready to qualify which means they’ve got to have the shell up and they’ve got to have equipment, they got to be doing for Silicon. You know, we discovered when we talking to some customers at SemiCon West, and they’ve really gotten efficient at building these fabs fast and getting them up and going. You know the fab faster and then you go to house to California, and so we are really -- we talked closely with them as you might imagine and work on those schedules, so it really is about who is ready to call upon.
Jeffrey Hall: When you look at right now Michael it looks as though it’s more front half of the year of loaded that second half, but as far as order dates and when we would expect something, but that will jack you around you know, business moves in 2006.
Richard Wallace: Now so first to have orders sound EOP getting the bulk of the orders for the 17, the way it looks like right now.
Jeffrey Hall: And that’s where the visibility is today, that’s right.
Edward White - Lehman Brothers: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stuart Muter with RBC Capital Markets.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah, thanks good afternoon. You provided some regional commentary in terms of September booking. Could you just finish the piece of the puzzle how does Taiwan look in China, Korea and Singapore?
Richard Wallace: Stuart, I’m sorry. For the September quarter for Asia.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, thank you.
Richard Wallace: You know I think Taiwan will -- I think the foundries will probably be spending in generally the same rate, I think if anything that’s probably sum upside, and getting at the timing, so I'm looking for them in the September quarter. The little bit less than 20%, 15% to 20% of the order book. Korea what we’ve learned though the years and then I said this many times is you know, there is -- a strong quarter usually followed by a weaker quarter and then followed by a stronger quarter. Right now it looks a lot of activities there, I would say it’s probably slightly down stay tuned. China is definitely a stronger region for us in the second half of the year. I mean, there’s lot of focus on that and if we look at Singapore, I think September probably a slower quarter there followed by a stronger quarter in the December quarter based on what we are seeing today.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Great, that’s helpful. And then a quick question in terms of you know, meeting the operational goals that were laid out at SemiCon West you know, it seems that a good amount of work required to achieve that is cost reduction. Will you need to strategically add new leadership in some of the division to achieve those cost cutting goals?
Jeffrey Hall: Stewart, I think crosscutting has been a part of Kelly for about 25 years. It does not serve as a new focus for us, it’s just wondering we are probably talked about a little bit more at the SemiCon. So the short answer is no, I don’t see any changes, we are excited about the team we have and the teams certainly rallied around what we are going to get down over the next couple of years.
Stuart Muter - RBC Capital Markets: Great, thank you.
operator: Here next question comes from Suresh Balaraman with Thinkequity.
Suresh Balaraman - Thinkequity Partners: Thanks. When bookings were at much lower level, I understand the last range in guidance something like a plus or minus 10% of a particular number, at 800 million plus on bookings it seems like a pretty huge variation from the lower end of your guidance to the top end of your guidance. Is it that much uncertainty related to when the bookings would fall?
Jeffrey Hall: Suresh, the way to think about it is when the -- it is that much larger right now. When you look at trying to millimeter phase buys right now, there is certainly north of $450 million for (inaudible) that would minimum, and some of them can be close to $100 million. So yeah, the Math still works, the 10% range is about right for us, for a deal and deal and a half, it could actually be negotiated out of quarter of fourth into a quarter.
Suresh Balaraman - Thinkequity Partners: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh with CIBC World Markets.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Hi guys, how are you. I am looking at your wafer inspection product revenue and the number I get is the mid $400 million range and that’s the biggest number that I have in my model going back to 2000. Can you kind of run us through what sort of sustaining or driving that kind of record number for booking for wafer inspection? And you know, if you could also talk whether or not wafer inspection on bare silicon wafers has any kind of impact on that number or has driven that number?
John Kispert: Hey Gary, let me say -- let me just correct one thing upfront, make sure we are all in the same page. What Jeff gives in this guidance is bookings, and so it’s orders. That wasn’t revenue, you said revenue, I just want to make sure everybody understand, so that mid 400 number is certainly on the order side. And yes, it was a nice quarter it’s all of our newer products and newer architectures, which as Rick said in the prepared remarks where specially gratifying for us because of this stuff we’ve working out for a while. Things like our (inaudible), our street technology in dark field, Rick mentioned our optical CD architecture. All of them are doing well. You just mentioned wafer inspection if you go through Reticle and metrology old more we are strong and up in the you know, 35% range or above. Rick will mention you the products.
Richard Wallace: Yeah sure, I think we talked about 2800, the market acceptance we have seen over the last year, what happens when the product transition like this is, you got to get established as a tool of record and then what we are starting to see now is, we won those tool of records and they start turning into multiple buys. You mentioned the wafer inspection net profits and very strong for us, I think the overall performance is just illustrative of the growing percent of capital the people are putting on process control in terms of inspection metrology so, that’s what we are really seeing and that’s why you are seeing it, exceeding the levels that we had 2000 because this is becoming a growing, again a growing segment, there is a percent of overall sales.
John Kispert: Okay, one last thing, it wasn’t one particular product or product segment, I don’t know that’s what you push and ____ and was but it was broad based across everyone of the product lines and wafer inspections.
Gary Hsueh - CIBC World Markets: Great, thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Stephen O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you good afternoon. Considering your strategy to either of the markets, can you give us some idea of how you are looking at metal film metrology and macro defect inspection?
John Kispert: Good question Steve, in terms of metal film metrology that is the market we have been in and we did at the same time with (inaudible) that’s the market we discontinued our investment in because that’s one, that is another example but that was pretty small force so its not notable in terms of the overall financials. In terms of macro there is a great example of the market where we have had some tractions and we believe there is upside in our strategy and we are pretty confident of our ability to expand on our position there and other gives room for growth that we are -- I think we are neck and neck with in terms of leadership but we typically find ourselves giving high market shares, so we think there is an opportunity for growth and share.
Stephen O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, and one another quick question can you give us a look up data on what your intentions are, with DNS, an electro-list deposition but that just starts to fall under these kinds of strategic decisions too?
Richard Wallace: Steve, you are right on. Yeah, absolutely that one is a example of we have a great product, the team has done a great job and we anticipate that will be an important technology probably 45 nanometer or 32 nanometer but Casey will lower our investment levels in that and get down below 20% so that we are not consolidating on that, on the book of that.
Stephen O'Rourke - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Marisa Hernandez with the UBS.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: Hello?
John Kispert: Hi Marisa, go ahead.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: I wanted to ask if you could give us the split between DRAM and Flash orders if you have it for June and what you think it is going to look like in September?
John Kispert: Yeah, the memory in June was about 60% of that. I’d say that Flash was probably about half of that total and of that half, half of the half, or the quarter was dedicated Flash and the other piece was obviously we would -- what we were going flexible kind of -- you can go memory, can go NAND and I think you know that the strategies some of our customers have certainly implemented with success.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: Okay, and do you think that’s going to climb up the same in the September quarter?
John Kispert: I think the right way to think about it is 25-20 -- or half and half as far as NAND is concerned, going forward, I don’t see that changing much. And as I said earlier, I think the September quarter for memory is down a little bit and NAND will probably be down a little bit also, so probably about 20% of our orders would be out on NANDS area if you will.
Marisa Hernandez -UBS Securities, LLC: Okay. And then how do you expect your trends to change in the September quarter, will it still be going up?
John Kispert: Yeah, it will continue up a little bit.
Jeffrey Hall: To one of the earlier questions, Marisa, one of the things we are dealing with here is the transition in operations to other parts in the world so headcount is you know increasing in Asia and we are not necessarily coming down another part in the world so there is a bunch of transitions going on as we move operations.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: Okay, and finally if you could clarify say something for me be causing the investigations and the options in fact you said that on September 15th you will get a notice from NASDAQ, and did you say from there an appeal process starts? Is that what you said and if so what does it really mean?
John Kispert: It means you have time to just find out that one to understand when you are going to be able to file and there is a certain amount of time in that process that you need to respond it will go, have it hearing in a way typically it goes and work through the details and what I said in response to the question from Jay was that we would be in the position to you know base on what we understand today in event we had restate that we would be working on that and be able to get through that within the timeline allow by NASDAQ to get through the process.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: Okay, and what is the timeline along those NASDAQ too?
John Kispert: Yeah it’s shorter of 180 days from the time you get those the notice and then there is another day, which is …
Richard Wallace: 90 days after the hearing.
John Kispert: 90 days after the hearing, so that’s why we are pretty confident because you could do that now on the timeline and then you can analyze what it takes if you had to go through restatement, and that’s why we think we would under that window.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: Okay, and that the hearing involve presenting works coming been done by the special committee?
John Kispert: No.
Marisa Hernandez - UBS Securities, LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Prudential.
Ben Pang - Prudential: Yeah just a follow up on an earlier question regarding the range of the other guidance I think earlier when you guys started giving this range you mention that part of the reason was –- so that’s your you know customers coming for some of these bargaining, in a big bargaining tight deal but you know that is mutual guiding. What’s the motivation for the large orders or your customers are now in their 80s you know like $50-$80 million range I don’t think it break those quarters up?
Jeffrey Hall: Sure, that can happen Ben it has happened yeah so I don’t have to answer to the question, what’s the motivation exactly? What your question assumes is that it’s more economically feasible for them I think the key for them and for us is the deliver dates and do we have the right technology and the right solutions to solve what they are looking for and then I think secondarily as we talked before is kind of a negotiations of this and that’s where we try to sale the other thing driver of course is particularly with these newer products the pricing has gone higher so the range can kind of get figure just because one or two of those units might move in and out of the quarter and we don’t want to be in the position with that you know takes everything.
Ben Pang - Prudential: Okay and a follow up for that when companies order in the calendar and your products, can they still get those in the calendar year?
Jeffrey Hall: Depends on the product, and we are certainly going to try. The question is just too high hypothetical but Rick and I have been around here for a long time, its kind of rule one, the customer wants it sooner. You know, we’re going to put the slack in place in manufacturing to make sure we can get it to them and so many cases even if we don’t have the order yet but you know, we don’t try to push you know, we try to meet the delivery dates our want and try not to push them out, that’s for sure.
Ben Pang - Prudential: What does it really mean when you say that you try to run your business at a certain backlog level, that’s what I’m trying to understand here, your backlog was very strong and you have great deferred revenue, but at what side will you actually start to differ some of the orders?
Jeffrey Hall: We are not there yet I think one of the big keys for the company right now and we did a real good job in June I think, we are up to good start here in September is cutting our cycle time on this newer products and they are down about anywhere from 25% to 40% over the last couple quarters. And I think just a very key quarter can do exactly you’re pointing out which is to be able to decrease the cycle timing if the shipment as Jeff said earlier around the 675 level and that will meet customers demand in the sites that they want.
Ben Pang - Prudential: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.
Raj Seth - Cowen & Company: Thank you, John, just a thought a little bit about his views that the optimal capital structure here and that structure, I’m curious what your view is on that topic that seems to be a big philosophical change and if this is something what you folks are trying to decide, how to do or if you should do and where the board is on that?
Jeffrey Hall: Hi Raj, this is Jeff let me take that. You know, we evaluate our capital structure you know, frequently. If you, four or five quarters ago, putting the first dividend in the industry you know, we are going to keep looking at our alternatives here you know, if we come to the conclusion adding debt is going to make sense for shareholders you know, we will do it but we certainly haven’t come to that conclusion today but we will keep reviewing and that position may change over time.
John Kispert: Hi Raj, I doubt there hasn’t been a sea change in our philosophy on capital structure in the company.
Raj Seth: And with regard to buybacks you are currently preclusive, I guess given investigation when does that open is that at the full conclusion of the investigation and whatever restatement et cetera, or is there something else that open the window for you?
Jeffrey Hall: No, we have to kind of review that as facts come out and we get through the investigation so you know, the hard to question to answer with a black line at the moment but we continue to review this and soon we can get back in the market we r all set and ready to go and to get back in the market keep going back.
Raj Seth: Okay thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Maire with Needham.
Robert Maire - Needham: Hi. Sorry to be the dead horse here but just to talk about the SEC timing and such, we’ve seen two other companies in the space Advance Energy and (inaudible) listed for missing the 180-day Q period after notice of deficiency and it would seem that you’re going to get that, I'm concerned that you’re going to be late on the K here. Given that it’s been sort of two months that the committee has been working on it, we don’t have an end and we’re talking about a lot more data you just said five to ten years in Gigabytes of data, or whatever, have you been working on perhaps the numbers or a hypothetical situation what if in parallel to this investigation or, is there something that could be confidence that you can get it cured within the 180-day window where others haven’t been able to?
Richard Wallace: Yeah I appreciate the question, this is Rick. We have looked at the timeline, we work specifically at the timing in terms of what it takes to get you know, through the next filing, and as you suggested we have looked at the process of what it would take to go through the accounting if in fact we needed to restate and that’s why we –- at this time believe that we can make the timing.
Robert Maire - Needham: Okay and is there sort of a date or callings from the committee to come up with a final you know sort of determination a month away, a week away, a couple of months away?
John Kispert: Yeah, what Richard said is that you know, we will miss the September 15th -day, but we expect committee report in and around that at the time and surely thereafter.
Robert Maire - Needham: Okay, so it sounds like a relatively safe or it seems fairly, likely that you wouldn’t be able to report September numbers either.
John Kispert: That’s correct.
Robert Maire - Needham: Okay thank you.
Richard Wallace: Do we have any -– we have time for one more question here.
Operator: Your final question comes from Gus Richard with First Albany Capital.
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital: Let’s take my question if looking at the BOM market some of the manufacturers has been having problems with very mixed variations, I’m wondering if you guys were doing anything along those lines to help us set out.
John Kispert: Gus, John Kispert, I'm fizzing through my mind all the -– many customers we have, SPR helping everywhere we can push the issues kind of range. I think one of the big help we’ve been able to bring given that particular over the last quarters has been the products that we announced number of years ago, has become a -- those issues in particular over the last quarters and you know and I know its solving problems in the memory space.
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital: Got it. And then just one quick comments Rick congratulations from what I hear you are doing a good job making all decisions and kind of cleaning up the operation and clearing the structure.
John Kispert: Thank you, I think it’s a team effort and we are all committed to expanding business model and very pleased to be in a good position in the market.
Gus Richard - First Albany Capital: Got it, thanks.
Jeffrey Hall: I would like to thank you all for participating in the conference call today. Our next conference call is currently scheduled for October 27th. We look forward speaking to you next quarter, thank you.

Operator Instructions:
Jeffrey Hall, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Derek. Good afternoon and welcome to the KLA-Tencor's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2006 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Jeff Hall, the Chief Financial Officer and I'm joined here by Rick Wallace, our CEO, and John Kispert, our President and COO. We're here today to discuss our third quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2006. We released these results this afternoon at approximately 1:15 p.m. Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find a copy at our Website, http://www.kla-tencor.com/ or call 408-875-3600 to request a copy. Rick will lead off today's call with a discussion of industry developments and KLA-Tencor's recent progress and strategy. Afterwards, I'll review the financial results for the third quarter and then we'll open up the call for questions until approximately 3 O’clock Pacific Time. On the investor section of our Website, you'll find a simulcast of this call, which will be accessible on demand for approximately two weeks. On the Website, you will also find a calendar for investor events and investor conferences. You will also find links to KLA-Tencor's security filings. In those filings, you will find descriptions of risk factors that can impact our future results. And as you know, our future results are subject to risks and any forward-looking statements we make are subject to those risks. KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee that those forward-looking statements will come true. And although we take no obligation to update those forward-looking statements, you can be assured that any update we do make will be broadly disseminated and available over the Web. In an effort to provide additional information to investors, our comments today may include certain non-GAAP financial measure and you can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our press release. Before we begin, let me remind you that we implemented FAS 123R in the September quarter, and therefore the results we announced earlier today reflect the expensing of share-based compensation. Consistent with the prior calls, we will focus our comments on the operating P&L, that is excluding share-based compensation. And I will discuss the impact of share-based compensation on those results. We believe this approach best needs the needs of investors and analysts for comprehensive, compliance and comparable data. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rick.
Richard Wallace, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Jeff. And thank you for joining our third quarter FY '06 earnings call. Today I will be talking to you about the following: First, the current environment and our outlook for the rest of 2006 an update on KLA-Tencor products, the financial highlights of the March quarter, and our guidance for the June quarter. Jeff will then take you through the details of our March quarter and then we'll take your questions. I'll start by saying, we had a strong second quarter of growth in our business, particularly in bookings. As in 2005, our customers continue to increase their investment in process control to ramp new fabs faster, to solve the difficult yield problems they face at 65 nanometers and to stay on Moore's Law. Today that investment in process control is focused on 90 nanometer capacity additions and the yield ramp requirements of next generation 65 nanometer fabs. Memory was 43% of orders and again, the strongest segment in the March quarter, with significant NAND flash spending. NAND fabs, both dedicated and mixed with DRAM, were half our memory bookings. Logic at 37% of orders was also strong in March, with the investment in 65 nanometer capacity in the U.S. the strongest region for logic. Foundry was the lowest segment, at 20% of booking. Foundries continue to spend under their historical rates as they cautiously add manufacturing capacity to existing fabs. Foundry fabs are at very high utilization rates and we would expect that an increase in foundry orders as we go through 2006. Although most of the increase in bookings comes from additions current manufacturing capacity at 90 nanometers, our new tools are having the greatest successes in 65 nanometer fabs, where the yield learning challenges are the greatest. As 65 nanometers, yields increase in 2006, our customers should gain confidence and start ordering for the 65 nanometer capacity ramp. So, the outlook for 2006 is bright and it continues to improve. Semiconductor revenues are expected to grow faster in 2006 than the 7% growth of 2005. Most forecasts are in the range of 10% growth. We expect capital investment to grow in the range of 10% to 15% in 2006. Several months ago, we were expecting CapEx growth in the 5% to 10% range, so our customers are gaining confidence in their immediate future and with very high levels of fab utilization, the revenue growth plans require investment in new fab capacity. The driver for growth continues to be the transition to new 300 millimeter fabs, the growth of consumer electronics, the 200% bit growth of NAND and the increased investment in process control. The March quarter was a very active period for new product introductions at KLA-Tencor. And I would like to take you through the highlights from what was a very productive quarter. We extended the speed and sensitivity of our broadband UV visible light bright field platform, with the introduction of the 2367. This tool compliments our previously introduced 2800 full specter Brightfield inspection tool and provides our customers with the capability to speed their yield learning at 65 nanometers, with increased sampling and sensitivity at the lowest cost of ownership. The initial tools have performed very well on fabs, finding a broader range of defects at faster speeds and competing systems. Leading logic and foundry fabs have already adopted the 2367 in their 65-nanometer yield ramps. The eS32, introduced in February, not only benefit 65 nanometer yield ramps, but also supports 45 nanometer development efforts. The eS32's ability to find a broad range of very small defects and subtle electrical problems on a fast and reliable platform clearly distinguishes it from competitive tools. Customers, particularly flash and DRAM manufacturers, cite the eS32's superior sensitivity, reliability, throughput, and flexibility when ordering. When combined with advanced software and the MicroLoop test structures, the eS32 provides fast yield learning and a 2 to 8x cost ownership advantage. Logic and memory customers are both using the eS32 to solve yield problems of 65 nanometer transistors such as the integration of nickel silicide and strained silicon to develop their next generation transistors. We also introduced the STARlight-2 reticle inspection system. STARlight, first introduced in 1993, is the industry standard for contamination inspection of reticles in both fabs and reticle manufacturing. The problem of surface contamination from growing crystals or haze is severe at 90 nanometers on 300 millimeter wafers. These problems are called progressive defects and are caused by a longer exposure of reticles to high intensity light in 193 nanometer steppers with 300 mm wafers. Fabs therefore, require periodic inspection of reticles to detect these progressive defects before they can cause yield or reliability problems. STARlight-2 extends the inspection capability to 65 nanometer reticles. And the new techniques of extreme resolution enhancement that 65 and 45 nanometer will require. Staying on Moore's Law presents many technical and financial challenges to our customers. And as 2006 proceeds, those challenges will start to come from 45 nanometer pilot line. We have been investing in the development of a complete suite of inspection and measurement products at 45 nanometers. I have just described some of them to you and we will continue to introduce more as we go through 2006. Now, turning to the financial highlights from our March quarter. Net orders were $614 million, up 20% from December. Revenue of $518 million was up 6% from last quarter. Net income was $129 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, excluding non-cash equity based compensation, which was up 26% from last quarter. Including equity compensation, net income was $98 million or $0.48 per diluted share, which is up 28% from December quarter. Orders grew in March, as customers continued to increase their investment in process control for leading edge capacity ramps, and for yield learning at 65 nanometers. We expect both investments by our customers to continue in the current quarter. So, our guidance for the June quarter is as follows: Bookings in the range up 10% plus or minus 10%, revenue to be between $560 million and $575 million and EPS in the range of $0.68 to $0.71 per share. Jeff will provide the details for bridging GAAP and operating EPS. We are looking forward to a third quarter of strong growth in our business. Our customers have invested prudently in capacity over the last year. Fab utilization is at very high levels and customers have both near-term and strategic needs for increased 300 millimeter manufacturing capacity. Process controls continues to be a growing part of their investment. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff Hall.
Jeffrey Hall, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Rick. Okay, let me start by going through the quarter in a little more detail. As Rick just said, net bookings for the March quarter were 614 million, which was up 20% from the December ending quarter, and 45% higher than our quarterly results from a year ago. This number excludes $2.1 million of orders that we have debooked in accordance with our booking policy, that restricts actual bookings to a set criteria. The set criteria mandate that technical specifications are signed off, valid terms and conditions are finalized, and delivery is scheduled within 12 months. We ended the quarter with approximately $836 million of backlog for unshipped orders. Remember, we do not include any service, contract, consignment, or unreleased systems in this backlog number. And as we told you last quarter, we have a historically high level of unreleased products in the field at this time. In addition, we have $430 million of deferred revenue related to products that have not been shipped -- that have been shipped but not yet signed off by customers. This invoice system revenue is deferred under SAB 104. And includes no service revenue and is made up of tools delivered, but awaiting written acceptance from the customer. Our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain high profitability throughout any business cycle. The regional distribution of orders for the quarter was as follows. The U.S. was 33%, higher than its historical average of 25%; Taiwan was 14%, lower than its historical average of 20% Korea was 7% and Korea, China, and Singapore combined were 16% lower than their historical average of 20%, Europe was 11%, lower than its historical average of 15% and Japan was 26%, higher than its historical average of 20%. The product distribution of orders was, wafer inspection was 52%, reticle inspection was 15%, metrology was 15%, data storage was 3%, and service was 15%. Turning to the income statement. Revenue for the quarter was 518 million, up about 6% quarter-to-quarter and down 4% from the same quarter last year. Gross margin was 57.5% for the quarter, compared to 56.9% in the prior quarter. Operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D, were 166 million. This expense level is up 1 million quarter-to-quarter, and below our forecast of up 2% to 3%. For the quarter, other income was 17 million, and the effective tax rate was 14%, slightly better than our guidance of 20%, plus or minus a few points. For fiscal year 2006, we continue to anticipate that our tax rate will be approximately 20% plus or minus a few points, depending on the renewal of the R&D tax credit and resolution of various tax audits currently underway in multiple jurisdictions. Net income for the March quarter was 129 million or $0.63 per diluted share. The impact of non-cash equity based compensation reduces this number by $0.15 per diluted share and the approximate breakout is as follows: Cost of goods sold, $0.03, R&D, $0.05, SG&A, $0.14 and a tax benefit of $0.07. This includes a one-time expense of approximately $0.04 related to the retirement of our prior CEO, that we told you about last quarter. In the June quarter, we expect expense from share-based compensation to be about $0.12. And going forward, we expect this expense to decline as fewer options are issued and older more expensive options are exercised. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.3 billion, an increase of 58 million quarter-to-quarter. Also during the quarter, we repurchased stock valued at approximately 59 million, up 20% from the December quarter, and paid a dividend of 24 million. Inventory increased by 27 million to 438 million, as we continued to significantly ramp our production facilities during the quarter, as a result of increased demand from our customers. Let me remind you that this inventory includes a historically high amount of new products in the field that haven't been counted as bookings or shipments and are not included in backlog. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at 456 million, up 84 million from December, as a result of the increase in shipment. Capital additions related to fixed assets were approximately 20 million for the quarter, and depreciation was 13 million. So, on a net basis, including retirements, fixed assets increased by 7 million over the quarter. Head count ended the December quarter at 5,770, up approximately 200 from December, mostly to support our production increases, field support, and new product introduction. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call over to Derek to give the polling instructions, let me request that you refrain from asking multi-part questions to give others some time. Derek can you begin the polling, please?
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Hi guys, couple of things, just the first thing, Jeff, can you tell us what the shipments were and what you would guide shipments to for the June quarter? Thanks.
A - Jeffrey Hall: Shipments were about 530. And looking forward, we think 620 or so.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, also, can you give us an idea of the -- if you look over the last couple of quarters, about nine months or so, from the baseline of kind of $350 million in inventories, how much of the $80 million worth of inventory build is related to new products that are in the field that are almost -- that are going to be valued at COGS? Is it the entire $80 million increment, or is it just part of that?
A - Jeffrey Hall: It is a good portion.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Satya Kumar.
Q - Satya Kumar: Yeah, thanks for taking my call. The $0.68 to $0.71 includes the option expense or excludes it?
A - Jeffrey Hall: Excludes.
Q - Satya Kumar: Excludes. Okay, thank you. If I look at your June bookings guidance up 10%, can you help us understand what are some of the moving parts in terms of orders by segment?
A- Richard Wallace: Sure. This is Rick. I think that as we always talk about, our orders tend to come in, in large pieces. So, when we look out, we do see activity in a number of regions and a lot of big products going on. But in general, what we look to from a regional perspective is we do see -- we talked about the ROI, the rest of Asia part going up. We see some increase from about 16% up to about 20%. We see Taiwan roughly flat at about 15%. And it looks to us like we'll see an increase in our business in the -- Japan looks pretty solid as well. And so U.S. it will be about similar, a little bit lower levels. All in all, I think, pretty strong. Memory continues to be strong for us. We're not counting on a lot in terms of the foundries for next quarter. But memory continues to look like it's going to be strong overall, with both NAND and DRAM capacity increases.
Q - Satya Kumar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs.
Q - James Covello: Good afternoon guys, thanks so much. Quick question. On the -- understanding that the foundries are going to book more as we go throughout the year little bit. At what point do we have to think about their kind of historical levels changing a little bit because they may be thinking about investing differently and NAND just kind of permanently being a bigger part of the equation? Any thoughts there?
A- Richard Wallace: Jim, good question. I think that we really don't understand, overall, how that dynamic has shifted. But what we do see is, NAND's will have to invest if they want to keep up their percent of the overall market. As we said, they've under invested. But it's really hard to see how long this NAND play will continue to go. As there continues to be this huge demand pushing both NAND and also, we see DRAM increasing. So, it is a good question. We haven't really modeled the long-term change but we expect over a few quarters that we might have a better sense of what that is looking like. And of course, now as you know, the foundries are coming into NAND, so they will get part of that business as well.
Q - James Covello: Great. One quick follow-up from me, I don't think I understood the tax rate for June?
A - Jeffrey Hall: About 20%.
Q - James Covello: Okay. And so that implies -- if I work through your model then, your gross margins are up very significantly in June, is that a fair way to think about it?
A - Jeffrey Hall: You've got a model there.
Q - James Covello: Thank you.
A- Richard Wallace: Trust your math.
Q - James Covello: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Q - Brett Hodess: Rick, given the number of new products that you're talking about, there are 65 nanometer production and 45 nanometer development; can you give us an idea how far you think you're ahead at this point in some of these products versus competition? And if you think you're going to get some additional price and margin leverage from the new rollouts here?
A - Richard Wallace: Hi Greg, great question. I think there are definitely opportunities for us. From my standpoint, it's less about competition and more about meeting some of these new unmet needs especially as it relates to advances in lithography and some of the challenges that people are facing with some of the new materials. But I do think we're in a position to increase our share, especially when it comes to the metrology area, where I think we've got some real opportunities there. But the inspection business continues to look good for us. And I think we're working very closely with our customers on some of these advanced challenges.
Q - Brett Hodess: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Deahna with JP Morgan.
Q - Jay Deahna: Thank you, good afternoon. A couple of questions. First of all, Rick, you talked about in your opening remarks, process control. I think you said a growing portion of fab investments. Does that imply you believe the percentage of CapEx on equipment in a fab at 65 to 45 for process control is more than it was at 90 and 130? That's number one. And then number two, you talked about customers transitioning their volume purchases from 90 to 65 later this year and foundry is picking up. You've got a bigger outlook for CapEx. Does that imply that you expect orders for the industry to be up in the third and fourth quarter? And specifically, KLA always has this issue where September is the first quarter of the fiscal year. I wonder if you could give some color on your order potential in the third calendar quarter? Thank you.
A- Richard Wallace: Okay, hi Jay, two good questions. Let me take them in order. First, your percent question on process control, we do see that trend increasing. And I think it relates specifically to some of the new challenges people are facing as they go to 65. And we anticipate 45 to be more challenging. And again, that's -- in terms of the advanced design rules, the new materials, the deep subway length litho, we do see increased opportunities, and that increases the tam for process control. In terms of the second half, it looks very good to us right now. I think you know during this part of the cycle, we are still early in this transition to 300 millimeter. And there are lot of fabs that still have to build out and come online and we're anticipating increases in 2007, with a lot of new fabs being planned for 2007. And of course, that means we would see those bookings in the second half. You talked about September, historically, that's been a down quarter for KLA-Tencor. But I'll tell you what we see right now, is September looks good for us and we're very positive on the rest of the year.
Q - Jay Deahna: Does that mean it's up?
A- Richard Wallace: I said September looks very good for us. And as you know, Jay, we don't forecast out six months but certainly a lot of good signs out there.
Q - Jay Deahna: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Q - Edward White: Thanks. Rick, you talked a little bit about 45 nanometers. Can you talk more about what some of the issues are likely to be at 45 nanometers? And specifically, how your new products may be able to address those issues better than say some of the competitive offerings out there?
A- Richard Wallace: Ed good question. Thank you for that question. I think there's a couple of things happening at 45 nanometers. A lot of new materials coming in. Our customers are, in particular, dealing with two fundamental issues, especially as it relates to the logic. And that is one is the power management. And I think that's stressing new materials, which creates new yield challenges. And that really plays to the flexibility of our product suite particularly things like our broadband DCV inspection system. The other thing that's going on is pushing the lithography, and whether it's 45 or 32, the push toward immersion is going to continue to create new challenges for us. And I think those are going to be both in metrology and also challenges in defectivity. And I think it's not just our new products, but our applications understanding and the close collaboration we have with our customers that positions us well to meet those needs as we go forward.  Lastly, I think that the NAND flash push is pushing design rules. And of course, there's a need for ramping yield quickly, and that also plays to some of our strength as well. So, we feel very good about the new technologies coming on and how they play into our portfolio.
Q - Edward White: Great. Thank you.
A- Richard Wallace: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timm Schulze-Melander with Morgan Stanley.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Hi, good afternoon guys and congratulations on a good quarter. Just a quick question I mean you've obviously got a lot of moving parts that are going to come through here in the second half, new products et cetera. How much volatility should we or variation should we anticipate in the gross margin? Thank you.
A - Jeffrey Hall: Gross margin, best way for us, doesn't really -- hasn't really changed, 60% to 70% incremental gross margin is how we're going to model our business going forward. We continue to drive the nitty, gritty details to get there. So, I think that's the right way to look at it.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Okay, so, even if you have quarters where you've got sort of increasing contribution from new products and some of those associated costs with low volumes maybe initially, we shouldn't expect you to deviate from that range?
A - Jeffrey Hall: No, I think, 50% to 70% is our number. What we've executed to, it's what we're going to continue to execute to.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Fitzgerald with Banc of America.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald: Thanks. The way you guys are handling options, by giving us such detail, seems to suggest you think there's an argument for excluding options but when you look at all of your other major equipment companies out there, AMAT, LAN, Novell, so everybody has gone to this method of just including options. So I'm curious why you kind of continue to fight the FASB accounting rules here?
A - John Kispert: Mark, John Kispert. I wouldn't say we're fighting anything, we're just giving what people asked us to give. If you want one flavor, I'll give it to you that way. If you want it a different flavor, we'll give it to a different way. You clearly want it in, I'll make a note of that.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald: Well, I'm saying this for comp purposes, everybody else in the industry has gone this way. I'm not sure why you guys are doing it differently at this point.
A - John Kispert: Mark Fitzgerald wants it in, I got it.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald: And then just one quick question. The 7% tax rate for the current quarter, could you give me a quick explanation of that?
A - Jeffrey Hall: As we've been saying, we've a lot of audits and statute expiring around the world. So we saw a few things close out, we true-up our tax accounts in the quarter, we get a small benefit here in the current quarter.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald: Okay. And would the tax rate of 20% for '07 be a good estimate?
A - Jeffrey Hall: Yes, we think going forward, 20%.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike O'Brien with Bear Stearns.
Q - Michael O'Brien: Yes, thanks a lot. Just a couple things. First on NAND, I think Rick, you had said, see how long this lasts or something to that affect. Are you getting worried -- I know there's a lot of worry on the Street, by some of a collapse in NAND spending or NAND ordering in the second half. Do you subscribe to that? And then where you said September looks quite good, is it across the board, or is it specifically in memory foundry, Japan, or whoever else you might want to qualify it? Thanks.
A- Richard Wallace: Mike, thanks for those questions. First one on NAND, I think that what's clear is there's increasing demand that has been running now for some period of time at 200% bit rate growth per year. And that looks like it continues as there's just more and more applications. So, our expectations are is that this thing has a lot of legs in it. And the NAND manufacturing, those guys are still profitable and we're certainly getting a lot of requests to support the -- a lot of new projects that extend out into 2007. In terms of the September quarter and beyond, we have pretty -- early visibility is still ways off, but we do see a pretty robust across all the sectors and the regions all look pretty reasonable to us. So, I wouldn't point to one particular area, other than to say that I think memory continues its strength, but it's not just NAND, it's also the DRAM capability. And the anticipation of a lot of expected demand in 2007 as new operating systems come out. And also that NAND kind of taken away some of the memory capacity that had been there in the past. So, I think we're kind of getting an effect from that as well.
Q - Michael O'Brien: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Marisa Hernandez with UBS.
Q - Marisa Hernandez: Hi, good afternoon. It looks like orders from Korea receded this quarter, and I was wondering whether you could share with us what your expectations for Korea are for June orders?
A- Richard Wallace: Yeah I think I misspoke earlier. The Korea orders are up. I was looking at two lines here. Korea order expectations are up, and again driven they came in strong last quarter. This quarter, they've got a kind of a breather as they absorb some of that, but next quarter looks very good for us.
Q - Marisa Hernandez: Okay, great. And then regarding memory orders in the June quarter, would you expect the split between DRAM and NAND to be about the same?
A- Richard Wallace: Yeah, looks like it to us. And again, as you know, there's some mixed use fabs, but the NAND capacity just keeps coming.
Q - Marisa Hernandez: Okay. And I didn't catch your comments regarding logic outlook for June. Could you comment on that?
A - Jeffrey Hall: Yeah, what we see in logic is actually June to be a little bit lighter than our historical average, somewhere in the 25% range. And we've run historically somewhere around 33, so little bit down. We do see memory, as I said, to be up as the 50% kind of range for the June quarter.
Q - Marisa Hernandez: Sorry, did you say 30% range for logic in June?
A - Jeffrey Hall: The logic at about 25% range.
Q - Marisa Hernandez: 25% range.
A - Jeffrey Hall: For June and it was 37 this last quarter.
Q - Marisa Hernandez: Okay, great, thank you very much.
A - Jeffrey Hall: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Hsueh with CIBC World Markets.
Q - Gary Hsueh: Great, thanks for taking my question. If I look at your bookings in December and March and I divide that or normalize that by the total market opportunity in inspection and metrology; it tells me that you're running at roughly north of 60% the mid 60% range. And if I plot this out historically, you typically can't sustain a level above your natural market share of around 45% to 50% for more than a quarter or two. So I'm just on a curious about this ratio. What makes you think that you can kind of sustain it as through these percentage levels in the back half of the year? Is there anything from a product perspective? Are you getting share in any end kind of customers on the back half that might make this year different from any other past historical cycles?
A- Richard Wallace: Yeah, well, I think there are couple of things. It's a good question. One is, as we look out at, first of all, our sense of market share is that we've actually been holding our market share, but we do believe there are opportunities to gain share. So, we actually don't believe this already gone up. We think there's actually potential for it to go up. And the reason we think that is we've got strong new products in our initial entries with those products in the leading edge fabs are showing very good results. So, we're pretty confident that we'll be able to extend that out as people fan those in the manufacturing. So from that standpoint, and I think it is based on being close to the customers, working with them, and building products that they need to support the very difficult challenges that they're facing. So, I think we do have room for share expansion as we go forward.
Q - Gary Hsueh: But do you think the fanout potential is in the second half of this year or the fanout potential is more in '07?
A- Richard Wallace: I think it's gradual. It starts in the second half and keeps building in '07.
Q - Gary Hsueh: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Maire with Needham & Company.
Q - Robert Maire: All right, congratulations on the nice numbers. In terms of foundries, they've been, as you pointed out unusually conservative and we heard from TSMC this morning that they're running at close to 100%. Do you think this is just a new culture change that goes on forever? And kind of related to that is sort of a follow-up question. In terms of your planning for the remainder of the year and going forward, do you have a point in time at which you think the foundries start to spend again, or is your current going forward assumption that they stay at this low sort of below historical norm, or historical average, 20% level for the foreseeable future?
A- Richard Wallace: First of all Robert, thanks for the comments at the front end of that and thanks for the question. In terms of the foundry, we do model them up a little bit, but relative to what we just booked in the March quarter. But what we don't see is them returning to historical level and we have it modeled that out for the rest of the year. And we think we can still see a pretty strong rest of the year without that happening. Now, in terms of when they return, I don't have a crystal ball. It's very hard to see. So what we focus on is being available to support their needs, having the right products for them, and making sure that we can respond to what has historically been a very quick cycle when they do decide to spend. They tend not to have a lot of visibility and so we tend to have to be very flexible and meet their needs. And we've been we’re going to be there for them when they do turn on. But we're not modeling a lot of upside out of foundries from the current run rates now.
Q - Robert Maire: So just to try to interrupt that, you're modeling sort in the low 20's.
A- Richard Wallace: Right around 25%.
Q - Robert Maire: Okay, thank you.
A- Richard Wallace: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stuart Muter with RBC.
Q - Stuart Muter: Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. Just a fairly quick one for Rick first on reticle inspection. With the new STARlight-2 tool, do you expect a kind of surge in orders over the next couple of quarters for that tool, because often you get a surge in reticle inspection associated with certain shrinks?
A- Richard Wallace: We have -- you have to understand that these products, when we announced them is different when they're introduced. And we've had some of these tools with our key customers. So we don't see reticle going up necessarily above the level that we reported for the last quarter. We think it stays in the 15% to 20% range for the next couple of quarters. That being said, it's a very important segment for our customers and especially as they bring out these new devices with advanced RET technology. The other thing that's impacting us, of course, is we are seeing some reticle opportunities in the fab. And we believe that will continue to grow and we think there's more opportunity there as well. So, we don't see a surge as a percentage, but it definitely contributes to the overall story.
Q - Stuart Muter: Okay, that's helpful. And then a question for John. In terms of your shipments, you're getting up pretty high. Are you getting to a point where some customers are getting concerned about lead-time and your ability to meet requests for shipment?
A - John Kispert: No, I think we're doing a pretty good job there. It is not easy, as orders have kind of accelerated here. We're working very hard. Our cycle times in manufacturing with these newer products have come down about 30% in the last month or so. And I think there's probably another 30% that we can take them down over the coming months. So, so far, we're meeting everything. You know this business, there's always pressure to meet quicker turns. But we can turn anything within maybe a 60-day period. And that's really where our leading-edge customers are focused right now, is in that kind of a time period -- cycle time.
Q - Stuart Muter: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shekhar Pramanick with Moors & Cabot.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: Good afternoon. Two-part question. Rick, you are the most bullish regarding third quarter, particularly about your business in terms of orders. Is that particularly we should read into it, a particular place you're doing really well? And my second part question is that clearly you're holding a market share in different segments, but is there any segment, any geography where you think competition have had a better luck? Thanks.
A- Richard Wallace: Let me start with the first part of -- the end of that question, which was competition. We have stiff competition everywhere and I've been here 18 years and that's been the case. And we expect that to continue. But it drives us harder. And so there's not a particular area, my view is they're everywhere. And we have to keep hard -- working hard to maintain and grow our share. In terms of September, why am I, why I sound bullish? We have a lot of new products that we've just introduced. Those products are going through acceptance and customers are responding favorably to that. So, I think it gives us new opportunity for continuing to expand those footprints as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Prudential Financial.
Q - Ben Pang: Hi, thank you for taking my question. A couple of questions here. First, in terms of the growth rate of the process control business, is that primarily still 80% driven by inspection? Is there any growth on the metrology side?
A- Richard Wallace: Yes, there's definitely growth on metrology side. There's a lot of new materials, new stacks, transistors becoming more complicated, overlay. And this is not even factoring in as people go to the sublet exposure overlay, which will create more opportunities soon.
Q - Ben Pang: So, should we expect in the future that the order rates for the metrology are going to start going up as a percentage of the overall orders?
A- Richard Wallace: That's what I'm expecting. So, I mean we're looking at this and we think there's more opportunity for it absolutely.
Q - Ben Pang: Okay. And the second question, also related to the growth rate, how much of the growth are you expecting due to pricing of the new tools?
A - Jeffrey Hall: Yeah. We see some growth there, but I think it's really a question of; can we continue to add more value into the product? So I think it's both an increased application and increased use case. But we have had good success with ASP growth when we add new value to our tools and we're continuing to focus on doing that. That of course becomes more important at 300 millimeter in particular, because our customers have the automation challenges. And so they want more capability on our tools and that drives us in that direction.
Q - Ben Pang: Okay and just a final question of clarification. On the tax rate for the quarter that just ended, on the -- like a continual operations basis, I guess the pro forma, it was 14%, is that right?
A - Jeffrey Hall: That's right.
Q - Ben Pang: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Q - Stephen O’Rourke: Hi, good afternoon. Could you comment on what you're seeing in the competitive front in Brightfield inspections, specifically, particularly with respect to Applied and TSK?
A- Richard Wallace: Yeah, sure, Steve. Thanks for the question. Well we see continued attempts to get into that market, because of the criticality of it and the growing uses for Brightfield. But we have done very well with our 2,800 series product. And I think we are uniquely positioned with our broadband DPV there. Added to that, with the product I just talked about earlier today, the 2367 gives us the real high speed capability and still great sensitivity. So, we like our position in Brightfield. But as always, there are people that are pressuring and trying to get into the space. But we've done well in our head-to-head and continue to enjoy good market share there. But we've got to work for it.
Q - Stephen O’Rourke: Fair enough. And one follow-up. How much of your orders were for 65 nanometers or below?
A - Jeffrey Hall: I modeled it somewhere about 30%, which is up from where it's been of course. And we see that number going up as people start getting confidence in their ability to yield and they'll start ramping up the 65 nanometer line.
Q - Stephen O’Rourke: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up question from Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Hi guys, actually I had two. If I try to project, based upon your bookings will be in June. And I try to project what your shipments will probably be into September. And if I just -- that's kind of already lock in based upon what the bookings are. And if I just flat line that shipment into December, your shipments are going to be up about 35%, 40% year-over-year. If you take some of the other companies like ALAM or some of the other companies out there, the year-over-year growth rate for them just kind of flat lining it out during the back half of the year, is up something like 50%. So, we're seeing equipment this year grow north of 40% year-over-year. How do you think about that holistically relative to the argument that spending out there is pretty rational right now? Thanks.
A- Richard Wallace: I think the first thing you said is, flat line shipments. We don't see flat line shipments. We think shipments are going to continue to grow. We're entering the second half here with 20% plus more backlog than we had entering the first half. So, we think we're going to continue to grow shipments.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Right, right. Well, I guess that's my point. That if you historically look at year-over-year growth rates and what causes what kind of kills a cycle, so to speak. If you look at year-over-year growth rates and equipment near 50%, that's historically killed a semiconductor cycle. So I guess if you think that your shipments are going to grow again in December, it kind of further argues the point, right?
A - John Kispert: You're assuming that the demand in 2007 backs down and what we see is a lot of activity out in 2007. We think spending will be up and the tools that we're going to book and ship towards the, at the end of the calendar year are going into start headed towards the new facilities.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Okay and last thing for Jeff. Jeff, what's the trigger to get the products that are inventory to move them to shipments or deferred revenue? Thanks.
A - Jeffrey Hall: Customer -- we release it and the customer signs off, it goes, book, ship, and revenue real quick.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up question from Jay Deahna with JP Morgan.
Q - Jay Deahna: Thank you. Two questions. The first one is, with Rick and John now running the company versus Ken and Gary 1.5 year ago or so, what do you view as your top three priorities here and how are they different than the previous regime? That's the first question. Then the second question is, we can look at the change in year-over-year growth rates and this, that, and the other, but at the end of the day, it looks like the capital spending ratio this year is probably going to be about 19% or 20% in total. 16.5% to 17% excluding flash. That seems pretty reasonable to me. Just wondering what your sense is on that? And that's it.
A- Richard Wallace: Jay, great question. And let me take it in a couple of ways. We start with the -- what's the new management looking forward to and what's our sense of priorities and how we're going to run the company going forward? I think there are three things to think about in terms of that. First of all, we are in a great space. Process control, there's a growing need for it, a lot of drivers for it. 300 millimeter conversions are driving us, we have 65-nanometer technology and beyond and all the new materials that are coming on. So, our modeling says process control over the next several years continues to grow faster than CapEx in general. And we've got a lot of analysis to support that. The second one is we're in a strong position, but we also believe there's upside. And there's upside in terms of market expansion, market share expansion. And that has to do with a couple of things. One, is we've got new products and we've got new opportunities through organic growth. We are adopting strategy, as you've seen with the ADE announcement of strategic M&A to help build out our product portfolio. And we think there's opportunities to expand profitably in metrology. And the opportunity to grow from a standpoint of an overall percent of a growing market. And the last one, we are pretty confident of our business model. We've got the best business model in the industry. But as we've look at the last four months, we actually see opportunities to improve upon that business model going forward. And I think there's not only top line growth we can drive, but through the business, throughout the organization and the company, we see ways to drive our bottom line growth and actually grow earnings faster than we grow the top line. So, from the standpoint of what John and I and the rest of the team are focused on, it's really those three things. One is playing out our position in a very strong space. Second, is leveraging our market position and growing it. And lastly, improving on the business model and delivering more earnings. So that's the -- those are the three main things we're focused on. In terms of your question about the percent spend, I think your math is right. I agree with that, it's a very rational upturn. And from our perception, it's got a lot of legs in it. From our last - looking back and the previous one, and John, I've been doing this a while, three different cycles, we see a lot of legs here and we're probably two quarters into what historically could be a 10 or 12 quarter run in terms of the overall cycle. So, we like our position and we like where the industry is right now.
Q - Jay Deahna: Okay a quick follow-up, if I could. The first one is, on your ability to grow your earnings faster than your revenues. We've seen a number of new products introduced recently and probably several more between now and SemiCon West for 65 and 45 nanometers. Can you start to harvest some of that from an OpEx perspective into some margin leverage? And going forward here for the next year or so, do you see more margin leverage coming from gross or operating or some sort of a combination? And the last question is, John if you could hop in here and give us your perspective, your view of the company, or the market or whatever from your new position and how you view differently? Thanks.
A- Richard Wallace: Let me take the first part of that and then give John the second part. First of all, we've talked a lot in the past about our leverage on the gross margin, incremental gross margin, but we think as importantly, is the leverage on the operating margin. And that's an area that we've focused a lot on. And you're right, we do see opportunity, and I think we see short-term. But more importantly, what we see as long-term sustainable improvement in that overall business model. And that's what we're really focused on. And that's a lot of what John is going to be focused. And let him take that part of it.
A - John Kispert: Jay, I think we're at a part of the cycle where we've been before, which, we're pushing real hard to increase our shipments. We see customers that, as they're making transitions, we're encountering newer defects and newer measurements that we're fortunately positioned well for. Our focus right now is on 45-nanometer, frankly, as far as next generation products and the things that we need to be positioned for. I think we're in really good shape for the 65 nanometer transition. The newer products that you'll hear about in the next couple of quarters are all focused on the 45 nanometer challenges. And those are exciting. I'm sure you've spent a lot of time on the litho issues. And that plays very well to our inspection portfolio and our metrology portfolio. The changes in the transistor with materials we talked a lot about. And as Rick mentioned before, that in and of itself will drive a bunch of metrology business that we've been focused on for as far as our private portfolio for the last year or so. So, we think we're well positioned. Now, it's about execution and that's really what we're going to be focused on for the next 6 to 9 months.
Q - Jay Deahna: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth with Cowen & Company.
Q - Raj Seth: Thank you. Rick, in answer to a couple previous questions, you talked about an increase in fab projects in '07. I'm curious if you can quantify what you're seeing? I know it's early. But how many projects, greenfield projects, do you see out there? How does that compare with this year? How many are memory, how many are logic?
A- Richard Wallace: Yeah, good question. We model right now, there's about 55 active 300 millimeter projects going on around the world. It ranges quite a bit. When we look forward to '07 and again, no crystal ball, but as we look out there and talk to customers and model it, we see somewhere around 15, which is significantly up from what's happened in 2006. A lot of 2006 has been about really build-out of fabs that were built previously. But we do see new greenfield opportunities, as I said, on the order of 15. And we see about 11 of those being focused on memory. So, there's still a lot of opportunity there as well.
Q - Raj Seth: Thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Pelayo with Soleil Securities.
Q - Steven Pelayo: I'm just trying to understand your guys gave guidance here. If we look at it just purely on a GAAP basis, you talk about $0.12 on expense, so that's $0.68 to $0.71 is really somewhere around $0.56 to $0.59 or so. I think the midpoint of revenue is called up 10% about 570. You talked about a 20% tax rate, assuming OpEx is maybe up 5% when revenues were up 10%. The last lever to pull there is gross margin. So, it's really going back to Jim Covello's question. You responded with, you have a model. It doesn't seem to work here. It would imply that to get into the midpoint of that bottom EPS line guidance, that you'd have to have like an 85% drop-through in incremental gross margin. That's almost 59% gross margins, to make it work. Is that what you guys are effectively saying here or do I just -- somehow the math isn't working for me?
A - Jeffrey Hall: I think the math isn't working for you. $0.60 to $0.70 incremental gross margin, I think maybe you're maybe a little high on fixed costs. We said no more than 2% or 3% in fixed costs from here. And it drops through at about $0.70.
Q - Steven Pelayo: And once again, a 20% tax rate on a GAAP basis?
A - Jeffrey Hall: Yeah, I'm sorry, operating is what I'm looking at. So GAAP, a little bit lower than 20%.
Q - Steven Pelayo: That's where I think I probably need to make up most of it. Excellent, that's all I need. Thank you guys.
A - Jeffrey Hall: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gus Richard with First Albany Capital.
Q - Gus Richard: Hey guys, when I go and look at the foundry market, it looks like 0.13 and 18 is really, really tight. 90 doesn't look quite as bad. As we get a shift from maybe memory and microprocessor towards foundry, is the incremental spend going to be as much per square inch of silicone?
A - John Kispert: Hi, Gus, John Kispert. Yes, it's generally about the same. It all depends on the device, as you know in foundry. Particular foundry might be really focused on, but generally, I think the way to think about it is the adoption rate for process control for KLA-Tencor is about the same.
Q - Gus Richard: I was talking just total CapEx, but it's the same for process control as well?
A - John Kispert: Yes.
Q - Gus Richard: Got it. All right, thanks.
A- Richard Wallace: Hi Derek, I think we've got time for one more question here.
Operator: Your final question is a follow-up question from Timm Schulze-Melander with Morgan Stanley.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Great, thank you. Maybe just one thing, on behalf of everybody on the Street, just wanted to wish Cary Halsted all the best on his retirement. And then I had two quick follow-ups. The first was could you just repeat this best for the most quarter orders between logic memory and foundry? And secondly, how should we model as Japan increases importance, how should we model the changing relationship between shipments and revenues? Thank you.
A- Richard Wallace: Okay I'll take the first part and let Jeff take the second. We said that the split in March quarter was 20% foundry, 37% logic, 43% in memory. And of the memory, we said 50% was NAND and 50% was DRAM. And Jeff?
A - Jeffrey Hall: Timm, on the second one, I don't see any change on our business model going forward.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Okay, great. Very helpful.
Richard Wallace, Chief Executive Officer: I'd like to thank you all for participating in the conference call today. Our next conference call is currently scheduled for July 27th and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.

Rick Wallace, Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, John and thank you for joining our second quarter FY '06 earnings call. Today I will be talking to you about the current environment and our outlook for 2006, an update on KLA-Tencor products, the financial highlights for the December quarter and our guidance for the March quarter. Jeff Hall will then take you through the details of December results and then we will take your questions. 2005 saw a bottoming of orders for semiconductor capital equipment in the March and June quarters with strong growth re-established in December. KLA-Tencor revenue grew in 2005 in spite of the decrease in capital spending by semiconductor fabs. Our customers continued to invest in process control to speed their yield learning on 90-nanometer and ensure the qualification of next generation 65-nanometer fabs. The outlook for 2006 is even brighter. Semiconductor revenues are expected to grow a little faster in 2006 than the 7% growth of 2005. Most forecasts are in the range of 8 to 10% growth per semi revenues. While capital expenditures decreased in 2005, we expect them to grow in the range of 5 to 10% in 2006. The drivers for growth continue to be the transition to new 300-millimeter fabs, the growth of consumer electronics and the 200% bit growth of NAND. Memory was the strongest segment in the December quarter with significant NAND flash spending. But for the year as a whole, both memory and logic were above their long-term averages in 2005. Foundry was the lowest segment in 2005 at 24% of bookings but increased to 30% in December. While foundry increased orders from the low point of June, they are still below their average and we would expect them to increase orders as we go through 2006. Although most of the increase in booking comes from additions to current manufacturing capacities, our new tools are having great acceptance in 65-nanometer fabs where the yield learning challenges are the greatest. Our 2800 Brightfield inspection tool has won awards, head-to-head comparisons with competitive tools, orders, and repeat orders in 65-nanometer fabs. With its superior performance in capturing all types of defect, the 2800 is becoming the standard tool for yield learning at 65-nanometer. Our Puma 9000 darkfield inspection tool has demonstrated the highest defect capture at the highest throughputs, D-RAM, flash, and logic manufacturers all ordered Puma tools this quarter for their 90-nanometer manufacturing fabs as well as 65-nanometer yield learning. Measurement of critical dimensions at 65-nanometers is a major yield challenge for our customers as they need to make more measurements to control the shrinking lithography process window and they need to make new types of measurements such as image profiles. Our Spectra CD optical CD tool is finding increased adoption in 65-nanometer fabs as it makes all the measurements required at higher speeds and lower cost per measurement. Our E-beam based ECD 2 is also increasing its adoption at 65-nanometer as it provides better productivity through automation and matching and better measurements on difficult to measure structures. Staying on Moore's Law presents many technical and financial challenges to our customers and as 2006 proceeds, those challenges will start to come from 45-nanometer. We have been investing in the development of a complete suite of inspection and measurement products for 45-nanometers and we will introduce many of them in the first half of 2006. Now turning to the financial highlights for the December quarter. Our net orders were 513 million, up 17% from September. Revenue of $488 million was up $4 million from last quarter. Net income was $102 million or $0.50 per diluted share excluding non-cash equity based compensations. Including equity compensation net income was $77 million or $0.38 per diluted share. The same as the September quarter. Orders grew in December as our customers increased their investment in process control for leading edge capacity ramps and for yield learning at 65-nanometer. Looking ahead to the March quarter our guidance is as follows. Bookings in the range of up 15% plus or minus 10%. Revenue to be between 500 million and $510 million. And EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.57 per share. Now Jeff will provide the details for bridging this operating EPS to GAAP EPS. We look forward to a second quarter of strong growth in our business. Our customers have been investing prudently in capacity over the last year. Fab utilization is at very high levels and customers have near term and strategic needs for increased 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity. Process control continues to be a growing part of their investment. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff Hall.
Jeff Hall, Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Rick. As Rick discussed, we are seeing an increasing level of bookings as our customers ramp 60-nanometer production capacity and 65-nanometer yield learning. As a result of this increasing demand from our customers we have begun to increase our production levels after three flat quarters. Turning to the quarter, let me remind you that we implemented FAS 123R in the September quarter and therefore the results we announced earlier today reflect the expensing of share based compensation. As you know, the implementation of FAS 123R impacts our financial statements in numerous ways. Which means current GAAP results are not comparable to those of previous years. Therefore consistent with the current Last Call I will focus my comments on the operating P&L, that is excluding share base compensation. And I will then discuss the impact share base compensation had on those results. We believe this approach best meets the needs of investors and analysts for comprehensive, compliant, and comparable data. As Rick mentioned, net bookings for the December ending quarter were 513 million which is roughly 17% higher than the September ending quarter and 7% higher than one year ago. This number also includes $4.7 million of orders that have been debooked in accordance with our booking policy that restricts actual booking to a set criteria. The set criteria mandates that technical specifications are signed off. Valid terms and conditions are finalized and delivery is scheduled within 12 months. We ended the quarter with approximately $755 million worth of backlog for unshipped orders. Remember, we do not include any service, consignment, or unreleased systems in this backlog number. This order of order backlog allows us to smooth our factory utilization and provide predictable execution from our supply chain. In addition, we have $412 million of deferred revenue that is related to products that have been shipped but not signed off by customers. This is invoiced systems revenue deferred under SAB 104. It includes no service revenue and is made up of tools delivered but awaiting written acceptance from the customer. We remain confident that we have a strong backlog shippable over the next six to nine months and our ability to maintain this significant level of both shipment and revenue backlog continues to help KLA-Tencor sustain profitability throughout any business cycle. The regional distribution of orders for the December quarter was as follows. The U.S. was 17%. Lower than its historical average of 25%. Taiwan was 18%, lower than its historical average of 20%. Korea, China, and Singapore combined were 32%, higher than their historical average of 20%. Europe was 12%. Lower than its historical average of 15%. And Japan was 21%. Slightly higher than its historical average of 20%. The product distribution of orders was, wafer inspection was approximately 45%. Reticle inspection was 23%. Metrology was 13%. Data storage was 2% and service was 17%. Turning to the income statement, revenue for the quarter was 488 million. Up about 1% quarter to quarter and down 8% from the same quarter last year. Gross margin was 56.9% for the quarter compared to 57.1% in the prior quarter. Operating expenses including both SG&A and R&D were 165 million. This expense level was up 2% quarter to quarter consistent with our forecast. This reflects our discipline in maintaining a balanced cost structure while we continue to focus on investing in new engineering programs and increasing application support of 300-millimeter ramps around the world. For the quarter, other income was $16.7 million and the effective tax rate was 21.8%. For FY '06 we anticipate that our tax rate will continue to be approximately 20%, plus or minus a few points depending on the renewal of the R&D tax credit and the resolution of various tax audits currently underway in multiple jurisdictions around the world. Net income for the December quarter was 102.5 million or $0.50 per diluted share. The impact of non-cash equity based compensation reduces this number by $0.12 per share and the approximate breakout is as follows. Cost of goods sold, $0.03. R&D $0.06. SG&A $0.08 and there was a tax benefit of o$0.05. In the March quarter we expect ongoing expense for share based compensation to also be about $0.12 the same as it has been for the last five years. We also expect to have an additional $0.03 to $0.04 of share based compensation as a one-time charge related to the retirement of our prior CEO. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and investments ended the quarter at 2.2 billion an increase of 44 million quarter to quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased stock valued at approximately 49 million and paid a dividend of 24 million. Inventory increased by 16 million to 412 million. This inventory growth can be attributed to increases in raw materials and work in process as we began to significantly ramp our production facilities during the quarter. Accounts receivable finished the quarter at 372 million, up 65 million from September. The increase from the previous quarter is attributable to higher revenue in Japan where normal payment terms are longer than in other regions. Capital additions related to fixed assets were approximately 18 million for the quarter. And depreciation was 13 million. So on a net basis including retirements, fixed asset increased by 5 million over the quarter. Head count ended the December quarter at 5570. Up 130 from September, mostly to support our production increases, field support, and new product introductions. In summary, we have had flat shipments in revenue over the past three quarters and are just now starting to increase production and shipment. And as a result of our backlog management we have been able to continue to fund our advanced development projects. So as revenue increases we will be able to keep our operating expenses near current levels, creating strong incremental margins going forward. This concludes our remarks on the quarter. We will now open the call for questions. Before I turn the call over, let me request that you refrain from asking multipart questions to give others some time. As always we are all on a tight schedule. Can you begin the polling, please.
Questions & Answers:
Operator:
Operator Instructions:
Q - Suresh Balaraman: Rick, you talked about the industry growth at 5 to 10% for CapEx. Any thoughts on how the PBC segment should grow in 2006? Thanks.
A - Rick Wallace: Yes. What we see in 2005, let's start with that, process control, KLA-Tencor grew at about 6% and the industry was down 4%. We think that trend of continuing to see growth expansion as a percent of the total capital will continue and our estimates now is that KT and process control should be able to grow at about 5% faster than industry CapEx. So if we end up at 8%, of course that would put us at 13, anywhere 13 to 15%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Edward White with Lehman Brothers.
Q - Edward White: Hi, was wondering if you could characterize the customer climate right now? Clearly a better environment than we have seen during the early part of last year. But as you look at their plans and what they are trying to do, how would you characterize the environment to give some sense as to sustainability?
A - Rick Wallace: Hi, Ed, thanks for the question. I think that the customers are -- have been very I guess cautious, prudent in their investments. But now are more optimistic than they have been in sometime and we are seeing that reflecting in the order activity. I would say that they are more positive. We do see the right kind of discussions happening. If you go back nine months the discussions were about capital expense and operate expense and now it's more about slots and support and how we can get tools to meet their needs. I think it's gotten more positive and we expect that to go on for sometime. Generally at this phase of the ramp, this is pretty early in a ramp and especially one that has had such modest investment levels coming off of modest investment and plus you have got high capital -- high utilization going on, now too. So pretty positive and pretty much across the board. The one area that hasn't really turned on or we don't forecast turning on is foundries which have been below their historical average.
Q - Edward White: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with Citigroup.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Hi, actually I had two quick things. Number one, can you tell us what the shipments were and can you guide shipments? Thanks.
A - Rick Wallace: The shipments for the quarter were 450 and looking forward, looking for 530 in the next quarter.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then last thing for me, you gave us the orders by foundry, you said that 30% of the bookings were foundry can you complete that and give us what the percent for logic and also memory. Thanks. And if you can break memory out by D-RAM and flash possibly.
A - Rick Wallace: Yes. Sure.. So we said that we had about 28% of logic. Foundry was about 30% and memory was at 42 and about 50% of the memory business was NAND.
Q - Timothy Arcuri: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Lu with Piper Jaffray.
Q - Bill Lu: Congrats on a nice quarter. Just a quick question. The midpoint of the guidance puts you at 590 for bookings next quarter or for this current quarter. Assuming that it stays about that level or above, how would revenue trend for the rest of this year?
A - John Kispert: Bill, John Kispert. Tough to tell. Obviously it goes up. With SAB nowadays it's when the customers actually sign off on it and as you know we have a lot of systems out there that need to get signed off. We have a lot of new product introductions that we've shipped that are still in our inventory too that will get signed off. I would say it's going to get higher as you get out into the June quarter. Again, difficult to tell exactly how much higher until we get actually into the quarter and we are talking to customers about what they are going to accept.
Q - Bill Lu: So if I compare the shipment to revenue conversion rate now versus a year or two years ago it would be about the same?
A - John Kispert: Shipment to revenue conversion rate, I'm not sure exactly what that means, Bill.
Q - Bill Lu: Just acceptance I guess, SAB 101 acceptance.
A - John Kispert: Yes. My point is I think it's difficult to draw on anything historic in this environment. We've shipped a lot more out there the last couple of quarters than you normally would in a flatter period like this. Some of this stuff is going to get signed off. I don't know if it's the June quarter or the following quarter in September is the answer and I don't know how to give you an algorithm to close on to.
Q - Bill Lu: Okay. Thanks a lot.
A - John Kispert: Other than I think it will be higher than the run rate we just gave you.
Q - Bill Lu: Got it.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse First Boston.
Q - John Pitzer: Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. First, when you start looking at bookings numbers at these levels, this plus or minor 10% variance you put in your guidance is really now starting to become meaningful numbers. I think if you look at the guidance for March the difference between the high and the low end is about 130 million. Is there really that much variance in your business today or can you help us understand why you are giving such a wide range on that and then I have a quick follow-up.
A - John Kispert: Hey, John, John Kispert. It's really about a $60 million range the way I look at it. We told you 15%. If I just off the top of my head guess -- think about the number of opportunities we have for this quarter, I can think of four to maybe five opportunities that are well over $60 million. So the orders are much bigger in this environment. Why? Because there are more capacity buys at 300-millimeter. As we've talked about many times before we hate putting the Company at risk as far as trying pull in orders in the quarter to make a number. We feel real confident with the 15% and we see more upside than downside at this point. But 15% moving up from there is probably the best way to think about it.
Q - John Pitzer: Great. And then quickly, guys, typically you tend to weather the downturns better in the process equipment group but because of that you tend to undergrow sort of trough to peak. Help me understand what kind of alpha you guys might have to bridge that gap this time as the process equipment space begins to heat up.
A - John Kispert: Yes, I think there's two things and it's really the maturation of process control over the last five to ten years. Our adoption in production environments is much higher than what was, let's say in the four or five years ago. That is there's more inspection, more metrology per wafer per die. So that certainly will help us. The second piece that we've talked a lot about in the prior conference calls is our shipment level has been higher as we put out a lot of new products. And these are products we haven't announced yet. Over the next couple of quarters moving into Semicon West there will be more product introductions from KLA-Tencor around metrology and wafer inspection and a lot of those tools have been shipped already and so those -- and they're in our inventory right now. They are not in orders or revenue and those will turn on us to Bill's prior question too and that will certainly help growth on the high end.
Q - John Pitzer: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brett Hodess with Merrill Lynch.
Q - Brett Hodess: Good afternoon. Given the bookings and the shipment trends, it's pretty clear that you are going to go over your revenue peak from the last upturn. And in conjunction with that, with the rationalization you have been doing in your product platforms and whatnot, where are margins going to go? Last time we hit the peak it was like over 59% and it looks like you are going to be able to gain a lot of leverage. Can you talk a little bit about how we are supposed to model margins as we move into this upturn.
A - Jeff Hall: This is Jeff. Our business model still holds. As we grow revenue and shipments into this upturn we are going to continue to deliver 60 to 70% incremental gross margins. We are going to start to see cycle times come down by 20 to 30% here pretty quickly, cost across our supply train start to drop, our support costs per unit fall, and that drives us into the 60 to 70% that we continue to drive all of our businesses to.
Q - Brett Hodess: So given that, that says that where the revenue rates are likely to go to that you will pass through the 60% gross margin mark this year?
A - John Kispert: Brett, it all depends on obviously the top line. I mean, I don't know what you have in your modeling for our top line, but Jeff's point is whatever the top line is, you can add from this point going forward roughly 60 to 70% roughly incremental gross margin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve O'Rourke with Deutsche Bank.
Q - Steve O’Rourke: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I think you had commented that Taiwan is still pretty weak. Can you help us understand from your perspective what's going on with the foundries right now. I mean, TS&C this morning mentioned they were at 104% utilization. It seems like you should be seeing orders coming from this region.
A - Jeff Hall: It's a great question, Steve. We had 30% of our bookings last quarter were in foundry, but we said that that was below our historical average. And frankly in our March quarter we actually see it coming down from 30%. So they have been very cautious. The other factor with the foundries is we don't have a lot of visibility because they don't necessarily have a lot of visibility into their ordering pattern. And when they do order, they order big. So we are expecting sometime in 2006 that they are going to turn back on, but we are not modeling in the first quarter.
Q - Steve O’Rourke: Would this be one of these $60 million orders or so or is it bigger than that for KLA?
A - Jeff Hall: Well, it certainly wasn't in the 60 million I was referring to because it's not -- we don't see it there. But you'd have to ask them, Steve.
Q - Steve O’Rourke: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raj Seth with SG Cowen.
Q - Raj Seth: You mentioned you see foundry mix in March coming down. Can you tell us what you think logic and memory do as well and maybe tell us where they go.
A - Jeff Hall: Sure. Yes, as I said, foundry is somewhere around 25%. I think logic is also going to be around 25% and we think memory is going to be strong. What we see right now is memory around 50% probably 30% of that will be NAND. So we do see some significant D-RAM spending also in the March quarter.
Q - Raj Seth: Okay, thanks. A follow-on if I might, today how much of your business is driven by 65 and I'm curious as you have gotten more experience at that node, what do you think your opportunity is per fab relative to 90-nanometers at 65?
A - Jeff Hall: Yes, sure, about 30% of our business is at 65 and below right now. And there is increasing opportunity as we look forward. John has actually worked on this model. John, you want to take that one?
A - John Kispert: We have talked a lot through the years about a 90-nanometer and we expected about $250 million opportunity for us per fab as each fab actually fills out and fills up which has taken longer over the last couple of years. When we model the same -- and granted it's early for 65-nanometer, we see it increasing for us by about 20% to about 300 million per fab. Again, it's on average fab logic, memory, and foundry. And it's still early obviously, Raj. We haven't done a 65-nanometer fab yet so it's hard to tell.
Q - Raj Seth: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Maire with Needham & Company.
Q - Robert Maire: Yes. As NAND flash becomes a larger percentage of your business, are there any particular requirements that are different for NAND flash that change the concentration of product to NAND flash manufacturers or makes them more apt to spend earlier. Some of them are obviously running some relatively aggressive design rules here. Are they more aggressive in spending for metrology and causes control upfront? Could you give us a little into that?
A - Rick Wallace: Sure. The NAND is a great example of Moore's Law, pushing people to advance design rules and also at the same time they've got this time to market challenge. So we do see aggressive spending in order to ramp up and they are pushing their design rules harder especially now. So it's more the design rule phenomena than it is anything about the NAND process design per se, but they are running at leading edge and they have a very aggressive time horizon so ramping quickly is a big challenge for them as they go forward.
Q - Robert Maire: Is there any equipment mix differential in NAND towards one type of product or another that is different than a logic or foundry that you see?
A - Rick Wallace: No, not for us. Again, it's more based on the fact they are pushing the design rules forward.
Q - Robert Maire: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jay Deahna with JP Morgan.
Q - Jay Deahna: Two questions. The first one is, LAM gave a scenario of CapEx to be 7 to 10% up this year with wafer fab equipment up 15 to 17% and edge up more than that. The numbers you gave was process control compared to CapEx. Can you give us your sense as to where you see WFE versus CapEx and if process control can be above WFE?
A - Rick Wallace: Yes. I hear your question. We do think that process control is going to be above WFE in terms of modeling WFE at 15 to 17%. Boy, that would be great. I think that is a big number. But it's so far out. We are looking out. We can see margin gets a sense of what's going on in June, but beyond that it's pretty much speculation. Other than customer body language which as I said is positive.
Q - Jay Deahna: Rick, do you think that WFE though is higher than CapEx this year wherever it plays out because there is more equipment than bricks and mortar and then the second question that I had is do you think that the sequential growth rate in orders is likely to be higher in the second quarter calendar than it is in the first? And that's it for me.
A - Rick Wallace: Okay. I guess the first part of the question, I don't know. There is a lot of factors in there the test percentage that people are doing, different types of fabs. So not in a great position to talk about that. Second quarter what I can tell you is the June quarter for us has historically been stronger than the March quarter. And we don't see any reason why that that pattern would change this year.
Q - Jay Deahna: And you are referring to the growth rate and not the absolute level of bookings?
A - Rick Wallace: I'm referring to the absolute level of bookings, yes. Stronger June quarter. But obviously it depends -- we have this range and it depends where we end up inside of that range what kind of growth rate we see. But high utilization, a lot of customer confidence. So it feels pretty good.
Q - Jay Deahna: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Fitzgerald with Bank of America Securities.
Q - Mark Fitzgerald: Can you give us some idea as you ramp to the 500 million level what's happened with R&D and SG&A expenses?
A - Rick Wallace: Sure. Jeff..
A - Jeff Hall: Yes, I got it. Because of our backlog management we have been able to keep our funding for new projects high. So we -- at 165 million we don't think we have to increase much, 2, 3% from here as we move forward.
Q - Jay Deahna: SG&A?
A - Jeff Hall: Same. SG&A in the same range, 75 to 80 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Pang with Prudential Equity.
Q - Ben Pang: Question, a follow-up on the foundry situation. Can you give a little bit more color about why their mix is different because they still are at 90-nanometer, they're also pushing 65-nanometer. Exactly why would their mix be different because it seems like they also don't, similar to Logic in terms of the metal layers and things like that. Why is it really -- why has it been lagging now for a little while? Thanks a lot.
A - Rick Wallace: If by mix you mean why aren't they spending as a larger percent of the total?
Q - Ben Pang: Correct.
A - Rick Wallace: I don't know. I guess you'd have to ask them. They have been very careful in terms of their spending and very prudent. So I think that -- you listen to them now and their utilizations are running very high. Don't know why they are not spending more but I suspect, as we said, we are going to see that happening in 2006 probably not in Q1. Probably after that.
Q - Ben Pang: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shekhar Pramanick with Moors and Cabot.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: Afternoon, Rick, could you talk about the reticle inspection business. Is that following the same cycle as wafer fab investment cycle given the tools are really high priced and would you be having some more newer tools? Any color you could give there about how the orders might look there?
A - Rick Wallace: Yes, Reticle Inspection, I guess I say high value. We do have high value tools in reticle Inspection and we are both dealing with more and more challenging designs, the lithography designs are really pushing the reticle technologies and that's driving our reticle business. Also we are seeing reticle business in the fab lines. So we have that expansion as well. It looks good and we think that reticle is a solid business going forward and we'll benefit from this cycle as well.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: So is reticle inspection investment cycle is basically coinciding with WFE or is there some kind of a lag or any different pattern there or it's the same?
A - John Kispert: Hey, Shekhar, John Kispert, I think the interesting thing about the orders we have gotten over the last couple of quarters out of our reticle inspection business is they really are around -- more around 90-nanometer and 65-nanometer. Just a little bit in the 65-nanometer. It's still more capacity buying that's going on. And the bulk of 65-nanometer and 45-nanometer is still in front of us. And it's kind of -- to your point, I think your question is that you tend to see that start before you see the wafer, in our case the wafer inspection in metrology pick up after it, why? Because people are qualifying the reticles and preparing for a ramp. We haven't seen that really pick up yet at the 65 node.
Q - Shekhar Pramanick: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael O'Brien with Bear Stearns.
Q - Michael O’Brien: Hi, thanks. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about Japan, that has been relatively strong over the last year or so. Do you see the projects? Can you move forward there? And do you think your historical average goes up a bit as Japan tries to take a leadership position again?
A - Rick Wallace: Yes. We are modeling Japan that the March quarter somewhere around 20% and we finished at 21% last quarter and that is right at historical averages. It's lumpy. We do see projects moving forward there, we also have wafer manufacturing there and we've got reticle manufacturing there as well. But it is off of its historical number -- or not historical but the numbers we saw over the last several quarters. It's down some. But pretty solid. We think it will probably revert more to the norm of 20%.
Q - Michael O’Brien: So you think it stays in this as opposed to going back to the higher percentage than it was some of the quarters last year.
A - Rick Wallace: Correct.
Q - Michael O’Brien: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timm Schulze-Melander with Morgan Stanley.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Congratulations on the quarter. I just want to come back, I think to this foundry question here. LAM research clearly driving for very strong bookings from the foundries and you guys do have longer lead times than them. So it does seem a bit strange and maybe this is kind of a hangover from Semicon Japan. But could one logical explanation not be that either you are seeing market share erosion at that customer base or maybe there is a delay in order placement lost they're evaluating rival tools. How should we think about that? Thanks.
A - Rick Wallace: Yes, we model as we said at 25%. We don't see any evidence of share erosion. In fact quite the opposite. The last several weeks and few months we have seen continued success as I mentioned of our 2800 product in Puma gaining acceptance. So I don't think it's that. I think that our forecasting window is, as John said, there are large orders that can come in, in and out of the quarter. So in terms of specifics, we may also be doing better in other regions. I'm not really sure how to address it. It's not due to share loss. We will get the business when they spend the money.
A - John Kispert: Timm, John Kispert. I think if you looked at just the raw dollars, we give you the percentages and the totals and you just do the math you'll see that foundries have been increasing steadily for us for the last couple of quarters.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Maybe I did the math wrong. I just sort of did it back of an envelope, it looks like it's down about 4% sequentially at the midpoint of your guidance. Maybe I did the math wrong.
A - John Kispert: Yes. It's up. It's up, Timm. And I think if you just did the dollar values on that you'd see that it's rising quarter on quarter the last couple of quarters. And we bottomed out and it's more than double than it was two quarters ago.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: You said foundry was going to be what percentage of bookings in the March quarter?
A - Rick Wallace: About 25.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: And you said it was 30 in the prior quarter?
A - Rick Wallace: Correct.
A - John Kispert: But the guidance was also higher.
A - Rick Wallace: The guidance was higher. That's a flattish number.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: And when I do the math I get to about 147, plays about 154. Maybe we can follow-up offline.
A - John Kispert: My point is you just go back two quarters and you will see that it's up much higher over the last two quarters. That's all.
Q - Timm Schulze-Melander: Great.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Duley with Merriman.
Q - David Duley: Congratulations on nice numbers. I hate to beat the dead horse with the foundry, but I am just going to come back to an observation about the numbers. I think last quarter you mentioned that kind of the swing factor in your order rate, the 5% plus or minus 10% was the foundries and clearly foundry bookings did increase sequentially I think by my math about 51%. From 101 to 152 million. However, orders in Taiwan were down sequentially by 23%. So it is a little -- I guess we got the foundry bookings that we all thought, but I kind of thought the foundry bookings would be coming out of Taiwan. What is your observation as to when you think the Taiwanese bookings would start to increase, which I guess means we are trying to figure out when is TSMC going to place their orders with you and I think there's a general thought out there that they've started to pass out orders to other players and it seems unusual that you don't have them.
A - Jeff Hall: David, it's the reason we give a range in our guidance, too. We are fully engaged with them. I feel real good about how we are positioned. Clearly in the foundry numbers that you guys got this quarter and in Taiwan numbers you got this quarter is a bunch of business from the largest foundries in Taiwan. And I expect us over, as Rick said over the next six months or so for it to get larger. The prediction of that I guess we are probably a little bit more reluctant to say which quarter it is. If it's this quarter or the next.
Q - David Duley: Okay, fair enough. Just one final thing for me. Can you -- just observation on the U.S. bookings being down sequentially. I obviously think Intel increasing its CapEx substantially would we might see this number revert upward later on in the year? And then just remind us what were your peak order rates in 2000.
A - Jeff Hall: Sure, on U.S. we did see U.S. as down as a total percent last quarter. We were at 17% but we are forecasting strong U.S. business this quarter probably close to 35% of our overall business. In terms of peak, John, you got that?
A - John Kispert: High 600s. I think it probably got up to 700 in one quarter, but high 6s is what it was peaked. Just off the top of my head in history.
Q - David Duley: Thanks a let. Again, congratulations.
A - John Kispert: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Paleyo with Soleil.
Q - Steven Paleyo: Jeff, you have $11 a share in cash. Why not get more aggressive with the stock buyback. You guys' share count is essentially flat over the last few years when companies like Novellus have managed to get theirs down by about 15%. I would think this would be particularly important since you guys are relatively a little bit more heavy in the option expense and how it impacts KLAs P&L. I also have one more follow-up if I could.
A - Jeff Hall: Well, we were the first in the industry to have a dividend three quarters ago, $24 million a quarter of dividend. We have a systematic buyback plan. Since we implemented our systematic buyback plan we've bought back about 17 million shares at an average price of $38. Over the last two years fully diluted share count is flat. We are in the market every day buying back shares and we are going to keep doing that.
Q - Steven Paleyo: Well maybe these are actually then, interrelated. When I look at your gross margins including options I think your gross margins are around 55.5% or so of the quarter you just reported. If you are about to book roughly almost 600 million in orders, I assume that 600 becomes revenue at some point. At a 65% drop through, incremental drop through that would mean I think gross margins including options would go to about 57, 57.5%. A, does that sound right to you and I guess these two questions are really interrelated, but are there any other areas you guys can do to make up maybe another 200 plus bips of gross margins including options to actually hit a 60% including options?
A - Jeff Hall: I'm not going to question your math, Steve. If your math is correct, it's correct. It sounds all right to me. I think the question is what are we doing to focus on gross margin basically going forward to get some more--?
Q - Steven Paleyo: Well, I mean it's interrelated with the options as well. So I'm looking at it all in here and all in I think your gross margin 600 million are probably closer to around 57, 57.5 rather than the talk of our kind of 59, 60. I was just wondering is there any other cost control? Anything else you guys can do to actually do it even to approach a 60% gross margin like you were talking about before, even including option impacts.
A - Rick Wallace: I guess one thing I would said is we've had this option impact for as long as I have been in the Company. I mean we've had options so it's always been there. It's just now that we are using Black-Scholes to tell you what the number is. But having said that, as you know don't take our eye off the gross margin. I will take you through a couple of the programs that are in the Company today to drive -- continuously drive down our cost per unit. One, and probably the most important is our common platform. We've cut the number of platforms in the Company over the last five years by about 30 to 40%. And that, of course, is going to speed up the learning not only in manufacturing and in service but also with our customers. There is a quicker time to learn how to build and maintain our equipment over time. And you are going to have a more common supply chain with the obvious pricing leverages there and the quickness. The second thing is a cycle time reduction which I think everybody knows is a big part of the leverage in the equipment industry. Especially in times like this when things start to pick up. You can see very quick material changes in the cycle time not only of building and installing but maintaining the equipment across the Company. And we've really focused on that as far as our training is concerned. You can see that in the head count we -- less head count per revenue dollar and so you will see that continue over the next couple quarters and so we are comfortable. So that's just two things I picked, Steve. I can give you a couple more but we are real comfortable with the margin expansion moving forward and passing a lot of that value back on to our customers.
Q - Steven Paleyo: Great. Good quarter and congratulations to you on your new roles there. You guys sound like a solid team. Consistent message. Congrats.
A - Rick Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ray Kukragia with WR Hambrecht.
Q - Ray Kukragia: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. Again, congratulations on solid numbers. Could you share some thoughts on any strategy that you might have for the back end process control now that you are not foreseeing all this? And also if you could give us any update on the competitive landscape and the inspection area I believe one of your competitors has put out some eval tools which is getting pretty good reviews. Thank you.
A - Rick Wallace: Thank you for the call and the question. On your two questions. Back end, we've said all along that there are different ways to look at these markets and these are really make/buy choices and we evaluate the different points of entry. So I'm not going to tip my hand and say how we are going to do it but you can rest assured if there is an attractive market and one we think makes sense we will pursue it. In terms of bare wafer, we always have competition and really no change in that. Our market share in bare wafer continues to be strong and really we are driving adoption of our new technology and the SP 2, very strong both with the wafer manufacturers and semiconductor manufacturers. So we expect customers to look at alternatives but we continue as you know to work very hard to win their business and so no real change in our performance there.
Q - Ray Kukragia: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gary Shway with CIBC World Markets.
Q - Gary Shway: I've got kind of a simplistic question. Let me run it by you. If I look at your guidance for bookings of 600, that's roughly 10% below kind of your prior peak of 680. And if I look at my numbers for CapEx, CapEx in '06 is going to be roughly 5 to 10% below the peak in 2000. So when you guys look internally at your sizing activities, how do you justify kind of running at a 600 to kind of $700 million bookings run rate for the rest of this year? Do you kind of look at it from the standpoint of end customers like memory coming down but foundry and logic customers filling the gap in the second half? Or is there a more philosophical reason why you think you could run at this kind of level for a sustainable period of time?
A - John Kispert: Hey, Gary, John Kispert. The way we look at it is really we take a much simpler approach and we just talk to our customers and stay close to our customers. And add it all up and try to explain to you guys from what we see. And we've found through the years that that's the only way to do this. We could try to predict the second half and how high is high and how quick could we get to different highs. But instead what we try to focus on because we just -- through the years have realized that that's just not going to create any shareholder value. The way to do this is to stay close and to build a very flexible organization that can react quickly in either direction. So to say that we kind of model out over the next couple quarters as far as how high our orders could be, it's just not the way we look at things. We will take it a quarter at a time and build our capacity model around that. Did I answer your question?
Q - Gary Shway: Yes. And just from a philosophical standpoint do you think that one reason you could kind of run at sustainably higher levels is that, A, maybe there is a higher kind of inspection metrology intensity at 65, 45-nanometer or B, maybe you guys are rolling out so many more compelling products on a more regular basis that there is just inherently chip makers are less able to kind of reuse tools in inspection metrology from you compared to process equipment.
A - Rick Wallace: Gary, I think you hit the two key points. And the reason we bring out the new tools is because we have to bring out new capability to meet those demands at 65 and 45 and there is no question our customers are finding more and more challenges as they go to their advance design rules and asking us and working with us on providing those technologies. So part of our investment level, most of our investment level in R&D is to get those tools out and get those tools to market and as we said earlier you are going to start seeing those come out in the next couple of quarters as we roll out these new products.
Q - Gary Shway: Is there a way I can sneak in one more question?
A - Rick Wallace: A real quick one, Gary.
Q - Gary Shway: If you look at any bucket whether it is memory, foundry, logic, wafer inspection, reticle inspection, metrology or any region is there any top two buckets that you can think of right now that you could probably exceed the prior peak in terms of orders?
A - John Kispert: Gary, that's a hard one. I don't have that kind of data in front of me. I will tell you we have people running every one of those businesses and every one of those regions and that's certainly their quest. And again it's back to when our customers want it and then of course our goal is to make sure they adopt as much as possible.
Q - Gary Shway: Okay, awesome. Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stuart Muter with RBC Capital Markets.
Q - Stuart Muter: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Couple of quick questions. First, following up on the question about reticle inspection. Do you think it can be a strong bookings in March and then secondly how is the demand from the Japanese wafer manufacturers? Thanks.
A - Rick Wallace: Sure. Thanks for the question. Reticle inspection continues to do well and we expect the March quarter to be somewhere in the 15 to 20% of our overall business. Japan, as I said, we do see the wafer manufacturing supporting this 300-millimeter ramp and so we have got good business there. I think the one thing on wafer though, is the wafer capacity buys we probably had saw a stronger quarter in wafer capacity buys last quarter and so we do see that leveling off a little bit but we see some activity in the wafer fabs there as well.
Q - Stuart Muter: Great. Thank you.

Operator Instructions:
Q - Bill Ong: John, the reticle business, any of these applications addressing the flat panel display market and if not is there an opportunity there?
A - Rick Wallace: Hey, Bill, it's Rick. No, not really opportunities in flat panel. There may be opportunities but it's not where we are focused right now though. We are focused on semi and we have enough challenges to address there.
Q - Bill Ong: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Philip Lee with JP Morgan.
Q - Philip Lee: A couple questions on gross margins. Can you give us a little bit more color on why gross margins went down this quarter again? And then secondly, you said you said you will be ramping new products. Is this going to be a net positive because the design common platforms or is this going to be a net negative because you are going to be ramping up the manufacturing learning curve?
A - Jeff Hall: Let me start with the gross margin question. What happened in December is exactly what we would have expected to happen in December. It's the beginning of an up cycle. We have got a bunch of new product coming out. Shipments and revenue have been flat for the past three quarters. So as we started to significantly increase our production we saw about $1 million of ramp related costs start to hit. Things like overtime, NPI materials, early stage systems testing. That stuff starts to hit the cost line and we are still ramping and the revenue hasn't come through yet. So as the revenue starts coming through like John was saying and I was saying earlier, cycle times are going to drop dramatically. The costs are going to drop across our entire supply chain. The support costs per unit go down. And we are headed for 60 to 70% incremental gross margin going forward from here.
Q - Philip Lee: Would you say that the new products that you are introducing structurally have a higher margin than what they replaced?
A - John Kispert: Hey, Phil, it's John Kispert. Certainly they are designed and we pointed them at markets with that in mind. What is always difficult until you fully ramp the products is to see exactly what the unit cost is going to be over time. Right now I don't see any reason why they won't be, given the common platforms and some of the things we have talked about. But you can never be sure until you have been through the ramp with the next generation of platform, next generation of the product. Right now it looks pretty good to us.
Q - Philip Lee: Thanks, guys.
A - John Kispert: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: You actually have no further questions, sir.
John Kispert, President and Chief Operating Officer: Great, thank you very much for everybody participating on the conference call today. Our next conference call is currently scheduled for April 27, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes the KLA-Tencor Corporation Q2 2006 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.
