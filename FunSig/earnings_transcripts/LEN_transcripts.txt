Operator: Now I'd like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and Co-CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. I'm in Miami today together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; and Fred Rothman, our Chief Operating Officer. As usual, today I'm going to give a brief macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction costs, cycle time, some of our other operating positions. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight along with some limited guidance for the second quarter of 2025, and then of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period. And as usual, I'd like to ask you to please limit to one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many as possible. So let me begin. As we noted in our press release last night, we're very pleased to review our 2025 first quarter results against the backdrop of a challenging economic environment for the housing market. We adhere to our strategy and focus on driving consistent volume and growth by matching sales and production pace and using our margin as a circuit breaker. We completed our Millrose spin-off, distributing shares to our shareholders and supporting our transition to an asset light land light model and we completed our Rausch Coleman acquisition using our asset-light model as we expand into new markets. While margin and earnings have been adjusting to movements in the overall housing market, we are confident that our focus on volume and even flow will position us very well for resilience, durability, and growth in the future. Let me briefly discuss the overall housing market. Consistent with last quarter's earnings call, the macroeconomy remains challenging as mortgage interest rates have remained higher for longer, which has left the overall housing market weaker for longer. Across the housing landscape, actionable demand has slowed materially. On a bad news is good news basis, all of this has led to the long awaited environment where the costs of both homes, new and existing, and apartments start to come down. As we noted in our press release, our average sales price this quarter net of incentives declined to $408,000, 1% lower than last year. Evidence suggests that the time is now and the sticky and large housing component of inflation might soon contribute to curtail the last mile to the 2% target. While underlying demand for homes remains strong, actionable demand is limited by affordability and credit, which remain challenged by limited funds for down payments, as well as income qualification for a mortgage. Most recently, even where household income indicates an approvable mortgage qualification, elevated personal debt levels have often presented as an additional impediment to already strained mortgage access. Additionally, until recently, consumers have been generally confident that they will remain employed and that their compensation is safe. But more recently, even that safety has been called into question. A somewhat confused consumer and wavering consumer confidence have challenged the consumer's desire and ability to transact. While there continues to be considerable traffic customers looking for homes, the urgency to actually transact remains tepid. The overall supply of homes has also remained constrained by years of underproduction. Additional shortfalls in production will likely be triggered by now muted demand together with already existing restrictive land permitting and higher impact fees at local levels and higher construction costs across the housing landscape. Additionally, new approaches to both immigration and tariffs have potential limiting impacts and Jon will discuss this further in just a few minutes. In summary, the housing market has softened as affordability and consumer confidence have limited actionable demand. Incentives have been increasing and net housing prices seem to be moderating. At very least, housing will not be contributing to inflationary pressures and while demand is constrained, supply is equally limited. Against this backdrop, let me turn to Lennar's operating strategy. Our strategy is and has remained very clear. That is, simplify our business by focusing on the two core tenets of our operating strategy. Operationally, build and deliver consistent volume to maximize efficiencies and financially drive asset-light land-light focus to build cash flow. Now that we have completed our Millrose spin-off, we have intensified our focus on each. First, we focus on consistent volume by matching our production pace with our sales pace. This means that as market conditions change to the positive or to the negative, we focus on driving and delivering consistent volume at the division level and at the community level in order to maximize efficiencies in construction costs, in-cycle time, in SG&A, and in all elements of marketing and sales. We also strive to deliver consistent and even slow volume to our trade partners so they can be more efficient and deliver cost savings to us. While we are not there yet, we are getting better each quarter and will accelerate progress now that the spin is behind us. Our execution in the first quarter was materially better than in the fourth quarter last year when we missed our expectation on sales volume. This quarter, we did adjust and adapt to market conditions in real-time as we adjusted incentives and pricing, we achieved expected sales volumes and we did not enable our inventory levels to spike. We are laser focused on keeping sales volume up in order to catch up pace and find even flow in each division and each community. By maintaining this discipline, we will not build up inventory in either built homes or in developed home sites and we will efficiently convert production to cash. As I noted last quarter, the catching up comes at a cost and that cost us additional pressure on margin. Accordingly, we have looked ahead to the second quarter of 2025, as we look ahead to the second quarter of 2025, we expect to sell between 22,500 and 23,500 homes and deliver between 19,500 and 20,500 homes. We expect our margin to be approximately 18% depending on market conditions, as we expect to continue to see margin pressure on deliveries that will be sold during the quarter. Nevertheless, we are focused on driving sales and closings and driving strong current cash flow even at reduced profitability, while maintaining properly sized inventory levels so that as market conditions stabilize or improve, we will benefit from normalized margins across our growing volume. On a side note, our margins are actually quite strong, except for the approximately 13% incentive, we are using to enable affordability. These are outsized for the moment and normalized incentives should be around 5% to 6% and that would track to a normalized margin -- for our normalized margin to be in the mid-20%’s margin. We remain focused on consistent volume in current market conditions and we will be very well-positioned as the market normalizes. The second focus of our operating strategy is to refine our asset-light configuration. We are much closer to the completion of the strategic rework of our operating platform from being a traditional homebuilder with sizable land assets to becoming a pure play land-light asset-light manufacturing model homebuilder that benefits from just-in-time delivered -- just-in-time finished home site delivery. The Millrose spin completed the backbone structure of that rework. Now we are and have the time to focus on the refinement of that platform. With Millrose operational, we now have a strong complement of land bank partners that enable the land and land development activity that enables the just-in-time delivery of fully developed homesite stocks as a manufacturer. Of course, each of these valued partners operates a little differently and has a different cost structure. But with the diverse land trade partners, we will refine cost and execution over time. As with all of our trade partners, our land partners will benefit from our consistent and predictable volume and our cost structure will benefit as a direct result. As we've noted before, once refined, we have conviction that our structured asset-light land-light model enables far more predictable volume and growth with a much lower asset base and lower risk profile. We are confident that our operating strategies of consistent volume and an asset-light land-light just-in-time delivery system of developed home sites will continue to enable our company to be best positioned to rationalize our cost structure and be best positioned with strong volume as margins normalize. Let me turn back briefly to our first quarter 2025 results. As I noted earlier, we are quite pleased with the successes embedded in our first quarter results and accomplishments. In our first quarter, we started 17,651 homes, delivered 17,834 homes, and sold 18,355 homes. As mortgage interest rates remained higher for longer and consumer confidence searched for footing, we drove volume with starts, while we incentivized sales to enable affordability. As a result, during the first quarter, sales incentives rose to approximately 13%, reducing our gross margin to 18.7%. Our SG&A came in at 8.5%, which produced a net margin of 10.2%, although, we were able to maintain construction costs and reduce cycle time, as Jon will detail shortly. We exceeded our sales and delivery expectations, while we were able to grow our community count from 1,447 last quarter to 1,584 communities this quarter, including our Rausch Coleman acquisition, and we're better prepared -- and we are now better prepared for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect to deliver between 86,000 and 88,000 homes in 2025. Our results represent a consistent and strategic quarter of operating results in the context of a very difficult economic environment, all while completing a time intensive Millrose spin and growing into new markets with the Rausch Coleman acquisition. We clearly were able to walk into them at the same time. Additionally, on the positive side, we have driven our operating strategy to enable consistent cash flow, which has enabled us to strategically allocate capital. Our strategy has enabled us to repurchase another 5.2 million shares of stock for $703 million in the first quarter, while we continue to deliver a strong dividend. Additionally, we distributed as a dividend to Lennar shareholders, 80% of the shares of Millrose Property Corporation, and through that Millrose ownership, they will receive a regular dividend while providing the permanent capital, which will drive the future success of Lennar. As for the remaining 20% of the Millrose shares, Lennar will shortly dispose of that remaining 20% in either a further distribution of Millrose shares or at Lennar's option may execute a potential exchange for Lennar shares, which would basically effectuate a cashless buyback of Lennar shares. Just to say this again, the additional 20% interest will be retained for a relatively brief period of time and will either be distributed or exchange for Lennar shares to effectuate a cashless stock buyback. After our stock repurchases and dividends, we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of cash on book and an 8.9% debt to total capital ratio. We are well positioned after the Millrose spin to be able to continue to return capital to shareholders as we continue to grow our business. We are very well positioned from balance sheet to operating strategy to be able to adjust and address as the market unfolds as we execute through the year. So let me conclude and say that while this has been a constructive quarter for Lennar and while the short-term road ahead might still seem a little choppy, we're very optimistic about the longer term road ahead. This has been a very exciting quarter for Lennar, and we couldn't be prouder of the work and dedication of our extraordinary associates who've worked together to make it all happen. Let me also take a minute to welcome to the team, the talented new members of Lennar, who have joined from our Rausch Coleman combination. We couldn't be prouder to now have us all working together as one. Together, we've expanded our platform as we have upgraded the financial and operating platforms of Lennar, and as we will continue to drive production and sales. We've continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across the market. And as and when interest rates normalize, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated and our margin will quickly recover. As a company, we are well-prepared with a strong and growing national footprint, growing community count, and growing volume. Perhaps most importantly, our strong balance sheet and even stronger land banking relations afford us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful growth for our future. In that regard, we will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to use our land partnerships to grow with a focus on high returns on capital, and on equity. We will also continue to focus our pure-play business model and reduce exposure to non-core assets. We will continue to drive to just-in-time homesite delivery and an asset-light balance sheet. And as we complete our asset-light transformation, we will continue to refine our platform and generate strong cash flow, and return new capital to shareholders through dividend and stock buyback, while we also pursue strategic growth. With that, let me turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Stuart has highlighted for you our strategy of being a consistent high volume homebuilding manufacturer. I'll further review this as I discuss our performance on sales pace, cost reduction, cycle time reduction, along with the execution of our asset-light land strategy for the first quarter. As noted, our overall first quarter sales pace of 4.1 homes per community per month was right in line with our start case of 4.0. This was accomplished with consistent starts and accurate cycle times, which determine the sales pace needed at each community. Knowing the output of this production, our marketing and sales teams engaged with our machine to turn digital leads into appointments and then convert appointments into sales. Throughout each week, we evaluate leads, appointments, and sales activity to measure if we are on track to achieve the needed pace. We continuously adjust to ensure we end the week not only with a targeted number of sales but with the sales of the right homes. If the community falls short on pace in any given week, there is clear focus on taking action to course correct and get back on pace. To drive the needed level of quality appointments, we focus on improving the experience for our customers to achieve higher conversion rates versus the alternative of chasing more top of funnel leads, which increases marketing spend. We believe our approach produces more qualified and motivated customer appointments, which we can convert into sales at higher conversion rates. During the quarter, as we move past the beginning of February, we do not see the seasonal pickup typically associated with the beginning of the spring selling season. So we continue to lean into our machine focusing on converting leads and appointments and adjusting incentives as needed to maintain sales pace. These adjustments came in the form of mortgage rate buydowns, price reductions, and closing cost assistance. In general, homebuyers in Florida and Texas are two highest volume states needed more help than most other markets around the country. We needed more incentives in Florida and Texas markets to assist buyers achieve mortgage payments they can afford as well as to offset both a slowing in migration environment and increased inventory. All markets around the country require incentives to assist buyers in the current home buying environment. In this challenged macroenvironment, we utilized on our machine along with our dynamic pricing model to identify unsold homes nearing completion. Appointments are set for those homes and prices are established to achieve sales preventing the buildup of inventory. Accordingly, we entered the -- we ended the quarter with an average of about two unsold completed homes per community. Our production team continued its strive of being an ever more highly efficient homebuilder. The disciplines of planning for and delivering consistent construction starts, designing efficient to build floor plans, deploying digitally enabled scheduling and quality control processes and a well-trained construction management team all allow for the development of meaningful strategic partnerships with our entire supply chain. The continuous improvement of these strategic relationships with our trade partners is the core of how we drive down both construction cost and cycle time quarter-after-quarter. In the first quarter, our construction costs were lower by 1% from Q4 and decreased on a year-over-year basis by 2.5% to our lowest direct construction costs since Q3 of 2021. We expect this trend to continue for our second quarter and into the year. Also in our first quarter, cycle time decreased on average by one day sequentially from Q4 down to 137 calendar days on average for single family detached homes. This is a 17 day or 11% decrease year-over-year, we also expect continued improvement in cycle time reduction for our second quarter. As Stuart discussed, the execution of our strategy of matching our sales pace to our production pace required sales incentives of 13% in the quarter, about 700 basis points above normal. Our trade partners know that we are doing this to maintain production levels, which they greatly benefit from. Our trade partners work with us to reduce their operating costs and when needed to lower their margins. This is critical to our execution of reducing construction costs in each quarter. Let me address tariffs. We've been in discussions regarding the potential impacts of tariffs with our supply chain. These discussions all start with a review of margin reductions Lennar has already taken. This leads to a constructive effort to identify alternative sourcing and material strategies. Additionally, we prepare our trade partners to absorb potential increases to their supply chain costs in the event of tariffs. To date, we have no impact -- sorry, to date, we have had no impact to our cost from tariffs and we will work closely with all our trade partners that further tariffs present themselves to mitigate offset cost impacts. Similarly, with respect to potential labor disruptions that could derive from immigration policy enforcement, our consistent high volume makes our construction a priority for our trade partners. To date, there has been no shortage of labor or impact to cycle time. Again, our strategic trade partners appreciate the financial impact to our margins of maintaining our consistent high volume and we expect to be as well-positioned as possible should any disruptions present themselves. As Stuart addressed and as Diane will provide further details, we have further executed on our asset-light strategy for the Millrose spin. Post-Millrose, we ended the quarter with our supply of owned home sites improving to 0.2 years, down from 1.3 years, and controlled home site percentage increasing to 98% from 77% a year ago. During the quarter, Land banks acquired on our behalf about 29,000 home sites for about $1.8 billion and a commitment of about $1.1 billion in land development. We purchased during the quarter from our various land banks, land banks partners almost 15,000 home sites for about $1.6 billion. Operationally, our production first discipline of even flow starts allows for the planning and consistency of takedowns from land banks, providing for efficiencies in the operations of land management by both our land bank partners and ourselves. As we move forward, we are focusing on refining the efficiencies in and around the coordination of just-in-time land acquisitions by our land partners and us with the commencement of land development and/or home construction. These improvements in the execution of all of our operating strategies enable capital and production efficiencies, leading to an improving inventory churn, which now stands at 1.7% versus 1.5% last year, a 13% increase. In our second quarter, we will continue to refine the execution of one of our marketing and sales machine, our even flow, high volume production, and all land acquisition and development activities to be even more operationally and capital-efficient. I also want to extend a welcome to our Rausch Coleman associate to Lennar family and thank all of our Lennar associates for their hard work, focus, and dedication. And now, I'll turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our operating performance. So, therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes summarizing balance sheet highlights and then provide estimates for the second quarter. So starting with the balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were highly focused on turning our inventory and generating cash by pricing homes to market conditions. The result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $3 billion revolving credit facility. This provided total liquidity of approximately $5.3 billion. As noted, during our first quarter, we completed the distribution of shares of Millrose properties to our shareholders. As a result, we spun-off from our balance sheet $5.6 billion of land representing 87,000 home sites and $1 billion of cash. With this strategic transaction, we completed the next milestone in our journey of becoming a land-light just-in-time manufacturer of homes and established a provider of recyclable cash for the future. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of Rausch Coleman Homes, which extended our footprint into both new and existing markets. As a result of the Millrose and Rausch transaction, we ended the quarter owning 13,000 home sites and controlling 533,000 home sites for a total of 546,000 home sites. As Jon noted, this translated into our year's own supply improving to 0.2 years and our home sites controlled increasing to 98%, our lowest years owned and highest control percentage in our history. We believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share and scale in a capital efficient way. As we look at ratios, our inventory turn was 1.7 times and our return on inventory was almost 30%. During the quarter, we started approximately 17,700 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 38,300 homes in inventory. This inventory number includes approximately 3,100 homes that were completed unsold, which is about two homes per community, well within our target historical range. Turning to our debt position. We had no redemptions or repurchases of senior notes this quarter. Our net debt maturity of $500 million is not until May 2025. Our homebuilding debt to total capital was 8.9%, including the impact of the Millrose spin-off. Consistent with our commitment to increasing total shareholder returns, we repurchased 5.2 million of our outstanding shares for $703 million and we paid dividends totaling $132 million. This was, of course in a distribution to the Millrose shares. Our stockholders' equity was just under $23 billion and our book value per share was about $86. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we progress through 2025. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q2 and provide some guidance estimates. Starting with new orders. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 22,500 to 23,500 homes as we match sales and production paces. We anticipate our Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 19,500 to 20,500 homes with a continued focus on turning inventory into cash. Our Q2 average sales price on those deliveries should be about $390,000 to $400,000 as we continue to price to market to meet affordability. We expect our gross margins to be approximately 18%, which excludes purchase accounting depending on market conditions. Margin is impacted by our use of incentives as a bridge to customers and affordably priced homes. Our SG&A percentage should be in the range of 8% to 8.2% to maintain sales activity. For the combined homebuilding, joint venture land sales, and other categories, we expect a loss of about $15 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. For our multifamily segment, we expect to be about breakeven for the quarter. Then turning to Lennar others, we expect a loss of between $25 million to $30 million, excluding the impact of any potential mark-to-market adjustments for our public technology investments. Our Q2 corporate G&A should be about 2% of total revenue and our foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our Q2 tax rate to be approximately 25.3% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 261 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $1.80 to $2 per share for the quarter. With that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. We ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up until all the questions have been answered. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate all the colors. And I guess my first question relates to the long-term, whatever the normalized margin that you referred to. I think you -- Stuart, you're referring to the gross margin of kind of the mid-20s. And I was wondering, if you could give us a sense for what the operating margin might be after corporate expense? I assume corporate expense you're thinking maybe longer-term like 1.5% or something like that. But be helpful to understand what you think the normalized operating margin would be? And what do you think the path looks like to get your SG&A and corporate combined down from its current elevated level?
Stuart Miller: I think that across the board, Steve, that you're really looking at efficiencies that are being brought to all elements of the business, especially in the wake of having spun Millrose and some of the activity that just had to take place as we went through what was a time-intensive program. I think that all parts of our business are being relooked at and rerationalized. The simple math that I did was basically around the abnormally high level of incentives that are out there in the market right now to get to the volumes that enable us to realize on the efficiencies that we think will ultimately get. So I haven't figured out what I think that normalized bottom line operating margin is going to be, but it's significantly higher than where we are right now where we're basically having to incentivize affordability at a very elevated level.
Stephen Kim: Okay. But, it's fair to say though that you don't think that a 10% to 11% combined SG&A and corporate rate is sort of the normalized level going forward, right?
Stuart Miller: Yeah. We do not. We actually think that as we get more and more focused on the new version of the way that we're configured, every part of our business will come under an efficiency focus. And it starts with elements of the land side of our business, the land acquisition side of our business, the operating side that we've talked about, the corporate side, everything becomes simpler as we move forward. It's just going to take some time to embed that.
Diane Bessette: Yes, Stephen. I guess I would just say, if you go back to kind of like 2023, no, our SG&A was probably around 7% versus 8% now. So I think that gives you a little bit of a framework. And our corporate G&A was about 1.5 versus 2. The only thing I'd say there is that we do continue to invest in technology. We see that being a very important component. So that one is a little tougher to call, but I agree with Stuart. I think that we're in a more elevated mode now than we will be in the future.
Stephen Kim: Yeah. No, it's encouraging. I guess my second question is a broader one and it relates to how you've determined what the sales pace is that you wanted to build -- you want to build your platform to deliver? Obviously, demand has been running below that pace, hence, the incentives and all. But you've expressed the view that demand is ultimately going to normalize higher and that your margins will normalize once that happens. But an alternative view might be that this is the normal level of demand. And it's been kind of a while now that the demand has been a little disappointing. And so I'm curious as how long is Lennar going to tolerate subpar margins before you begin to question if maybe the machines built to -- maybe it ought to be built to a lower level of volume than what you chose to build it, let's say, a year or two ago?
Stuart Miller: Well, interesting question. I think that we clearly live in a dynamic world in the housing world. The question of what normalized demand is something that we're going to reassess as we move forward. As we're looking at things right now, it's really very much at the community level. And for the communities that we have, we think we're looking or we know we're looking at an absorption rate that we think over time is a normalized absorption rate. Will that change? We'll have to wait and see. But if we think through the math of where the housing market is, we keep going back to the fact that we've been underproducing any notion of normalized production for the past 10 to 15 years. And so we think that the underlying demand relative to the population and relative to where production has been leaves us in a supply shortage. And so it's our belief that right now with interest rates where they are, with affordability and inflation having infected -- affected affordability, we think that the market is undersupplied and that the demand levels and the embedded demand levels are much higher than what is actionable right now. And so that's what we're solving to. Might we change our mind as we go forward as the market evolves and as immigration questions come up and other questions come up, we'll have to wait and see.
Jon Jaffe: I would just add to Stuart's comment that as each new normal presents itself in the future, our machines is very clear and we have the ability to focus on adjusting it rather quickly throughout the platform.
Stephen Kim: Okay. So you actually -- if you do change your mind, it's something you're saying you could do relatively quickly, Jon, okay. So that's encouraging. Would you put that in like within a few quarters that you could adjust or is it something that you could do even quicker than that to clarify?
Jon Jaffe: Yeah. I think how quickly will move will depend upon what's happening relative to a new normal and how severe it might be. In most cycles, it's a much more gradual process and the adjustment is over several quarters. If we find ourselves in a place where we need to move faster, I feel comfortable we can do so.
Stuart Miller: I think the bottom line answer to the question is, we can adjust our production levels and therefore our sales pace pretty quickly. That would probably take a quarter or two. So we can make those adjustments pretty nimbly. And I think that we're getting better and better at being able to tweak up or tweak down.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Great. Thank you very much, guys.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details so far and congrats on all the exciting moves during the quarter. I know it was a busy time for you guys. So nice job getting all of it to the finish line. So, Stuart, I think you walked through the normalized margin conversation well. I'd like to drill on a little bit more there. So obviously, if incentives go back to normal tomorrow, yeah, your margins are going back to the mid-20s. But I think one of the advantages of your strategy and your model today is you are turning through your inventory a lot quicker than other builders and a lot of that inventory was underwritten in a different environment when incentives were much lower. So I guess my question is, you guys are out there buying land every day, you're buying a lot of land or tying up a lot of land. The land you're tying up today, is it being underwritten to an incentive level closer to today's level? And if so, can you get back to a gross margin north of 20% even if incentives don't necessarily get back down to that 5%, 6% level over the next few years or is it really going to require that type of return to normal to get that margin lift back up?
Stuart Miller: Alan, we probably haven't told that part of the story well enough yet. The way we've looked at our land reconfiguration is we're focused on turning that land inventory for exactly that reason. As we run through production levels where they are, we are basically selling the land that was underwritten at a different level and we are redeploying at current levels. So in just a second, I'm going to ask Fred to weigh in on this because Fred is kind of front and center in a lot of it. But the whole focus is let's run through the land and the inventory that was bought yesterday and constantly -- it is a constantly refreshing group of assets, both the home inventory and the land inventory, and particularly in a difficult market as we're in, yesterday's land acquisition isn't going to get better with time. So let's replace it with the next one. Fred, why don't you weigh in?
Fred Rothman: Sure. So we're very strategic right now in how we're approaching land acquisition. We're being patient, but we're also underwriting the current information and incentives and gearing to higher margins. But we're going to watch to see. Land tends to be trailing some of the other aspects of our business in moving down. And we're now finally starting to see land sellers, site development contractors realize what's happening in the market and we're going to take advantage of that over time.
Alan Ratner: Got it. Okay. That's encouraging to hear because it's obviously a big part of the strategy to be able to constantly refresh that cost basis. So I appreciate the thoughts there. Second question also on margin, but more near-term. I know you're not guiding for the remainder of the year, but if you -- it looks like your closing guidance, which you're maintaining implies a pretty solid ramp in revenue in the back half of the year. Typically, there is decent seasonality in your gross margin. You have about 150 basis points lift in margins over time in the back half of the year just on higher revenue number. Recognizing all the moving pieces here, you've got purchase account and you've got Millrose, the cost -- the higher costs flowing through there, although that's probably more a '26 and beyond story. You've got the Rausch Coleman just mix issue. Should we expect all else equal a similar seasonal trend in your margin this year or are those headwinds going to offset the typical seasonality?
Stuart Miller: Well, that is definitely a backdoor to asking for some guidance on how margins. And we're decidedly staying away from that. And I think that the market is still defining itself as we look ahead. There are all kinds of movements in the market that are political and social and economic. I think that we're going to just lead things where they are, we're going to wait and see how the market evolves. I think that going back to your first question though, Alan, is this is a time where turning assets to cash and then redeploying with a new view of market conditions is a real strategic advantage. It's what we're doing every day. Right now, we're going through our ops reviews, we've been in a number of our divisions, we're midway through and the focus is on exactly that spinning of land, continuing to keep the sales base up and we might take a lower margin, but we're generating cash and we're redeploying at a new understanding of where the market is and potentially where it's going. I think it's going to work to our benefit.
Alan Ratner: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of John Lovallo from UBS. Please go ahead.
John Lovallo: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. Maybe just to parse out the second quarter gross margin or the walk from the 18.7% to the 18%. It sounds like that's excluding the purchase accounting. So Diane, I guess I'm curious what is the expected purchase accounting agreement? And then maybe to Alan's question, I mean, Millrose, the impact from that seems like it might be more longer-dated, but there's probably some impact maybe 10 bps to 30 bps from that. And then along the same lines, are you guys currently selling homes at sub-18% margins right now?
Diane Bessette: Sounds on the purchase accounting, yeah, it was about 10 basis points in Q1, and I think it will probably be in the range of about 20 basis points in Q2 as we have a full quarter of activity from Rausch.
John Lovallo: Now the second part of the question?
Diane Bessette: Sorry, John, what was that? Again, what are we selling at?
John Lovallo: The second part was Millrose and sorry, then what are you currently selling at now? Yeah.
Diane Bessette: Yeah. I mean, what we're selling, we're -- the margin that guidance that we gave for Q2 was in part because there will be a lot of sell-and-close activity and we're probably in that zone with our current sales and closings in the current quarter.
John Lovallo: Okay. Understood. And then curious to get just how you guys would respond to sort of the bear argument that we hear quite often. Look, I mean, I personally understand the benefits of the even flow strategy over time. But I think there is a perception out there that you've sort of increased the cyclicality in the results, most prominently the margin, and that there's been -- this is sort of a divergence in the discipline that the industry has worked so hard to get credit for over the past decade. How do you guys kind of respond to that?
Stuart Miller: I'm not sure that I'm fully following the question, but look, we've been through these times before and if we have a -- if we're building homes and as we're building homes, we're quite sure that whether it's the land underneath it or whether it's the home itself in a market that is defining itself to the negative side, the home doesn't get more valuable, nor does the land get more valuable with time. We've kept our land assets far more short-term and therefore to be able to move through the land assets and ultimately to develop the built homes on. Tomorrow's pricing is not likely to be a lot better than today's. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's certainly how we've been executing. If we need to tap back on production, that's a decision we'll make as market conditions present themselves.
John Lovallo: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the details always.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, Mike.
Mike Rehaut: First, I wanted to zero in a little bit on some of the mechanics and how to think about the interactivity with Millrose going forward from two aspects. One, obviously, you've already had a significant portion of your land under option to begin with, but now you're taking it up by about another 20 points or so. So just wondering relative to perhaps, let's say, fiscal '24, what the full or annualized gross margin impact might be from pushing that additional 20% of your land base through options where theoretically it might be a little bit of a lower gross margin, all else equal. And secondly, on the Millrose side, with the tougher sales backdrop, I was wondering if there's any element of walking away from some options that I'm sure with the 18% average, there's something at one of the tail ends of that curve and if there would be any kind of option walkaways or things that we should anticipate over the next couple of quarters?
Stuart Miller: So relative to the margin and the impact of Millrose and to the land banking approach, the migration that we've made to an asset-light program. We've generally seen over time where it's a little bit -- a little less mixed in with some of the other movements of market conditions that the impact is generally about 100 basis points. That's what we've kind of calculated as we've gone through the migration over the past years. Of course, if we look at the current situation, it's a little bit more difficult to kind of share it out exactly what the impact is. But it does represent about 20% of our business. So you can kind of extrapolate from there in what is kind of a messy calculation right now. In terms of deposit walkaways, we're not thinking about very many, if any, deposit walkaways. The cost of walking away is probably higher than just working through the assets at a lower margin. We've been inclined to work through assets at lower margins. And so we're not injecting any deposit walkaways in our numbers. We actually think as we've looked back at current -- at past downturns, including the Great Recession that the best execution with shorter-term fully developed positions is almost invariably to work through the assets and turn the land asset to cash and redeploy the cash rather than a position of walking through, taking a hit relative to deposit money and ending up not covering your overhead and moving forward. So we think that the way we've configured our program actually incentivizes us and others for that matter to do the better economic, execute the better economic solution, take a lower margin, work through the asset, redeploy the cash.
Mike Rehaut: Great. No. Thank you for that, Stuart. Secondly, I'd love to just shift a second to the balance sheet and cash flows. And now with obviously the Millrose transaction, still pretty close in the rearview mirror, but nonetheless. If you have any updated thoughts around cap -- leverage, free cash flow and I believe earlier there had been talk perhaps of trying to use just net income being more or less equivalent to free cash flow and presumably a significant, if not, large portion of that would be towards share repurchase. So any updated thoughts around there and maybe even what any guardrails around share repurchase for 2025?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, we've daylighted this repeatedly on prior earnings calls where we've expressed -- explained that the cash flow reconciliation over the next year or so is going to be a complicated business. There are a lot of inflows and outflows. Millrose was anomalous in that we were actually spinning a large number of assets that ultimately would kind of flip back around into a cash flow negative kind of configuration as we're taking assets off book and then bringing them back on book over time. That rotation, we're going to have to let that work through a little bit. But we do have as kind of a North Star and where we're headed, a distinct focus on the fact that as this cash flow anomaly kind of works its way through, we think that we will be generating cash approximately equal to earnings and we do expect to reignite a stock buyback -- a cash stock buyback program that will be rather robust as that cycling kind of works its way through over the next year. Diane?
Diane Bessette: Yeah. As I said, Mike, I agree with that. The way I think about it is 2025 is a little bit of a year in transition. There's a lot that changed with Millrose and just the whole reconfiguration of our balance sheet. But I think as you know, we're always long term focused and we strongly believe that the asset-light capital-light model that we've developed is going to be really advantageous in the future and we'll meet all of the goals that we've established which is generate cash and really make sure that we're increasing total shareholder returns.
Mike Rehaut: Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, Susan.
Susan Maklari: Good morning. My first question is just sticking with thoughts on the cash generation of the business. One of the things that you mentioned is that now that the spin is done, you can accelerate the progress in terms of the even flow production side and standardizing your product and those efforts in there. Can you talk about where you are within that and how we should think about the progress that can come through over the next couple of quarters and what that will mean your ability to sustain cash generation even in a more volatile or weaker demand environment?
Stuart Miller: So I would say that we're at pretty early stage in terms of some of the cost rationalization and efficiencies that we know are going to come from the way that we're configured. These last few quarters have really been juggling a number of items to get to the completion of the Millrose spin and the combination with Rausch, which I'd say parenthetically is just it's working out to be exactly as expected. And I think that the asset-light approach has worked out very well also. But the more we're now able to focus on a simplified business model and we're seeing this in our current ops meetings. The ability to focus attention on the component parts that make this a simpler model I think going to generate a lot of benefits as we go forward. As it relates to cash generation, I think that the relationships that we now have established and that we are continuing to create on the land side of the business where we have a very carefully crafted dance. It's a lot like appliances or other materials that we put into the home. We have a just-in-time delivery system that's getting more and more efficient and effective. And I think that not only will that kind of rotation or dance of buying land, developing land, providing just-in-time delivered home sites on time as expected, it will look a lot like -- a lot more like the production cycle that we see in the building of a home. And I think the efficiencies embedded in that will be strong. And the cash flow that will be defined by a pure production machine will be very realistic because we've developed and spent the time to make sure that those land programs are durable, they're systemic and just like other materials that are delivered for the building of a home, we're able to rationalize the cost and the delivery system.
Jon Jaffe: I would just add, Susan. We're really enthusiastic, as said, of really turning land into more of a production commodity, it's going to allow us, we think to achieve the kind of efficiencies that we've achieved on the production vertical side of our business with land and land development. And we think that there is a world of opportunity there to become more efficient, which will translate into our cash flow and into our bottom line.
Stuart Miller: Yeah. But just on the land side, we're being pretty religious right now about making sure that we're not pulling land back on our books. We're not accumulating developed home sites as additional inventory. And those efficiencies are going to define your question on cash flow. How do we get cash flow to equal actual earnings? We think that's going to be exactly where we end up.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful color. And then thinking about the forward growth of the business, post the spin, does that change how you consider acquisitions? And can you talk about the kinds of deals that you might be interested and what you're seeing in terms of the M&A pipeline and perhaps the health of small -- some of these smaller private builders given what's going on in the market?
Stuart Miller: We've had -- over the past years, we've actually had a component of our growth that has been defined by combinations with smaller builders, either fortifying positions in our communities that we're already operating in and less so relative to growth into new markets. I think that the Rausch Coleman transaction is a more sizable transaction with a strategic operating team that is able to and I think is looking forward to working within one of our systems. I think the coordination that happens there is facilitated by our land programming that I think is going to work very well with the Rausch Coleman program and that does define the opportunity to think a little bit differently about how we grow. The more standard kind of M&A deals that we've done in the past have been more along the lines of finding land assets and new community count. I think that we'll be able to enter actually new markets in a more strategic way and using an asset-light approach really facilitates the ability to do it in a capital efficient way. Fred, would you add to that?
Fred Rothman: Yeah. I think the use of Millrose in the Rausch Coleman acquisition was a prime example of where M&A could become available, but we're very selective and we're out there looking, but we're going to be very strategic in this as well and continue to use our Millrose and potentially others to be the source of the capital for the land and us find the operational side. So it's a nice fit, but we're continuing to look at other opportunities.
Susan Maklari: Okay. Thank you all for the color. Good luck with everything.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you, Susan. And why don't we take one more question?
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Ken Zener: Good afternoon, all.
Stuart Miller: Hi, Ken.
Ken Zener: If you guys could -- hello, if you could expand -- I think this -- I know you guys are saying it again and again, but it's being missed by investors. Could you expand on your decision to start a home on an incremental cash-flow basis where land is increasingly, if not, a variable cost, and what you think that means for your cash flow per unit? Because I think that's what is the disconnect between where your model is going and the kind of the focus on a more margin centric response because that's how the industry traditionally looks at it?
Stuart Miller: Diane?
Diane Bessette: Yeah. I guess, can I just be repeating what we've said? I mean, I think that we think there's a lot of efficiencies by maintaining the production that offset that you might be thinking about. I think as you listen to Jon, for example, talk about the cost reductions in an inflationary environment. I think those cost reductions that we've seen on the direct construction side are pretty incredible and the ability to have third-party capital available for the land component is pretty important as well as covering overhead and those type of things. So you're right, land is definitely increasing. But in our view, when you look at it from a much higher lens, the efficiency is really supersede that.
Stuart Miller: I'm not sure what we…
Ken Zener: I guess, I just -- I want to clarify.
Stuart Miller: Are you asking about the decision to build each home?
Ken Zener: Yes, because what people think if you have a 10 -- let's call it, a 10% EBIT margin, right, people think could that be a 10% cash flow? No, it's not because traditional model, each unit you sell, you need to go out and right, acquire a raw lot that you need to develop where that's turned into a variable cost, i.e., cash flow, is your earnings? I think people are still kind of missing that because it seems to me that's how you're making your choice as opposed absent the need to buy land, which outside the margin side is your cash flow drag historically?
Stuart Miller: Well, listen, it -- I don't think it's quite that linear. The fact is that we're going out and we're looking for a piece of land. And the reality is that land might have to be developed and it might take a year, year-and-a-half for the land to actually mature to a developed home site. And while it isn't situated on our books, we have been a participant in making the decision on that piece of land, which we basically assign an absorption rate too. It might be three homes per month, four homes per month, but we are making that decision. The real benefit of where we are is that we're constantly refreshing. We're keeping those land obligations much shorter. And as they mature to develop home sites, we're taking them down. We're committing to a -- an absorption rate and that commitment is limited in its scope or in its risk by the amount of deposit and commitment that we have, but we are looking at building a model that says where we make a commitment to a takedown schedule, we're going to do our very best to execute on that in order to work-through that land. And that's how the land bank becomes a lot more efficient over time. The dependability on that absorption rate will enable them to bring the cost of capital down and re-rationalize the actual cost of our inputs relative to the home. So I wouldn't think of it as a homesite-by-home site optionality that just flows through. But on the other hand, you are running through land on a more cash-flow basis and redeploying that cash into better land over a shorter period of time.
Jon Jaffe: I thank very much to your point, Stuart, that describes underwriting land and the termining absorption pace of say four months we're at that time laying out a timeline for development to get to that finished home site Phil described, and then a timeline of start sequences at that four-month that's going to match. So it's really at the time of underwriting, we're almost making the decision of starting -- when we're going to start homes and with the pace and sequence that we're going to stick to.
Ken Zener: Very good. I guess my second question would simply be if you guys quantify the spread between what you saw in backlog and what became intra-quarter order closings in 1Q, comment on the 2Q spread if it exists or not. And if your share count guidance, Diane, for 2Q, what that effect would be if your exchange was fully executed? Thank you very much.
Diane Bessette: Well, if I look at the second quarter, just from a high level, what's in backlog and it's pretty close to that 18% and what we expect to sell and closes according to that as well and what we've experienced so far. So that's why, as Stuart mentioned, the margin will really be dependent on that sell and close as we go for third quarter. We don't have a lot of data behind us, right, since March 1, just a couple of weeks to the extent that the increases or decreases, our margin will be impacted because there is always a lot to sell and close in the same quarter. But right now, everything's hovering around the margin guidance that we gave.
Ken Zener: Excellent.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thanks, Ken. And let's end it there. I want to thank everyone for joining us. These are tricky times as we look at the housing industry. You can always count on getting a straight shot from Lennar. We're going to tell you where the market is and how we're addressing it and look forward to keeping you updated as we go forward through 2025. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: That concludes Lennar's first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect at this time and please enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-12-19 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Please continue to standby for today's conference call. The call will begin momentarily. Again, please continue to stand by and thank you for your patience. Welcome to Lenard's fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any questions, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins, for the reading of the forward looking statement.
David Collins: Today's conference call may include forward looking statements including statements regarding Lennard's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and prospects. Forward looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption "Risk Factors" contained in Lennar's most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and CEO. Stuart, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good, and thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining today. I am in Miami today with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, whom you just heard from, our Controller; and Vice President Fred Rothman, our Chief Operating Officer. Marshall Lane, Chairman of the Lennar Charitable Foundation, is also here, along with others. As usual, I will provide a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my remarks, Jon will provide an operational overview, updating some construction costs, cycle time, and aspects of our land strategy. Diane will then provide detailed financial highlights along with limited guidance for the first quarter of 2025. Following that, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period, and I would like to request that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many as possible. Let me begin. Our fourth quarter was challenging as interest rates climbed approximately one hundred basis points, affecting affordability. Beginning early in the quarter, we observed stalled sales at then-existing prices and incentive levels, necessitating increased incentives, interest rate buy-downs, and price adjustments to activate sales and avoid increased inventory buildup. Consequently, our fourth quarter results missed expectations: new orders were ninety-five short of the nineteen thousand we expected, and our gross margin was 22.1%, short of the 22.5% we anticipated. The shortfall in margin resulted from increased incentives on homes sold and delivered within the quarter. Accordingly, we are moderating our expectations for margins and sales in the first quarter of 2025 as the market adjusts and stabilizes. Overall, the economic environment, which we believed last quarter was constructive for the homebuilding industry, has certainly turned more challenging as long-term interest rates and mortgage rates have steadily risen since our last earnings call. Although underlying demand remains strong and supply is still limited, the combination of wavering consumer confidence and elevated acquisition costs has challenged consumers' ability and a desire to transact. While we continue to see considerable customer traffic, urgency to transact has waned as customers adjust to a new norm. Affordability has long been a limiting factor in accessing home ownership. Inflation and elevated interest rates have hindered an average family's ability to accumulate a down payment or qualify for a mortgage. Higher interest rates have locked in households with lower interest rate mortgages, curtailing the natural move-up as families expand. Rate buy-downs and incentives have enabled demand to access the market while consumers remain employed and confident their compensation will rise. However, higher interest rates and inflation have outstripped many consumers' ability or desire to act.  Strong employment typically correlates with a strong housing market, but higher interest rates sidelined many with a need for home purchases. Nonetheless, incentives and rate buy-downs have driven the market, and we expect demand to reestablish as rates stabilize or moderate, with pent-up demand building against short supply. While demand is restrained by affordability, supply remains constrained due to a chronic housing shortage, worsened by low demand, localized land restrictions, higher impact fees, and elevated construction costs. Local leaders across the country are acutely aware of the housing shortfall. On a final note, issues such as immigration and tariffs have emerged as potential concerns but are not expected to majorly impact us or the industry in the immediate term. Against this backdrop, we maintain conviction in our operating strategy focused on volume. Our execution in Q4 was challenged by rapid interest rate changes, leading to adjusting pricing and incentives to manage inventory levels effectively. The focus is now on maintaining sales volume to correct previously missed targets, though this incurs added margin pressure. For the first quarter of 2025, we expect to sell and deliver between seventeen thousand and seventeen thousand five hundred homes with margins between 19% and 19.25%, acknowledging that approximately half of expectations derive from backlog. We focus on driving sales for robust current cash flow, even with reduced profitability, to maintain managed inventory levels, positioning us for benefit upon market conditions’ normalization. Moreover, we progress toward an asset-light operational configuration, transitioning from a land-heavy company to a land-light manufacturing model, bolstering predictability and growth against a lower asset and risk profile. The strategic rework will align with executing our Rausch Coleman combination's value, affirming volume’s yielding efficient operational structures and dependable cash flow. This strategy supports our ability to systematically procure and develop land parcels for ongoing residential construction efforts. Let me briefly turn back to our operating results from the fourth quarter. While results fell short of initial expectations, they demonstrate strategic consistency given affordability challenges. As mortgage rates rose around 7%, we pursued volume through housing starts while incentivizing sales for affordability. We launched around eighteen and a half thousand starts, closed over twenty-two thousand homes, and addressed community count shortfalls crucially noted last quarter, increasing our community count from 1,283 to 1,447, thus positioning us better for volume at eased absorption rates. We anticipate lower absorption to ease stress on margins, with expected delivery between eighty-six and eighty-eight thousand homes in 2025 representing an 8% to 10% increase over 2024. Sales incentives in the fourth quarter increased to 10.8%, with reduced cycle time and construction costs largely countering affordability constraints and earlier community count lags. Operating strategies resulted in reduced cycle time, efficient cost control, and strategic land transactions, bolstering inventory churn to 1.6. Emphasizing volume has balanced our ongoing cash flow-driven repurchase of 3 million shares for $521 million in Q4, accumulating to a $2 billion yearly return. We close the quarter with $4.7 billion in cash, a 7.5% debt-to-capital ratio, positioning us for strategic motions like the Millrose spin and potential share repurchase continuation. Optimistic yet pragmatic, while challenging, we foresee a sustained supply-demand imbalance beneficial to our trajectory as conditions normalize and stabilize.  With our steady-state operating model of volume and gradual normalized inventory across increasing volume, and the concluding shifts towards a land-light asset configuration, our focus solidifies on margin rationalization and capital efficiency. We anticipate cyclically renewed incentives and normalized margins on stabilized demand will drive bottom-line scalability significantly above current levels.  I am now optimistic about the Millro Spin and Rausch Coleman acquisition, complementing one another to greater broader strategic prospects. Milrose Properties, our subsidiary for facilitating the announced spin, recently filed an SEC registration statement available publicly. Following its anticipated public spinoff, this will symptomize our multi-year transition to an asset-light model, with Milrose standing as the first publicly listed land-banking REIT, handling our home site options, also called the "Hopper," offering timely fully developed home site inventories to Lennar and related ventures. Currently, the Hopper houses integrated acquisition, financing, and land development procedures spanning two decades, meant to steward strategic completeness in meeting diversification among home builders nationwide. Managed externally by Kennedy Lewis Investments, an institutional firm handling $17 billion in AUM, and bearing experience in both Lennar and the broader landscape, Milrose’s operational expenses are entirely covered by Kennedy Lewis via management fees, maintaining a streamlined employment strategy with zero own employees. Milrose is strategically aligned to generate consistent returns through Lennar-optioned home site transfers which yield predictable dividends. Revenue derived from initial deposits and sale proceeds of fully developed home sites are recycled into new land acquisitions, eliminating additional investor solicitations or financing dependency. Accordingly, Milrose offers a constant and organic capital source for Lennar alongside private equity programs, demonstrating an adaptive evolution in our land-light initiative. We expect Milrose to expand through balanced, inorganic opportunities, optimized cash flow generation, and superior equity returns. Milrose receives $5.2 billion of undeveloped land, around $1 billion in cash from Lennar, and further $900 million in land assets via Rausch Coleman acquisition. Lennar retains the WIP inventory and home building operations. We foresee Milrose's long-term partnership facilitating asset-light engagements with broader sustainable capital frameworks, and its $5.2 billion transfer representing a vital strategic link to our land-light strategy to date.  Lennar shareholders will receive an 80% share distribution of Milrose stock, translating to one Milrose share for every two Lennar shares, subsequently disposing of the remaining 20% held briefly for cashless equity exchange possibilities in aligning our homebuilding and operational foundation more closely with strategic growth principles and land asset optimization methods. In brief, Milrose underpins long-term strategic growth endeavors rationalizing cost structures with normalized volumes positioned alongside margin recoveries. On the acquisition front, our historic alignment with Rausch Coleman Homes aligns precisely with our strategic objectives to fortify operating efficiencies from its well-integrated integration into our national setup. Concluding on Rausch Coleman, their established market share excellence expands into significant segments where Lennar's presence is less entrenched, while Ray's Coleman community platform dovetails strategically into our operational execution ethos. Jon’s vast experience in this landscape will guide our continued collaborative excellence. So, informed by our extensive strategic clarifications, restless ambitions, cultural strides from leadership stability synchronized across growth markets, the invigorated regional count, integrated diligence, and exciting combinatorial value alliances convey our fundamental objective of holistic, transformative, iterative adaptability and engagement growth. With this foundational overview, I turn the floor to Jon Jaffe for the operational overview.
Jon Jaffe: Good morning, everyone. As you have heard from Stuart, our focus at Lennar remains on executing a consistent high-volume homebuilding manufacturing model using margin as a buffer against market variability. I will discuss our performance this fourth quarter in areas including sales pace, cost reduction, cycle time, and asset-light land positioning strategies. To start with, our ability to control sales pace is critical to aligning production pace. Although the fourth quarter held challenging sales conditions due to stagnating affordability, resulting in a community per month sales pace of 4.2 homes versus our start pace of 4.6, seeing that mortgage rates remained higher, we adjusted our pricing configurations accordingly to meet the current market reality. Despite early quarter slowdowns, we adapted by implementing incentive strategies flexibly, prominently mortgage rate buy-downs to meet the market affordability where it is. While market conditions did not unfold as anticipated, our divisions dynamically engaged with digital marketing approaches through the Lennar machine to maintain our needs. Thus, an assertive adjustment through digital leads and strategic pricing increased November’s pace to 4.6, enabling us to maintain an unsold inventory of two completed homes per community. Constructing operational credibility, despite the sales challenge previously posed, yields strategic benefits reaped in controlling construction costs and cycle times, through our commitment to even-flow production and manufacturing efficiencies enabled by our core product mapping. Costs reduced by 2% year-over-year despite inflationary pressures throughout, underscoring the efficacy of our builder-of-choice model. Cycle times were reduced by a further two days sequentially, showing the tangible benefits of strategic management, achieving 138 calendar days within our single-family homes, a consistent 14% reduction from last year. The potential ongoing impact of new tariffs on electronic component imports or a change in immigration policies is considered preferentially through our supply chain strategy of switching to domestically sourced timber and minimizing Chinese parts dependency. Externally affecting costs when subjected to tariffs would potentially range around $5,000 to $7,000 per unit if impacted. We tactically pursued equilibrium through strategic partnerships, represented in approximately $1.5 billion land investments underpinning 17,000 home sites within the fourth quarter. The execution focused starkly on asset-light leverage, reducing our land-owned exposure to 1.1 years and controlled homes to 82%, effectively optimizing the inventory churn to 1.6. By synchronizing prompt supply take-downs to our linear nationwide operating model momentum, we position Lennar pragmatically with prospective landbanks and sustained chartered growth. Concluding, an fourth quarter sales pacing difficulty in an adjusting mortgage-backed environment does prompt our adaptive strategy of market-priced selling. This approach, pursuing unflinching, even-flow, consistent high-volume manufacturing will underscore predictable delivery mechanisms leveraging Millrose’ asset light model. My acknowledgements to Lennar associates underpin this sustained trajectory. I will now turn it over to Diane for financial highlights.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. As Jon and Stuart provided, much operational color, I will highlight balance sheet developments and offer first-quarter estimates. As you heard, Lennar’s volume model maximizes returns through timely inventory transactions at suitable margins, ending fiscal with $4.7 billion cash, no borrowing from our $2.9 billion credit facility, rounding our total liquidity to $7.6 billion.  Pursuing balance sheet efficiencies and capital investment reductions have markedly advanced our land-light strategy, peaking at 82% controlled homesites and 1.1 years owned, a historic low. Owning 85k homesites and controlling 394k, our competitive portfolio strategically primes market presence directed towards a capital-efficient upgrowth strategy. Our Q4 land procurement totaled $2.1 billion, wherein 80% were ready for prompt construction iterations, thereby leveraging our manufacturing model. Moreover, 66% closed homes in Q4 derived from managed land structures, reinforcing our resourceful inventory churn increased to 1.6 while achieving a 29.2% return, aligning cash flow consistency with market adaptability. In debt maneuvers, no senior note redemptions occurred this quarter but subsumed over $7 billion reductions since 2018, truncating our homebuilding debt-to-capital ratio down to 7.5% at an all-time low, maintaining a prudent roadmap with zero debt maturity before May 2025. Complementing equity returns, Q4 marked share repurchases summing 3 million shares, aggregating full-year total purchases over $2 billion, alongside $135 million quarterly dividends. Aggregately over 2024, equity and debt stakeholders’ return approached $3.3 billion with equity rising near $28 billion, equating book value of $104 per share. Looking forward, our robust balance sheet, subdued leverage, and flexibility endorse confidence forging into 2025. First-quarter guidance relies on standardized delivery estimates devoid of Rausch Coleman and Millrose spinoff impacts: - Q1 orders forecast falls between 17,500 - 18,000 homes aligning sales momentum.
- Deliveries expecting range: 17,000 - 17,500, ensuring inventory translates to cash flow.
- Average sales price: ~$410k - $415k maintaining affordable market pricing. - Gross margin aimed at 19% - 19.25%, with Q1 remaining typically the marginal low year starter, shaped through field cost expensing, with anticipated Q1 marginal impact becoming breakeven across combined homebuilding categories. Additional assumptions revolve SG&A expenses within 8.7% - 8.8% anticipating costs conserving sales momentum. Financial service earnings aim breakeven with multifamily sector reflecting $10 million loss. Lennar secondary implies $20 million loss excluding market variation on technology investments. Corporate G&A as percentage revenue estimated 2.6% charitable contributions pegged per home delivery indicates tax rate 24.5%, 206 million average weighted share count guiding EPS between $1.60 - $1.80. Globally, delivering 86,000 - 88,000 homes remains on cue for 2025 pivots, including the acquisitive Rausch Coleman integration feature, allowing matured cash flow alignment. Let me transfer over to the operator for Q&A proceedings.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. Please limit to one question and one follow-up. If you would like to ask a question, you may press star one. To withdraw your question, press star two. Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. You may go ahead, sir.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail, definitely a lot going on right now, so I appreciate that.
Stuart Miller: You know, Alan, I think it's a combination of factors. I think the consumer, particularly at the entry-level, but even as you move up into the move-up level, acquiring a down payment in today's inflated environment is challenging. Prices have gone up, and although the rate of inflation has come down, it doesn't mean prices have come down. It is harder to accumulate a down payment, and it is harder to qualify for a mortgage. There's a combination of interest rates moving up and down, creating hesitancy in actually making purchasing decisions.  It is indeed a combination of factors, seasonality being among them. It just became more difficult to get buyers to decide to purchase. In our third quarter end, when interest rates trended down, we didn't see the same responsiveness to rates coming down, a shift noticed going into the fourth quarter as interest rates took an upward trajectory. There was a perceived surprise in the consumer side, sideling their participation. It became harder and harder to navigate the components of incentives, rate buy-downs, purchase price reductions, all of which are our tools. Navigating the nuances has become trickier, requiring more effort to incentivize consumers past hesitations.
Alan Ratner: Got it. I appreciate the additional color there. Then my second question is on pace versus price strategy. Given the current market subtlety, is there a lower bound on margin or an upper bound on incentives you're willing to explore to ensure targeted volume is still achieved?
Stuart Miller: We've cultivated conviction that consistent volume eventually benefits both land cost rationalizations and hard cost management. We'll adapt consistently to market conditions, maintaining volume while judiciously moderating incentives and margins as necessary. There's always room in extraordinary market conditions that might demand an overhaul of strategies, but as things normalize or stabilize, steady volume assists sustainability of both market dynamics and cost realization completions.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and Co-CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining today. I'm in Miami today together with Jon Jaffe, our Co CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross -- and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services, and a few others are here as well. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, update in construction costs, cycle time and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for our fourth quarter and full year year-end 2024. And then, of course, we'll have question and answer. As usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as possible. So, let me go ahead and begin. Overall, the economic environment remains very constructive for homebuilders. Demand remains very strong and the migration to lower interest rates will further activate that demand. Lower interest rates will enhance affordability, which will enable many more families to access and attain homeownership at the entry level, while growing families will be able to unlock value from existing homes, enabling them to move up to more bedrooms and more living space. More listings for existing homes will provide supply of entry-level homes, while driving more demand for move-up product. The dynamic of lower interest rates is likely to accelerate demand for both new and existing homes, while expanding access to homeownership. Of course, affordability has been a limiting factor for demand and access to homeownership to-date. Inflation and interest rates have hindered the ability of average families to accumulate a downpayment or to qualify for mortgage. Higher interest rates have also locked households in lower interest rate mortgages and curtailed the natural move-up as families expand and need more space. Rates buydowns and incentives have enabled demand to access the market to-date. Additionally, across the business landscape, narratives around challenged consumer confidence have peppered earnings calls. Lower rates and controlled inflation will likely boost that confidence. Consumers remain employed. They are generally confident that they will remain employed, and they generally believe that their compensation will rise. This is most often the foundation of a very strong housing market, and we believe that while confidence will ebb and flow, lower rates will stabilize confidence and the consumer will prioritize shelter and purchase as affordability enables them to do so. We firmly believe that lower rates and controlled inflation will build affordability, enabling more households to access either first-time homeownership or move-up purchase. While strong demand, enabled by incentives and mortgage rate buydown, has driven the new home market over the past two years, we fully expect an even stronger and more broad-based demand cycle as rates move lower. While demand has been and should remain strong, the supply of homes remains constrained. The well-documented chronic housing shortage is a result of years of underproduction. This shortage has been exacerbated by continuing shortfalls in production driven by restrictive land permitting and higher impact fees at local levels and higher construction costs across the housing landscape. This week's housing starts print at 1.36 million is a continuation of the shortfall in production that is needed for the current population and immigration, let alone catching up on the shortage. Mayors and governors across the country have become acutely aware of the housing shortage and shortfall in their respective geographies. Many have been pounding the table about the need for affordable housing, attainable housing and workforce housing in their markets. Awareness has begun to give way to the first signs of action and more recently even the national narrative has begun to acknowledge the need for programs that activate supply. Greater supply and greater access to homeownership enables the upward mobility and generational wealth building that has long been associated with building the middle-class through homeownership. It seems that as we begin to focus on solutions, strong demand and strong need will further illuminate the need for supply, and intensified narratives will pave the way to activate greater production. On a final note, immigration has been an additional interesting factor in the housing landscape. On one hand, the influx of immigrant population has expanded the labor pool and, therefore, offset the pressure on construction cost increases. On the other hand, the increase in population requires more supply of dwellings to house that growing population. Without politicizing this issue at this rather sensitive time, the new immigrant population will add to demand, while at the same time help to control production costs. This configuration is an overall positive for the new homebuilders, and it adds to our optimism as we look ahead. Overall, while there will be seasonality, incentives and perhaps some adjustments along the way, we are very optimistic that the road ahead appears very positive for our homebuilding business. Against that backdrop, as you can see from our third quarter results, we are adhering to our operating strategy focused on volume, while we are sprinting towards the completion of our five-year marathon of migrating our operating platform from an asset-heavy model to a land-light, asset-light, just-in-time-finished-home-site-delivery model. We have executed that migration without breaking stride -- without breaking the stride of delivering consistent and growing starts, sales and closing, and while driving the cash flow and bottom-line profitability that market conditions enable. We have literally reorganized the company, while we have operated day to day and quarter to quarter with consistent focus on bottom-line results. I want to emphasize that our North Star has been exactly this focus, on delivering growing volume with consistent cash flow and bottom-line results, while migrating to an asset-light model. This predictable volume and growth has been and will be the key to recasting our business model. First, it has enabled improving operating efficiencies in construction costs, cycle time, consumer -- customer acquisition costs and SG&A. Second, it has driven consistent and dependable cash flow and bottom-line results. And third, it has enabled the consistent and predictable takedown of just-in-time-delivered fully-developed homesites that has attracted capital to the structured land banking partnership that has driven the nearly $20 billion of transactions that have enabled our land-light transformation to-date. Since 2020, when we began our financial and operating transformation, the results and comparisons have been rather dramatic and are worthy of some reflection. Since 2020, when we began this journey, we have reduced our year's supply of land owned from three years' supply to an expected 1.1 year at the end of this year. We have increased our controlled homesites from 43% controlled to 81% controlled expected at the end of the year. And we have increased our inventory turn from under 1 time turn to approximately 1.6 times turn. While our deliveries have gone from approximately 53,000 to a projected 80,500 to 81,000 for a 53% growth rate, our total owned inventory has actually remained flat. We are clearly doing a lot more with a lot less as our return on inventory has grown from 16% in 2020 to a forecasted 30%-plus at year-end this year. But perhaps even more importantly, we have paid down approximately $4.9 billion of debt. By year-end, we will have repurchased approximately 50 million shares of stock for approximately $5.7 billion. And by year-end, we will have distributed approximately $1.9 billion in dividends since 2020. And after all of that, we have a debt to total capital ratio of 7.6%, down from approximately 25% in 2020, and currently we have $4 billion of cash on book. So, how do we do that? Well, first, we consistently adhere to our strategy that starts with the results like our third quarter, focused on growth and volume. And second, we attracted capital with our consistent volume and built capital and operating infrastructure that produces -- that purchases and develops land and delivers fully developed homesites on a just-in-time basis for about one-half of our needed homesites. And now, and third, we will complete this transaction for the other one-half of our land needs and enhance what we have started with our spin-off [Millrose] (ph). Let me break this down. First of all, we are very pleased with our third quarter results as they represent another consistent and strategic quarter of operating results and execution for Lennar. The market for new homes remained consistent with strong demand challenged by affordability. As mortgage rates remained higher around 7% through the first half of our quarter, we added volume with starts, while we incentivized sales to enable affordability as we know that consistent volume and resulting operating efficiencies will continue to attract capital to our asset-light strategy, which will be our greatest strength as interest rates decline. In our third quarter, we increased starts by 8% year-over-year to almost 20,250, we increased new orders by 5% year-over-year to 20,000 -- almost 20,600, and we increased deliveries by 16% year-over-year to just over 21,500. As we have focused on volume, however, we have hit the bump of some communities selling out and closing out faster than expected and others facing entitlement and development delays to expected start dates. As community count fell, we adjusted and pushed volume with greater absorption levels in existing communities, which naturally impacted our margin. We still expect to deliver between 80,500 and 81,000 homes in 2024, more than a 10% increase over 2023. We also expect to continue into 2025 with an expected 10% growth rate as we increased community count somewhat in the third quarter to 1,283 communities and we expect to be above 1,400 communities by the year -- by year-end 2024. We expect the impact of the community count lag to correct over the next couple of quarters. During the quarter, sales incentives rose to just over 10%, as interest rates remained high and we addressed affordability and the community count lag. As an offset, we were able to reduce construction costs and cycle time, and Jon will detail that shortly, and we reduced our customer acquisition cost and our SG&A to 6.7% versus an expected 7.3% as we leveraged our volume to increase efficiencies in our operating platform. While our gross margin came in lower than we expected at 22.5%, our net margin was higher than expected at 15.8%, driven by operating efficiencies, and we ended the quarter with earnings per share, excluding one-time items, of $3.90. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, given seasonality and customers adjusting to a changing interest rate environment, we expect our gross margin to remain flat as customers build confidence in the changing economic and interest rate landscape. We also expect to see further improvement in our operating efficiencies. As we have driven production pace in sync with sales pace, we have used our margin as a point of adjustment to enable consistent production as market conditions have continued to adjust. Our strategy has enabled us to repurchase another 3.4 million shares of stock for $519 million and end the quarter with $4 billion of cash on book and a 7.6% debt to total capital ratio. We have driven excellent operating results to-date and we continue to be excellently positioned as a company from balance sheet to operating strategy to execution to be able to adjust and address the market as it unfolds for the remainder of 2024 and beyond. So, with the growing -- with the growth and production strategy driving our core business, we embarked on a program to develop a structured and durable land strategies model to systemically purchase and develop land with an option program to purchase fully-developed homesites just in time and as needed. While we had always executed option land deals with third-party developers, and we still do, those deals were not always available and there were simply no developers in many of our markets. We knew that we could only become structurally and durably land-light and asset-light by both negotiating option deals with landowners and developers and also creating structured land option contracts with private equity capital or permanent capital. Our drive to build an asset-light manufacturing model has been a five-year marathon that has required a slow but steady attraction of capital to the concept, supported by an operational plumbing system to support the flow of capital and the delivery of homesites. Additionally, there needed to be a fiduciary for that capital that would oversee the generation of attractive returns to capital at market competitive, risk adjusted returns, while also allowing for appropriate profitability for the manufacturer, namely us. Additionally, the notion of land risk needed to be reconsidered. Not all land has the same risk. Short-term land, which is entitled and mostly developed, is less risky than unentitled farmland. Mixed risk profiles have historically and would always price to the most risky part of the pool. Accordingly, we have worked with a series of private equity partners to create homogeneous risk profile land assets. These assets are priced for their risk profile and are professionally managed through a homesite purchase platform, which we call The Hopper. The Hopper is where land is acquired, held and developed, and ultimately delivered just in time on a rolling option basis with contractually controlled and limited risk to the manufacturer homebuilder as homes are ready to be started. Over time, the management of these land relationships has become second nature to our division management and has actually driven greater efficiency and effectiveness in the management of our land assets. The assignment of risk profile defines the cost of capital. The orchestration of just-in-time delivery of homes becomes as visible and critical as the delivery of lumber and appliances, and the process is becoming increasingly automated for efficiency. But by driving volume through these programs, we have gained advantaged insights into the unique value that these structures are now bringing to the overall company. Aside from the financial improvements outlined earlier, five additional insights immediately come to mind. First, as capital markets become familiar and comfortable with a term based risk, more capital comes to that understood risk and that expands the capital that is available for these types of terms of land. Second, capital markets get comfortable with a particular risk profile and the cost of capital can go down as capital is matched with associated risk. Third, the availability of strategic capital for smaller M&A transactions does not tie up corporate capital while home production is ramped up, and this promotes growth strategies. Fourth, M&A transactions can be absorbed with fewer complicated accounting implications. And fifth, organic growth in existing markets and into new markets can be facilitated with limited balance sheet impact where there's no existing land developers. As I mentioned in our last call, I do want to specifically highlight our unique and very important relationship with TPG Angelo Gordon and Ryan Mollett. We began this journey together back in 2020 and we learned together that we're significantly better for having endured the bumps and bruises of learning and growing. They have come to -- they continue to be our single biggest land partner and we look forward to much more learnings and growing as we grow into the future. Bottom-line, our asset-light land-light strategy is evolving and we are getting better at understanding all the benefits. Finally, in the very near future, the spin-off, which we call Millrose, will generally complete this now almost five-year migration to an asset-light operating model. Not surprisingly, we've received a lot of questions about the planned spin-off we announced during the second quarter earnings call. We're still going through the SEC confidential review process, so I'm limited in what I can say about the spin-off. However, I can tell you a bit -- a little bit about what it will entail and how it will affect Lennar. We have formed a company called Millrose Properties Inc., which we expect to qualify as a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT. Millrose will acquire and develop land for Lennar and other homebuilders as -- and will deliver fully-developed homesites under a land option contract. The acquisition, development and delivery of homesites will be similar to other partners -- partnerships that I've just described a little earlier. The REIT structure, however, is unique and will be detailed in the S-11 SEC registration statement when it is made public soon. We are going to contribute to Millrose in exchange for its stock, essentially all of our undeveloped, partially developed and some of our fully developed land along with cash. The stock will be distributed as a stock dividend of Millrose stock to Lennar shareholders and it will accordingly reduce inventory on Lennar's books. That capital, as it cycles within Millrose, will continue to be permanent dependable capital available to Lennar for future land options as further described in the S-11 registration statement when it is made public. Millrose will be responsible for advancing the capital for developing the land contributed, using Lennar as a contractor for consistent execution, and Lennar will have option contracts entitling it to repurchase finished homesites on a just-in-time basis and as needs -- as it needs them for homebuilding activities. Proceeds from the repurchased finished homesite will be reinvested by Millrose in new land and development transactions for Lennar. Additionally, after the spin-off, the new company would be another additive bucket of capital consistent and compatible with other relationships that have existed and will continue to thrive alongside Lennar. Of course, the completion of our spin will drive significantly higher returns on inventory and equity as both inventory and equity are reduced by the amount of assets contributed to Millrose in exchange for stock. Given Lennar's balance sheet strength with a debt to total capital ratio of 7.6%, Lennar's balance sheet will remain very strong after the spin-off with, we believe, consistent earnings and cash flow to continue to pay down debt and repurchase stock. Because Lennar's inventory is constantly changing, we don't know exactly how much land Lennar will contribute to Millrose, but we expect that it will be land and cash with a book value of between $6 billion and $8 billion and we expect that Millrose will seek to enter into land transactions with other builders as well as an independent company. Since the land and cash contributed to Millrose will be debt-free, Millrose will be completely independent as a company with zero Lennar ownership and will be responsible for arranging credit facilities and sources of any debt or equity financing it needs or wants to support its own activities. Lennar will have option purchase arrangements to purchase back finished homesites on a just-in-time basis. Unlike other land companies that rely on land appreciation for returns, Millrose will receive contractual option fees for maintaining options in effect. It will use these fees to pay its expenses and to make regular distributions to stockholders. In addition to option fees, Millrose will also receive the return of invested capital associated with the option exercises. Unlike traditional private equity based land banking funds, Millrose will not be required to distribute or return invested capital to investors. Instead, Millrose will repeatedly reinvest the invested capital as it is returned in future land transactions. Therefore, Millrose will be for Lennar and probably other homebuilders essentially a self-renewing permanent source of land acquisition and development capital. Now, while I'd like to go into more detail about the planned spin-off, as I noted earlier, we're still limited in what we can say until our S-11 SEC registration statement is made public, so more information should become publicly available very soon. So, in conclusion, let me say that this is a very exciting time for Lennar. At Lennar, we're continuing to upgrade the Lennar financial and operating platform as we drive consistent production and sales. Our third quarter 2024 has been another strong, strategic and operational success for our company as we focus on driving consistent volume and growth, adjust community count for that growth, and complete our company's financial and operational restructure. We are, in fact, nearing the end of a five-year marathon that will have restructured our entire operating platform for long-term success and greater returns on capital and equity. We have continued to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across the market. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize, and now that the Fed has boldly begin to -- begun to cut rates, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated and we are well-prepared with growing community count and growing volume. Strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market at higher interest rates. As rates drift down, given consistent execution, we are extremely well-positioned for even greater success as strong demand for affordable offerings continues to seek short supply in more affordable interest rate environment. Perhaps most importantly, our strong balance sheet affords us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful growth for our future. In that regard, we will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to use our land partnerships to grow with a focus on high returns on capital and equity. We will also continue to focus on our pure-play business model and reduce exposure to non-core assets. We'll continue to drive just-in-time homesite delivery and an asset-light balance sheet, and we'll continue to allocate capital to growth, debt retirement and stock repurchases, as appropriate. As we complete our asset-light transformation, we will continue to execute in the short term, while we return capital to our shareholders through dividend and stock buyback, while we also pursue strategic growth. As we look ahead to completing a successful 2024, we're well-positioned for and expect to see much more of the same in the years ahead. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, perform and drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance. For now, we are guiding to 22,500 to 23,000 closings next quarter, with a margin that is flat with the third quarter, and we expect to deliver approximately 80,500 to 81,000 homes this year. We also expect to repurchase in excess of $2 billion of stock this year as we continue to drive very strong cash flow. We look forward to a strong finish to 2024. And for that, I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus, effort and talent. And with that, let me turn over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Good morning. As you heard from Stuart, our operational teams at Lennar continue to focus on executing our operating strategies, while responding in real time to market fluctuations throughout the quarter. This intense focus creates a continuous learning and refinement loop, which in turn continuously improves the execution of these strategies. I will discuss our third quarter performance and cost reduction, cycle time reduction and improved asset-light land position. Our focus on improvement in these areas begins with sales pace. Knowing we can produce a rate of sales by design creates a confidence for the production side of the business. We work on improving the Lennar Machine to produce the needed volume of high-quality leads. This starts at the top of the funnel with testing the effectiveness of targeting through various sources such as SEM or social media and messaging such as rate and payment or lifestyle, all the way through to the ultimate result of a purchase and sale agreement. Every day our divisions learn from their engagement with Lennar Machine constantly adjusting and testing new tactics. This by-design approach drives efficiency and customer acquisition costs, while also improving the customer experience. We utilize incentives and interest rate buydowns as needed to enable us to address affordability and consumer confidence challenges in order to achieve the desired sales pace. This process, against the backdrop of higher interest rates and the impact on consumer from inflation, informed us as to where we needed the buydown of interest rates and/or other incentives to achieve the desired pace. As noted, our third quarter sales pace of 5.5 homes per community per month matched our start pace of 5.4. Achieving the sales pace also resulted in ending the quarter with an average of just more than 1 unsold completed home per community. The resulting confidence from consistently producing the desired sales pace enables planning for an even flow start pace and related production levels. Our goal of the manufacturing process derives from this predictability, which drives improvements in direct construction costs and cycle time. All participants in our operations, trade partners and supply chain partners benefit from the combination of this predictability along with our high volume. This manufacturing approach along with the maximized efficiencies of our [indiscernible] strategy will allow us to continue to drive down cost and cycle time into 2025. In the third quarter, our construction cost decreased sequentially from Q2 by over 1% and on a year-over-year basis by over 6%. Accomplishing a 6% cost reduction during the inflationary environment of the past year demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy and affirms the benefits of our builder-of-choice approach. This manufacturing strategy resulted in continued significant gains in cycle time. In our third quarter, cycle time decreased by 10 days sequentially from Q2 down to 140 calendar days on average for single family homes, which is a 23% decrease year-over-year and a material contributor to our inventory churn improvement. Next, I'll discuss the execution of our land-light strategy. In the third quarter, we continued to effectively work with our strategic land developers and landbank partners, where they purchased land on our behalf and then delivered just-in-time finished homesites to our homebuilding machine. In the third quarter, about 82% of our $2 billion or approximately 17,000 homesites acquired in the quarter were finished homesites purchased from these various land structures. During the quarter, our landbanks acquired on our behalf about 15,000 homesites for around $800 million in land acquisition and a commitment of about $650 million in land development. With this focus on being asset-light, our supply of owned homesites decreased to 1.1 years down from 1.5 years and controlled homesite percentage increased to 81% from 73% year-over-year. These improvements in the execution of our operating strategies enable reduced cycle time and less land owned resulting in improved inventory churn, which now stands at 1.6 versus 1.4 last year, a 14% increase. As in prior quarters, the third quarter showed continued progress in execution of each of these strategies that Stuart and I reviewed. We started with a focus on Lennar marketing and sales machine, leading to even flow manufacturing-light production and asset-light land strategies. We focused on improving and connecting these strategies together driving even more consistency and improvement. In our third quarter, as interest rates fluctuated and consumers felt the pressure of inflation, we managed nimbly with the aid of new technology-driven tools in the form of real-time data dashboards. The consistent digestion and critical review of the data allows for quick action and improved execution. I want to add my thanks to the associates for their commitment to implementing and executing these strategies. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So, Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So, therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments, pull together again our balance sheet highlights and then provide guidance for Q4. So, starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our Financial Services team had operating earnings of $144 million. These earnings were fairly consistent with the prior year. While we had lower lock volume and net secondary margins in our mortgage business, this was partially offset by higher delivery volume and lower cost in our title business. Our Financial Services team is intensely dedicated to providing a great customer experience for each homebuyer and has created true partnerships with our homebuilding teams to accomplish that goal. That partnership is reflected in their solid results. Moving into Multifamily, for the quarter, our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of $79 million. The primary driver of earnings was the gain on sale of assets in our LMV Fund I. As we noted last quarter, we are under contract to sell the assets to multiple buyers. In the third quarter, we closed about 70% of the anticipated sales. We recorded a net gain of $179 million and received about $140 million of cash. We expect most of the remaining assets to be sold in the fourth quarter. A second component for the quarter was a $90 million write-down of non-core assets that are held on book as we focus on immediately monetizing these assets. This is consistent with our pure-play asset-light strategy and with the ultimate goal of increasing returns. So, turning to the balance sheet, this quarter, once again, we adhered to our strategy of maximizing return on inventory by turning our inventory at the appropriate market -- margin. The results of these actions was that we drove cash flow and ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.2 billion revolving credit facility. This provided total liquidity of $6.2 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investment, we, once again, made significant progress on our goal of becoming land-light. As Jon mentioned, at quarter-end, our years owned improved to 1.1 years from 1.5 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increased to 81% from 73% in the prior year, our lowest years owned and highest controlled percentage in our history. At quarter-end, we owned 87,000 homesites and controlled 369,000 homesites for a total of 456,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital efficient way. We spent $2 billion on land purchases this quarter. However, over 80% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis, which is less capital intensive. Of the homes closed during the quarter, approximately 64% were from our third-party land structures when we purchased those homesites on a finished basis. As we continue to reduce our ownership in land and purchase homesites on a just-in-time basis, our earnings should more consistently approximate cash flow and, over time, it would be our goal to align capital return to shareholders more closely with that cash flow. And finally, our inventory turn was 1.6 times, up from 1.4 times last year, and our return on inventory was 31.3%, up 324 basis points from last year. During the quarter and consistent with our production focus, we started about 20,200 homes and ended the quarter with about 40,000 homes in inventory. This inventory number includes approximately [1,750] (ph) homes that were completed unsold, which is slightly more than one home per community as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. Looking at our debt maturity profile, we had no redemption or repurchases of senior notes this quarter. Our next debt maturity is not until May of 2025. We continue to benefit from our previous paydowns of senior notes and strong earnings generation which brought our debt to total capital down to 7.6% at quarter-end, our lowest ever and a strong improvement from 11.5% in the prior year. The significant decrease in leverage is one of the factors that allowed us to receive an upgrade in our debt ratings from Fitch from BBB to BBB+. We are pleased to achieve this accomplishment that recognizes the strength of our balance sheet and our operating platform. Consistent with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns, we repurchased 3.4 million of our outstanding shares for $519 million. Additionally, we paid total dividends this quarter of $136 million. Finally, our stockholders' equity increased to over $27 billion, and our book value per share increased to just over $101. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through the remainder of 2024 and beyond. So, with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q4 and provide some guidance estimates. Starting with new orders. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 19,000 to 19,300 homes, which approximates a 10% year-over-year growth. We also expect our year-end community count to be about 10% to 12% greater than last year. We anticipate our Q4 deliveries to be in the range of 22,500 to 23,000 homes with a continued manufacturing focus on turning inventory into cash. Our Q4 average sales price on those deliveries should be about $425,000, as we continue to price the market to reach affordability. We expect gross margins to be flat with Q3, and our SG&A to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%, with both estimates dependent on market conditions. For the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to generate earnings of about $25 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings to be approximately $140 million, and we expect to be about breakeven in our Multifamily business. Turning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of about $5 million, excluding the impact of any potential mark-to-market adjustment to our public technology investment. Our Q4 corporate G&A should be about 1.7% of total revenues, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our Q4 tax rate to be approximately 24.25%, and the weighted average share count should be approximately 267 million shares. And so, on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.10 to $4.25 per share for the quarter. And also, we also remain confident with our cash flow generation. As such, as Stuart mentioned, we are still targeting a minimum of $2 billion of share repurchases for fiscal 2024. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Wow, thank you for all of that detail. Still digesting everything, Stuart, but sounds like you guys have definitely been busy and...
Stuart Miller: It's a lot to take in, no questions.
Alan Ratner: Yeah. So, I guess, recognizing you might be limited on what you could say on Millrose, just because you gave some color there, I'll start on that front. I'm curious as you kind of went through this process or are going through the process and maybe comparing and contrasting the various structures you've had over the years on the land side and kind of come up with how you envision Millrose is going forward, I think one of the things you mentioned that sounds a little bit different is just kind of like the fees that the business or the company will earn on these option deals. And I'm curious from your perspective as the manufacturer and as the builder, what margin impact would you expect that to have relative to the current land banking structures you currently have? Is it going to be materially different? It sounds like it might be more beneficial to Millrose or at least more predictable to them, if you will, but I might be misinterpreting that.
Stuart Miller: So, within the boundaries of what I can and can't say, let me say it this way, Alan. It's a good question. So, what I tried to detail in my comments is that think about Millrose as being a mirror image of our other structures. The single biggest differential is the capital component, which is a permanent capital structure versus one where the capital has to be raised repeatedly. So, we structured this as a REIT, as I said, and it's structured through it being a public company as permanent capital that does where the capital itself does not get returned. But aside from that, as we look at what we have done with our -- with the first half, let's say, it's more or less half, of our developed homesites that have been used in production as we've migrated over the past years, we expect that the impact will be basically similar. And it's been a relatively small impact on our margin as we have absorbed option costs, which exist in all of those relationships. And we have included or benefited from efficiencies that have come from the way that we've managed land and the way that we're managing our overall business. Now, can I point to specifics as how the offsets actually happen? It's not quite that linear, but we think that the impact is going to be relatively small.
Alan Ratner: Got it. I appreciate that, and that's helpful. So, looking forward to seeing it all unfold. Second, just on the gross margin, I'm sure you're expecting lots of questions on this, but relative to where you were three months ago, six months ago, kind of expecting more of a ramp this year as opposed to now more of kind of flattish through the year on gross margin, just curious what, I guess, surprised you relative to what you would have expected three months ago. Because it doesn't seem -- if anything, rates have come down about 100 basis points since June. It seems like August was a pretty decent month based on some of the macro data and commentary from other builders. Yet, you are expecting a lower margin in Q4 than you maybe articulated three months ago. So, what was the main driver for that revised outlook?
Stuart Miller: Well, first of all, let's say, let's start by recognizing that really rates did not start coming down until later into our quarter. For the first half or more of the quarter, rates were kind of sticky up at a 7% kind of range. And that cast a pretty tough affordability cloud on what was happening in the market. And consumer confidence has been slow to kind of kick in as rates have kind of fallen over the second part of the quarter. So, I think that stickiness has kind of been a differentiating factor and that's market driven. I think that there is the confluence within our environment of managing the relationship between our reduced cycle times and the fall off of community and community count and some communities not coming on as quickly as we had hoped. And that driving, in our world, a need -- given our drive to volume and growth, our need and desire to keep the volume up at a time when interest rates are high, consumer confidence hasn't really kicked in and our community count kind of falls, increasing our absorption rates. So, that's what's kind of come as a differentiating fact as we have continued to migrate towards our restructuring. And maybe that's what's different between us and others is that we're focused on keeping that volume up, so that we can facilitate where we're headed and to a program that we think is going to put us in much better stead for the future and that's driven us forward to drive volume at a time when interest rates are high, consumer confidence has been waning a little bit and our community count dropped a little bit. We think that's self-correcting over the next quarters, and we think it's solving to a greater good.
Alan Ratner: Appreciate it. Thanks for all the info.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Yeah, thanks a lot guys. It's obvious you've been busy this summer. So, I appreciate all the information you've given so far. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on your most recent answer to Alan. With respect to volume growth, I know you're guiding to 10% volume growth next year, but I think you just sort of indicated that some of this is in an effort to make sure that you progress towards your restructuring in as helpful a manner or in a smooth a manner as you can. So, maintaining volume maybe when others tweak to down their volume can be explained in a way near term and in this past quarter by the fact that you're progressing towards this Millrose REIT, the launching of that REIT. So, my question relates to the longer term. If we move beyond, when you've -- let's say, you've accomplished your goals with Millrose, longer-term, others in the industry have seemingly been moderating their long-term targets to more of a 5% to 10% volume range. And I'm curious, can you talk about what you think is the proper long-term rate of growth for Lennar, longer term that is. And is that dependent upon a certain rate of national housing starts growth or mortgage rates staying below a certain level or something like that? Just kind of give us a sense for long term where you think volume growth should be.
Stuart Miller: So, right now, we're kind of solving to a 10% steady state growth rate. And part of that, Steve, relates to our view of what our land strategy has become. The more we are focused on our asset-light model, the more we are seeing that we can dovetail a combination of organic growth and strategic new market growth that is facilitated by the structure of the way that our operations will be configured as we go forward. So, we're kind of looking at more of a steady state 10%. Now, this kind of dovetails with what we think has to happen in terms of building a healthier housing market. Remember that, nationally, we're supply constrained. At local markets, there's supply constrained. And the market is going to need additional supply of homes, particularly as interest rates drift down, particularly as at the local and at the national level, the world focuses on greater volume and greater supply to accommodate the population as it sits right now. Now, we're seeing and hearing that narrative come across pretty loudly even at the national level. And we think that we're positioned to dovetail with what has to be a growth in production levels. And I don't know what new normal is. The print more recently was 1.36 million. That seems light, and it doesn't seem like we're catching up on the supply side. So, we're building a model that we think facilitates our ability to participate in growing a healthier housing market, which means greater supply, accommodating the demand that is pent-up and limited by affordability.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Yeah, that's fair enough. Appreciate that. The second half of my question relates to operating margins. I think that maybe the story for some investors this quarter was that you made a -- you brought the trade-off between volume and margin a little bit more into sharper relief. And so, with respect to the operating margin, and I'm talking about your operating margin after corporate expense, it seems based on your guidance that you're going to be coming in somewhere a little north of 13% this year, which is quite a bit below some of your bigger cap peers. And I'm curious if you could share why you think this is the case and whether this level is in-line with where you think your operating profitability is going to be over the long term. Yeah, I guess, we'll stop there.
Stuart Miller: So, I think you started by saying it sounds like we had a busy summer. In actual fact, the biggest part of the busy summer has been focused on the operations and efficiencies that we inject as we migrate our business to asset-light, but more importantly, as we grow volume using that volume to build efficiencies in the way that we execute and drive a net margin, an operating margin that can -- that starts to grow into where we're headed as an operating model. So, I can't lay out the pathway to where we're going in specificity, but I think that we believe, I know that we believe that our operating margins are going to grow as we go forward. And as we settle into what becomes a normalized full-bodied asset-light approach rather than the building of the approach actually executing it will enable us to get more and more efficient.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Well, great. We'll be waiting for that, but appreciate all the color in the meantime. Thanks, guys.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Susan Maklari: Yes. Thank you, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question is, Stuart, given the commentary that you gave around the strategic shift that's coming through as well as Jon's comments on the operational improvements that you're focused on, can you talk a bit about the upside to those inventory turns, which obviously moved really nicely this quarter already, and what that means for the cash generation of the business as we think about the next year?
Stuart Miller: Well, we've seen this kick in over these past few years. And that is as we improve our inventory turn, it just accelerates our cash flow and enables us to be far more efficient in the way that we run our business. Now, creating these efficiencies and embedding them in 40 divisions across the country right now, it takes a little bit of time to get all of these things operating in a consistent flow through all the divisions, but division by division, that's exactly what we're doing, focusing on that inventory turn. And we think, over time, it will trend significantly higher than it is right now. Part of the time that it takes to get there is that we've only affected about half of our delivery system at this point. And as we get more proficient with a full-bodied approach to an asset-light approach, we think that that inventory turn is going to continue to climb.
Diane Bessette: And, Susan, I would just add just to think about it simplistically, as we've said, the goal really is to have our cash flow generation equal our net earnings. And as you think about the usage of that cash, our debt maturity ladder, that definitely been reducing with our paydowns and not refinancing, so that leaves a fair amount of cash to be deployed back into shareholders.
Susan Maklari: Yes. Okay. And building on that, perhaps, you did end the quarter, you had $4 billion of cash on the balance sheet, how are you thinking about the amount of cash that you need to hold going forward given the strategy that you'll be operating under and the uses of that extra cash?
Stuart Miller: So, as I've said in past calls, one of the big questions from many of our investors and analysts has been, aren't you carrying a little bit more cash or maybe even materially more cash than you need? And we've said that we are carrying that as we evolve our business program and think about exactly what the configuration of Millrose is going to look like. I know it seems like we've been taking a lot of time on this. This is hard work and harder than some might think getting this configuration right actually is. So, the cash that we're holding is what I would call safety stock relative to cash in terms of defining exactly what we're spinning off, because it is a moving target, exactly what we're spinning off and what component of cash actually goes into Millrose as well. And that is a matter of strategy that we'll discuss further as we file our S-11 in a public format in the near future and as we have further conversations. So, I just have to say, it's kind of trust me right now. We're holding the cash right now as safety stock. It's not needed for the operations of the business, but it is needed for consideration as to how we move forward.
Susan Maklari: Yeah. Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank you, and good luck with everything.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Rehaut: Good afternoon, Stuart.
Stuart Miller: Right. Did it switch over? Yeah.
Michael Rehaut: So, wanted to delve in a little bit more on the land spin. I know, obviously, you remain a little limited on fully what you can say, but I think there's a lot of devil in the details here that we will be interested in trying to gauge. You talked about, I think, last quarter $6 billion to $8 billion of land. I think the language this quarter was $6 billion to $8 billion of land and cash. Was hoping to get any kind of rough sense of how much of the cash portion of that would -- the cash portion would represent. Also roughly the stock received in exchange, if there's any kind of, again, range or degree of magnitude that we should think about? And lastly, if it would affect your cost structure at all by spinning off all of these assets, I don't know, if there's also any associated personnel that might result in a reduction of corporate G&A or your SG&A?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So, let me start by saying that the words that we would spend $6 billion to $8 billion of land versus $6 billion to $8 billion of land and cash might have been a foot fault on my part. It really hasn't changed. The notion has not changed from quarter-to-quarter. It was always that there would be a cash component, and exactly what that is -- as I said, it's moving around. Remember that we're contributing to Millrose, a moving set of assets that are constantly some coming in, some going out on a rotating basis. And that's where -- until we kind of get to the end, we won't know exactly what the numbers are. There's also a strategic component of how we're configuring Millrose, but again, that falls into the category of what I can't talk about. You might have noticed that our discussion has been almost exclusively on impacts to Lennar rather than too much information on the configuration of Millrose. So, I can't quite go there yet, but this is going to come to market pretty soon. So, I just would say be patient on that. And I think that a lot of the rest of your question falls into that category as well. There will be very limited personnel movement relative to Millrose. So, the impact to Lennar on SG&A will only be in the context of efficiencies in how we run our business, not in terms of personnel migrating outside of the Lennar environment.
Diane Bessette: And, Mike, just one clarification, it sounded like there might be a little confusion. As we contribute our assets to Millrose, that will be in exchange for Millrose stock, but Lennar will not be holding that Millrose stock, that will be stock dividend that is distributed to our shareholders. So, it sounds like there might be a little confusion on that, just wanted to clarify.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. No, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. Secondly, again, I just wasn't fully, I guess, kind of appreciate maybe the answer earlier on the gross margin question around -- last quarter, kind of the arrows were pointing closer to 25% or so. Now, you're looking at closer to 22.5%. And just wanted to better appreciate, again, kind of what's changed in the last 90 days. And you kind of alluded to a couple of different factors. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but seemingly a pretty different degree of magnitude shift here. And if this is also something that is more temporary given some of the factors perhaps around Millrose relative to kind of initially at least how we should think about fiscal '25 on the ongoing business?
Stuart Miller: Yeah. I think as I've said, all of this kind of melts into one kind of articulation, and that is our margin story derives from, number one, interest rates staying higher for a little bit longer through this quarter. Consumer confidence kind of waning. We've heard this in a lot of conference calls. Even as interest rates have come down, the consumer has been a little sticky in terms of -- they're jumping back into the housing market. And the changes in community count driving at a time when demand has been limited by affordability. And then, pushing volume by increasing absorption rates within communities has kind of pushed our margin. And we said clearly in our last earnings call that, look, we're going to focus on volume, generating a consistent volume and growth trajectory. And we are going to use our margin as that shock absorber. And the confluence of these pieces together with the spin-off and the asset-light approach that we've taken has reflected exactly that way. And we've been irreverent about using our margin to make sure that we're maintaining the volume and projecting to where we think the long-term benefit is for the company.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Okay. You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trevor Allinson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Trevor Allinson: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to follow up on SG&A. You had really good SG&A control in the quarter. It sounds like some of your internal efficiencies are driving tangible results. You called out the technology benefits. You also mentioned in your press release lower broker costs driving the SG&A. The NAR settlement just went into effect not long ago. So, I was hoping you could talk about maybe some of the changes you're making with brokers, if any, whether that's moving more to a flat fee, adjusting the rate you're paying, any net impact from those, and then perhaps maybe your views more generally on broker usage.
Stuart Miller: Yeah. A number of people have asked us about our strategy relative to realtors. I put this under the heading of building a healthier housing market. Our focus has been on trying to take out as many unnecessary costs from the housing transaction in order to build affordability for our customers. Realtors, we have a great respect for the realtors. They bring us business. And we cooperate and work with realtors, but at the same time, we've been focused on bringing down that realtor cost where it is not necessary because, conceptually, it just adds to the cost of the home. And to the extent that we can repurpose that where a realtor really isn't involved, to bring down the cost of the home for customers, we think we're building a better housing market. If you look at our production, our volume, we are able -- with a more robust marketing program -- digital marketing program, we are able to maintain our volumes and accommodate a lower-priced home for our customer. So, we've been working with realtors to come up with plans that actually worked for their clients, where they are engaged, and at the same time, trying to maintain and bring down the cost of the home for the customer.
Trevor Allinson: Okay. Makes a lot of sense. And then, just given where we are in the election cycle, housing has clearly gotten a lot of attention politically recently. Stuart, I think you alluded to some of the proposals on the supply side, but there's also a proposal for buyers in terms of downpayment assistance. I was hoping just to get your thoughts on the down assistance proposal. Are you still seeing down payments as a key headwind to homeownership or is it primarily DTIs? And then, what are your views on potential demand impact if that were to eventually go into place? Thanks.
Stuart Miller: Great question. Inflation has been a difficult component in enabling our customer base to accumulate a downpayment. And there's no question that the downpayment is a hurdle and has been and continues to be a hurdle for customers looking to acquire specifically a first home. Whether it's attainable housing or affordable housing, the downpayment is definitely a hurdle. I think that the -- there are a lot of thoughts and programs out there. We'll see where they shake out. I think there's a tightrope that has to be walked. Number one, we've got to remember back to the Great Recession, we certainly don't want to get to that "no downpayment" kind of programming. It might feel good for a short period of time, but we want a durable housing market. I think we also have to think about inflationary pressures, to the balance between additional supply and additional demand is something that's going to have to be walked through. What has me most invigorated is the fact that what we've been hearing from mayors and governors, and talking to mayors and governors for a very long time, is now starting to reflect in the national narrative. And the fact that the nuanced programs are not perfected yet, but the discussion is starting to activate thinking as to how do we get better and build a healthier housing market is going to inure to the benefit of our housing business.
Trevor Allinson: All right. Thank you. I appreciate your views. Good luck moving forward.
Stuart Miller: Okay. And why don't we take one more question?
Operator: Okay. And our last question comes from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open.
John Lovallo: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in here. I wanted to actually dovetail off of Trevor's question to start. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 70 basis points below the midpoint of your outlook, on a slight revenue beat versus your expectations. You talked about pulling back on brokers, but was that pullback on brokers incremental? Is that what the driver was? And the lack of broker use for -- I guess, one way to say it is, the lack of broker use relative to some of your competitors, does that mean that fewer folks are coming through your communities, and because of that, you need more incentives to drive that volume that you're looking to keep? I mean, are you taking costs out of one bucket and put it into another, is the simple way of putting it.
Stuart Miller: So, good question, and one that we think about a lot. It is counterintuitive to us that -- first of all, we have not seen a reduction in our traffic. And what we're doing is not something that's new. This is basically a program that we've had in place for a very long time relative to what we call the Machine, the digital marketing programming, and the way that we're executing our marketing and sales program. So, our realtor costs have been migrating downward. It has not been a reduction in traffic or people coming through our offices. It's counterintuitive to us that, by adding a cost, we would also be adding a pricing power. And it's probably just not the way that we think about building a healthier housing market. To the extent that a realtor is actively involved in becoming a procuring cause and finding a customer and bringing them to us, we want to pay appropriately and participate with the realtor community. On the other hand, there's an awful lot of realtor engagement that is kind of ancillary to the active engagement. We try to bleed that out of the system because we are trying to reduce cost. Are we taking it from a more active realtor engagement and putting it into incentives? I guess, I'd like to say that I think -- I hope the answer is kind of yes, but I don't think it's greater incentives outsized relative to the realtor costs that we're saving. And I'd like to think that if we're taking cost out, we're actually able to sell at a lower price and still produce a better margin. So, we're still working with that. It's a tough balance, it's a complicated balance, and it's something that we focus on, frankly, every day. And most definitely, as Jon and I go out to our operations reviews, it's something that we're very close to and watch regularly.
John Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful color. And then, the last one is, as you mentioned, REITs have to distribute the vast majority of their income to shareholders. So, I'm curious sort of what the pros and cons of a REIT structure for the spin would be. And the reason I ask is, why don't private landbank structure themselves like REITs? I mean, is this going to limit the ability to grow with Lennar if it has to distribute the earnings?
Stuart Miller: Well, as I noted, we've had to focus our discussion on -- around Millrose as it relates to the impacts on Lennar rather than the explicit discussion of how the Millrose structure will actually work. We're going to have to wait on that one, for the filing of the S-11. I think it is a unique structure. And every good book is worth waiting until the next chapter, so you're just going to have to wait for the next chapter. And I appreciate the question.
John Lovallo: All right. Thank you, guys. Good luck.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thanks very much. And as always, we appreciate everyone's attention. Thanks for joining our earnings call, and we look forward to continuing to describe, detail our progress as we move forward. We'll see you at the end of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-06-18 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for the reading of the forward-looking statement.
David Collins: Thank you and good morning, everyone.

Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption Risk Factors contained in Lennar's Annual Report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, and good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross is here, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and we have a few others as well. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon's going to give an operational overview updating construction costs, cycle time, and some other operating overview. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight along with some limited guidance for our third quarter and full-year 2024. And then, of course, we'll have our question-and-answer period. And as usual, I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as possible. But before I begin, however, I would like to express on behalf of all of the associates of Lennar the sadness we all feel for the recent loss of another pioneer of our industry, Don Horton. While we homebuilders compete, sometimes aggressively, in the field and across geographies, it is always with humble admiration and respect for our competitors. We learn from each other. We have reverence for all of their accomplishments. We learn from their successes and sometimes their failures and we are pushed to be our very best by their comparative accomplishments. This business is not easy. And those who succeed over years are to be admired. Don was a tremendous success among homebuilders. And his success spanned decades. He climbed from humble beginnings to the greatest heights within our industry. To the associates of D.R. Horton, as well as to Don Horton's family, we express our most sincere condolences. And we look forward to continuing to live, to learn, to admire, and, yes, to compete with the D.R. Horton name as you carry on Don's tremendous legacy. With that said, let me begin my remarks today. We're very pleased to report another consistent and solid quarter of operating results for Lennar. We have continued to execute our operating plan effectively throughout the first-half of 2024 as we have driven production pace and sales pace in sync, while we have used our margin as a point of adjustment to enable consistent production even as market conditions have changed. This program has driven excellent operating results to date, and we have simply never been better positioned as a company, from balance sheet to operating strategy, to execution, to be able to adjust to a changing market as it unfolds for the remainder of 2024, and beyond. In the second quarter, we started approximately 21,400 homes, we sold approximately 21,300 homes, and we delivered approximately 19,700 homes, keeping us on target to deliver approximately 80,000 homes for the year. Next quarter, we expect to start, sell, and deliver similar consistency as we continue to drive a continuously improving even-flow manufacturing model that we believe will continue to enhance our cash flow, our bottom line, as well as our predictability. We've continued to target a consistent production and growth rate in order to maintain volume, minimize production costs, maintain even-flow production and sales, all in order to drive cash flow, effective capital allocation, and higher returns. Our primary goal is to migrate to a pure play asset-light manufacturing model that will be supported by a durable, just-in-time homesite delivery program that will enable simultaneous growth and cash flow. We believe that a cash flow-enabled capital allocation strategy will drive higher shareholder returns, higher returns on assets, and ultimately higher returns on equity. As we migrate to our desired end state, margin is the springing mechanism that enables this all to happen. This quarter, our margin was somewhat higher than expected at 22.6%, up from 21.8% last quarter. Next quarter, we expect our margin to be approximately 23% depending on market conditions. And for the full-year, we remain focused on driving margins to be approximately the same as last year's full-year margin of 23.3%. While we understand that that will require a substantially higher fourth quarter margin, that accomplishment is partially embedded in our backlog, while, as I have said before, the result of that story will depend on market conditions, interest rates, and consumer confidence as we go through the remainder of the year; we will see. While we have been refining our operating platform, we've continued to drive strong cash flow, and have allocated over $600 million to repurchase approximately 3.8 million shares of stock, and additionally to repay over $550 million of senior debt as we continue to improve our balance sheet with a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of just 7.7%. While we continue to hold a sizable $3.6 billion of cash on our book, we are crafting our strategy for strategic capital allocation in pursuit of our structural objectives which I will discuss further in just a few minutes. But let me briefly address the economic environment. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains relatively constructive for homebuilders. There are challenges, and there are opportunities. The demand for housing remains strong and limited by affordability, interest rates, and sometimes labor and consumer confidence. Additionally, the chronic housing shortage driven by over a decade of underproduction of housing stock is additionally problematic for families seeking affordable or attainable supply. Demand remains robust if it can be supplied at an attainable price point with interest rate support that enables the consumer to transact. Through our second quarter, interest rate started lower and fell constructive at approximately 6.75% as the market was adjusting to a new normal. Then, through the quarter, rates began a gradual climb to 7.3% before dropping again as the quarter ended. Concurrently, consumers remained employed. They are confident that they will remain employed and they believe that their compensation will rise as well. This is most often the foundation of a very strong housing market. But the chronic supply shortage, the impact of interest rates on affordability as well as persistent and stubborn inflation has moderated housing market strength. In response, new homebuilders have worked out incentive structures that range from interest rate buy-downs, to closing cost pick-ups, to price reduction designed to meet the purchaser at their intersection of need and affordability. Those incentives have increased and decreased as interest rates have moved up and down. Home builders particularly those with strong balance sheets and ready access to capital have been able to adjust, capture demand, and drive efficiencies by using incentives to reduce the affordability constraint and enable purchasers to transact. Against this backdrop, in our second quarter we have continued to execute our core operating strategy. That strategy has been to refine a manufacturing production model that is pure-play home building and land light, asset light. And simply put, that is what we are refining. As I noted last quarter, we have been refining our manufacturing model. We have also been actively migrating to a pure-play and land light operating structure across our home building platform in each of our 40 homebuilding divisions. I will start with manufacturing. We continue to refine on manufacturing platform that has maintained production and sales base while we continue engineer our homes for efficiency and volume. Driving volume enables us to offer more attainable product. The as-needed supply to the market, we meet the needs of the consumer and we contribute to building a balance and therefore healthier housing market. In doing so, we have enhanced our inventory turn, and grown volume as we generate substantial cash flow. The consistency of our production and sales program across our platform together with constructive capital allocation enable us to simultaneously enhance shareholder returns, returns on inventory, and ultimately return on equity. Let me turn to pure-play. We are a home builder that builds affordable housing in strategic market that fill the chronic supply shortage. We will continue to reduce exposure to all non-core assets. We are intensifying our focus on producing affordable and attainable products across our platform. Land is more expensive, impact fees are getting more expensive, and labor and material cost has been rising as well. We can only reduce the cost of housing by increasing productivity through efficiencies of our operation. Our focus has been on doing just that. We are building more consistent products that we call our core products that are carefully value engineered. And, we are using our state pace to refine an engineered production cycle, enabling us to reduce cycle time and to work with our trade partners to build efficiencies in logistics and the way that we run our community production. We are building attainable homes for primary purchasers who can afford a down payment and qualify for a mortgage. And as market conditions dictate, we have and will use incentives to enable primary purchasers to purchase and achieve home ownership. We have also continued working on additional product approaches to help build a more healthy housing market. We have intensified our focus on build-to-rent, community scale, and single-family-for-rent scattered homes across markets. We believe that we can and need to build additional production for professionally owned housing that can fill an important additional need. Those professional purchasers need cost efficiencies in today's interest rate environment in order to make their rents attainable, and we can provide that. There are many families who are building their future and aspire to single-family lifestyle with backyards, schools, and parks, but who can't yet afford a down payment or don't have the credit characteristics to qualify the mortgage that they need. Institutional buyers fill that void for those families. Many have criticized the professionally owned market and the investor class that competes with primary homeowners to purchase product for rentals. This is quad thinking. We are also engaged in repurposing our blue chip multifamily platform to build attainable rental products in an off-balance sheet configuration. We will build a singular product, another core product, called our Emblem Series. It will be built by our home building division, but will be built with private equity capital. We have a strong history of successfully building multi-family products across the country. We have been building those products in an off-balance sheet configuration, and we expect to continue to build this vital, attainable product without encumbering our balance sheet. And currently, we are repatriating capital that has been deployed in prior multifamily engagements. We are under contract to sell the assets of LMV Fund 1. There are multiple buyers, and we are working through the closing process of each asset with those buyers. We expect the assets will close throughout the second-half of 2024. Also as we continue to stay laser-focused on our pure play and asset-like strategy of generating cash and increasing returns, we are regularly reviewing the best strategy for other multifamily assets that are on book, and we may decide to monetize additional assets also in the second-half of 2024. On a combined basis, these transactions could result in cash proceeds of approximately $250 million in the second-half of the year. So, let me turn to just-in-time. We have been complementing our manufacturing model with a durable, just-in-time, finished homesite delivery system. Every home that is going to be built needs a homesite with a permit, and those homesites need to be optioned and off-balance sheet until we are ready to build. We continue to focus on a just-in-time delivery program for land, just like we have for lumber and appliances, and we continue to make excellent progress in this regard. While we have always executed option land deals with third-party developers, those deals are not always available and there are no developers in many of our markets. We only become structurally and durably land-like and asset-like by both negotiating option deals with landowners and developers and also creating structured land strategies with private equity capital or permanent capital. Accordingly, we have worked with a series of private equity partners to create a homesite purchase platform where land is held and developed and ultimately delivered on a rolling option basis to the manufacturer as homes are ready to be started. This platform is a backstop for purchased land to be developed and delivered just-in-time to the manufacturer without land risk to that manufacturer. By consistently focusing on our land life strategy, we have materially enhanced and generated consistent cash flow through the ups and downs of interest rate changes, and we have enhanced our balance sheet and our liquidity. Our balance sheet, as I noted earlier, is situated with a 7.7% debt-to-capital ratio, homebuilding debt-to-capital ratio with $3.6 billion of cash on hand and $0 being drawn on our revolver. We have the flexibility to allocate capital strategically, first, of course to grow while also retiring debt, paying appropriate dividends and repurchasing shares of Lennar stock. We are aware that many have suggested that we have accumulated too much cash on our balance sheet and our leverage is very limited, which limits the ability of our returns to move higher. While we have understood the concern, we have remained patient as we have evolved not just the migration to land like configuration, but also have remained focused on the long-term durability of the structures involved. Private equity capital can be fickle. By driving volume through these programs, we have gained advantaged insights into the refined workings of our strategic land programs. Although we have a number of constructive partners in this regard, I would like to especially thank Ryan Mollett and Angelo Gordon for being an incredible and selfless partner in helping to evolve these programs over the past years. He has been truly invaluable in execution and evolution and of course, never a mercenary in any engagement. With Ryan's help, the underlying plumbing system for the land strategies have been refined and questions have been answered as to the durability of the relationships that make up the counterparty relationship with the homebuilding partner. Building on our experience, on our last earnings call, we announced that we were rekindling our focus on a strategic spin-off of most of our remaining land in order to create a permanent capital vehicle that can option developed homesites to Lennar, recycle capital into new homesites and distribute market appropriate returns to shareholders. I am pleased to inform you that we have made substantial progress over the last 90 days, and we confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the SEC a few weeks ago. We are currently looking at approximately a $6 billion to $8 billion of land that we expect to spin-off into a new public company with no associated debt. The goal of this spin-off is to accelerate our land light strategy which would allow for off balance sheet present of the land assets. We are excited about the opportunities that we believe this spin-off will bring us to the innovations that we have developed for the operation of the spun-off entity. Following the spin-off, the new public company will be completely independent from Lennar. Lennar will have option purchase agreements to purchase back finished homesites on a just-in-time basis. Our team led by Fred Rothman has been fully dedicated to bringing this project to life as soon as we can, but we are still early in the process and there is no specific timeline to completion or guarantee that the transaction will be completed. Because of the ongoing review by the SEC, we cannot comment further on the spin-off, but we look forward to providing you with an update on progress and timing in the future. After the spin-off, the new company would be another bucket of capital, in other words, additive, consistent and compatible with other relationships that have existed and will continue to thrive alongside Lennar. Such a transaction would distribute capital to shareholders, it would reduce inventory on Lennar's books and it would provide permanent dependable capital for future land options. Our balance sheet would remain very strong with consistent earnings and cash flow to continue to pay down debt and to repurchase stock. So, let me conclude and say at Lennar, we are continuing to modernize and upgrade the Lennar operating platform as we drive consistent production and sales. It has been a busy and productive quarter, and we have continued to execute in the short term while we build our platform for continued and future success. Our second quarter of 2024 has been another strategic and operational success for our company. While market conditions have remained challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across our markets. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize and if the Fed is actually going to begin to cut rates, we believe pent-up demand will be activated and we will be well prepared. If not we will continue to produce volumes and add to market supply. For that, we are well prepared. Even though higher rates have remained sticky, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Given consistent execution, we're extremely well positioned for even greater success as strong demand for affordable offerings continues to seek short supply. Perhaps most importantly, our extraordinarily strong balance sheet affords us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful innovation for our future. We will focus on our manufacturing model and continue to execute. We will focus on our pure play business model and reduce exposure to non-core assets. We will continue to drive to just-in-time homesite delivery and an asset light balance sheet, and we will continue to allocate capital to growth, debt retirement and stock repurchases as appropriate. We have the luxury to execute flawlessly in the short term, while we continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and stock buyback, while we also and I emphasize also pursued strategic distribution to shareholders that fortifies our future. We have clearly earned an enviable position. As I look forward to a successful 2024, we are well positioned and expect to see much more of the same. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, perform and drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance. We are guiding to 20,500 to 21,000 closings next quarter with approximately a 23% margin, and we do expect to deliver approximately 80,000 homes this year with a little over a 23% margin. We also expect to repurchase in excess of $2 billion of stock in 2024 as we continue to drive very strong cash flow. We look forward to a very strong year and for that, I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus, effort and talent. And with that, let me turn over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Good morning. As you heard from Stuart, our operational teams at Lennar continue to refine and improve upon the execution of our core operating strategies. Each quarter, our divisions further refined elements of these strategies and how they can more effectively work in concert. We are laser focused on creating an even flow production first homebuilder designed to deliver maximum results. As part of this process, Stuart, myself and our Regional Presidents travel to our divisions meeting with their management teams after the close of each quarter to review each of the elements of our operating strategy. In fact, we're in the middle of these reviews right now, taking today off of course to address our earnings, but back at it tomorrow. In these meetings, we learn together what is working and what needs improvement. With the end goal in mind of even flow production, we have built a strong sense of confidence in the liability and results driven by selling the right homes at the right price. Every day our divisions learn from their engagement within our machine constantly adjusting and trying new tactics. The machine produces information in the form of dashboards for analysis and decision making. There is a continuous feedback loop as leads move from the top of the funnel, through the funnel and ultimately to a sale. This review enables lower customer acquisition costs while also improving the customer experience. Again, this quarter our operating results produced starts that were evenly matched with sales and are projected to be evenly matched again in the third quarter. We will continue to refine this process of matching sales and production pace production, which provides maximum benefit to our supply chain and our trade partners. Last quarter, I described to you how our divisions hold machine learning meetings to optimize the selling of the right homes at the right price based on the prior week's activities. Our operating teams review dashboards comparing actual results to the planned activity and make adjustments in real time to marketing plans for the upcoming week. Currently, these meetings are focused on how to cost effectively grab higher quality leads, what we refer to as less hay and more needles. In turn, this reduces the overall number of leads we interact with delivering more higher quality leads to our team. These improvements will result in a better customer experience, higher conversion rates and lower customer acquisition costs. In our second quarter, as interest rates fluctuated around 7%, this process informed us as to where we have pricing power or where we need the buy down of interest rates and or other incentives to achieve the desired pace. Delivering pace resulted or achieving the pace resulted in ending the quarter with an average of less than one unsold completed home per community and enabled our growth of 19% in sales and 15% in deliveries year-over-year. Our sales pace of 5.7 homes per community in Q2 is up from the pace of 4.8 last year. This increase was by design the match to start pace of 5.8 homes per community in Q2. To match sales pace to production pace means the sales pace we achieved varied across our markets. We're able to flex sales pace faster or slower as needed in order to match production on a community-by-community basis. Next, I'll discuss cycle time and construction costs. As I mentioned, by continuously improving the way we execute this game plan of predictable and reliable production, we deepen the partnerships with our trade partners. We focus on maintaining both a high volume and importantly a consistent volume of homes under construction that allows our trade partners to reduce their input costs despite the inflationary macro environment. This strategy along with value engineering and SKU rationalization produces many efficiencies benefiting our trade partners. By consistently starting homes, EMS interest rates rose during the quarter. We increased our starts by 9% from the prior year and 78% sequentially from Q1. For the second quarter, cycle time decreased by four days sequentially from Q1 down to 150 days on average for single family homes, a 30% decrease year-over-year. We expect to see cycle time continue to improve as we become increasingly more efficient. Looking at the second quarter, as expected, our construction costs also decreased sequentially from Q1 by about 1% and on a year-over-year basis by about 9%. Moving forward, to drive further efficiencies and cost reductions, we are making significant progress on utilizing highly valued engineered home plans, which as Stuart mentioned, we call it core product strategy. These are our first starts with these homes in Texas late in the second quarter and we'll see expanded start throughout Texas and Florida in the third quarter with first deliveries in our fourth quarter. The initial success of these core plans is seen as we engage with our trade partners and believe this will improve upon our position as a builder of choice. The reduced cost and time to build these core plans will help us achieve the goal of delivering more attainable housing to meet the needs of the home buying consumer. Next, I'll discuss our land light strategy. In the second quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners with a purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time homesites to our homebuilding machine. In the second quarter, about 90% of our $1.7 billion or approximately 16,000 homesites acquired in the quarter were finished homesites purchased from these various land structures. This drove further progress in the quarter of our supply of owned homesites has improved to 1.2 years down from 1.7 years and control homesites percentage increased to 79% from 70% year-over-year. These improvements in the execution of our operating strategies resulting in reduced cycle time and less land owned has increased our cash flow as well as improved our inventory churn, which now stands at 1.6 versus 1.3 last year, a 23% increase. The second quarter demonstrated ongoing progress and the execution of each of the strategies Stuart and I have reviewed. We started with a focus on what our marketing and sales machine then to our production and on to land strategies. We focus on improving and connecting these strategies together driving even more consistency and improvement. Refining these strategies means that change is constant, and the focus and hard work to execute is consistent. Yes, change can be challenging, but our associates are leaning into each of these strategies, embracing the challenges, and are executing at even higher levels. I also want to thank our associates for their commitment to this effort. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our home building performance. So, therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations, summarize our balance sheet highlights, and then provide estimates for Tier 3. So, starting with financial services, for the second quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of $146 million. The strong earnings were primarily driven by an increase in homebuilding volume and a higher capture rate. Additionally, there is a constant drumbeat to embrace technology to continue to find ways to run a more efficient business. Our financial services team is intensely dedicated to providing a great customer experience for each home buyer and has created true partnerships with our homebuilding teams to best accomplish that goal. That partnership is clearly reflected in their solid results. So, now turning to our balance sheet, this quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market with the goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The results of these actions were that we ended the quarter with $3.6 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.2 billion revolving credit facility. This provided total liquidity of $5.8 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investments, we once again made significant progress on our goal of becoming land light. At quarter-end, as Jon indicated, our years owned improved to 1.2 years from 1.7 years in the prior year, and our homesites controlled increased to 79% from 70% in the prior year, our lowest years owned and highest controlled percentage in our history. At quarter-end, we owned 91,000 homesites and controlled 340,000 homesites for a total of 431,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to gain market share in a capital-efficient way. We spent $1.7 billion on land purchases this quarter. However, about 90% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just-in-time basis, which is less capital intensive. Of the homes closed during the quarter, about 60% were from our third-party land structures where we purchased the homesites on a finished basis. As we continue to reduce our ownership of land and purchase homesites on a just-in-time basis, our earnings should more consistently approximate cash flow. And over time, it would be our goal to align capital return to shareholders more closely with that cash flow. And finally, our inventory return was 1.6 times, up from 1.7 times last year, and our return on inventory was 31.4%, up 110 basis points from last year. During the quarter, and consistent with our production focus, we started about 21,400 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 40,000 homes in inventory, excluding models. This inventory number included about 1,100 homes that were completed unsold, which is less than one home per community, as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. And looking at our debt maturity profile, we repaid $454 million of our 4.5% senior notes due April 2024, and we repurchased in the open market $100 million of senior notes due November 2027 at an average price of $98.6. Our next debt maturity is not until May of 2025. We continue to benefit from our previous paydowns of senior notes and strong earnings generation, which brought our homebuilding debts total cap down to 7.7% at quarter-end, our lowest ever, and a remarkable improvement from 13.3% in the prior year. Consistent with our commitment to increasing shareholder returns, we repurchased 3.8 million of our outstanding shares versus 603 million. Additionally, we paid total dividends this quarter of $139 million. And just a few final points on our balance sheet, our stockholders' equity increased to almost $27 billion and our book value per share increased to $97.88. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity, and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through 2024, and beyond. And so, with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q3 and provide some guidance estimates. We expect Q3's new orders to be in the range of 20,500 to 21,000 homes as we continue to sell homes in line with our production pace. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to also be in the range of 20,500 to 21,000 homes with the manufacturing focus of efficiently turning inventory into cash. Our Q3 average sales price on those deliveries should be in the range of $420,000 to $425,000. And we expect gross margins to be about 23%, and our SG&A to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.5% with both estimates having some plus or minus depending on market conditions. For the combined Homebuilding joint venture, land sales, and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $20 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q3 to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million based on expected product mix in our mortgage operations. We expect a loss of about $20 million for our Multifamily business, and this estimate does not include the impact of the multifamily transactions that Stuart outlined in his narrative since the specific timing is still uncertain. And then, turning to Lennar Other, we expect a loss of about $25 million for this category. This estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustment for a public technology investment since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. Our Q3 corporate G&A should be about 1.8% of total revenues. And our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to about 24.25%, and the weighted average share count should be about 271 million shares. And so, on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.50 to $3.65 per share for the quarter. For the full-year, as we mentioned, we remain focused on delivering 80,000 homes, which would be a 10% growth year-over-year, with a gross margin that is consistent with last year's gross margin. We also remain confident with our cash flow generation. As such, we are still targeting a total capital allocation of at least $2.5 billion for 2024. $1.7 billion has already been utilized to repurchase shares and reduce our debt levels through Q2. And so, the balance will be applied to additional share repurchases in the second-half of the year. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate all the color and solid results in the quarter. Wanted to first start with the land asset structures that you're envisioning, particularly the spin, I know you said that there's going to be more information provided at a later date. But that you did offer up that it would have about $6 billion to $8 billion of land. That's higher than, I think, that you previously envisioned. I think you said it would have no debt; the team would be led by Fred Rothman. And so, just taking some of those, I'm curious what additional land assets are now being included versus what you previously thought? When you say the spin will have no debt, do you mean on a standalone basis it will operate with no debt? And if so, are you going to feed the entity with cash, do you think? And then, lastly, is the entity going to be staffed by current Lennar employees or primarily industry external personnel?
Stuart Miller: So, that's a bundle of questions in one question, Steve. We see you. So, as noted, we're fairly limited in what we can talk about. Just for clarification, it's being spun with no debt. We do have land assets on our books, and have continued to, as we have evolved our thinking and structuring of the spun entity, as I noted, we had stood up a [straw-man] (ph) with a $4 billion number. As we refined our thinking, we've just included more of the assets that we have. Giving more detail than that would be outside of the boundaries. What I noted about Fred is that he has been leading the effort to build the filings that were filed with the SEC. And we haven't gone beyond that to talk about the population of the spun asset. That is something that we'll discuss at some future date. It was more to highlight that we have a dedicated team that is very focused on the execution of the program that we are putting forth, and there will be more detail as we report in future.
Stephen Kim: Okay, so I guess we're going to -- that's fine, I guess we're just going to have to wait for more info. That's fine.
Stuart Miller: That's correct.
Stephen Kim: The second question I have relates to your gross margin. I think you alluded to the curiosity that people have about the guide seeming to imply something around 25% or something in 4Q. I'm hoping you can talk about what gives you confidence that the 4Q gross margin will rise? And in particular, I know that you have talked about your even-flow production schedule perhaps affecting the seasonal cadence of gross margin. So, maybe I can ask the question this way. If, hypothetically, market conditions were to be stable for like a whole year, how much seasonal variance would you generally expect by quarter? Would it be that your fourth quarter would generally have the highest margin with a consistent set of market conditions? And help us think through the quarterly cadence, if you could?
Stuart Miller: Well, first, let me say that we've been clear that we are migrating to a much more even-flow model, and that would take some of the seasonality out of the margin variance that has been historic and has been seasonal, but some of it. Some of it just tends to ebb and flow, along with market conditions during different seasons of the year. We do understand that margins will be materially higher in the fourth quarter, some of that is seasonal. Some of that has been directional in terms of the work that we've done on building both core plans and reducing our construction costs as we have continued to build volume and continued to consistently address a somewhat volatile market. We have earned not only the respect, but cooperation of our trade partners in understanding that they can depend on production. And we have used that cooperation to be able to build a more efficient program. It takes you time for some rate savings to flow through. We do have visibility as to what those savings are and how they're flowing through. And as I said, some of that includes and in margin is embedded in our backlog. Of course, as the market ebbs and flows, some of it driven by interest rate, some by consumer confidence, we'll have to see how shelves and pricing resolve as we go through the remainder of the year, and we leave that open. And we'll see that together as market conditions present. And Diane, anything you'd like to add to that?
Diane Bessette: Yes, just the other thing is, as you know, the expense -- field expense, so that in and of itself, generally, if you look back last year, for example, from Q3 to Q4, we had about a 40 basis point benefit just from the field. So, that 40-50 basis points is pretty consistent lift that we get from Q3 to Q4 just from field expenses.
Stephen Kim: Okay, great, that's helpful. So, just to make sure I understand, if it sounds like that the seasonal aspects, which might be the field expenses, is a fairly minor benefit to your 4Q. And so, it sounds like you're attributing more of the stronger 4Q gross margin to actually your scale advantages that you've been building up. That sounds like something that's more persistent and not necessarily something that is particular to a fourth quarter per se, right? And so this sort of gives us a thought process that your margins are generally improving as you've been improving your scale. And that's the message that we should take back for this 4Q lift in gross margin?
Stuart Miller: I think that's a good takeaway. And I think that in many ways, this is structural and durable for the future. So, a lot of what we've been doing on the one hand has been muted by the fact that market conditions have moved around quite a bit, as I noted, interest rates moving up through this last quarter tested edges. But on the other hand, the cost savings and the way that we are, number one, configuring production in the field, and number two, re-engineering our product lines to be much more consistent with core products that are repeatable from market to market and across individual markets is creating a durable efficiency that will be with us for years to come. So, yes, I think that this will be sticky and stay with us as we move forward.
Stephen Kim: Perfect. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate all the help.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Jon, you mentioned differentiating among markets that pricing power versus the need to increase incentives. Can you talk a bit about what those markets are or were in second quarter? And then in particular, I'm interested in Florida with the existing home inventory higher, some evidence of vacant capacity from the rental market coming back to for sale, second homes. Can you talk maybe specifically about those metros too? Thanks.
Jon Jaffe: Sure, as we saw in most of Florida markets continued strength, particularly from southeast Florida up the eastern coast of Florida. We saw very strong year-over-year growth in our pace, which indicates that the other panes of the market demand are there. I would say we saw more of a return to seasonality in southwest Florida this year. So, she strengthened that market, but definitely saw that occur. Saw real strength up through the Carolinas, Atlanta, and up into the mid-Atlantic. And then, in Texas saw the ability to continue at a pace that the matchup production which is again supported by the underlying demand. And our west, strength was seen in some of the mountain areas in Denver and Salt Lake City and then out in California really led by the affordability and the Empire and just ongoing supply demand and balance in the Bay Area.
Carl Reichardt: Thank you for that, Jon. And then, I have sort of a broader question. As you at Lennar and some others have kind of transitioned away from, I guess, what you could call a land speculation type of business model years ago to more of a vertically integrated manufacturer, retailer, building more spec, pricing more aggressively. Stuart, do you think the consumer is becoming conditioned to expect discounts in the market, especially seasonal ones, the same way we've seen it in other sort of big ticket retail businesses? And I ask in part because pricing and changing in base pricing has been a bit of an issue in this business given that homes are also investments as opposed to simply consumer products and so stability in price is of value to some degree. So, maybe you can talk about how the consumers responding or might respond in the long run if their views are changing on when they buy [technical difficulty] --
Stuart Miller: There is a supply shortage. But on the other hand, the consumer out of necessity is looking for elements of incentives or discounts to be able to afford, to be able to access the housing stock that they need. I don't think that we can draw long-term conclusions about discounting from this moment in time. And I think it's very differentiated from the broader retail world in that we have a structural and chronic supply shortage. There will be a moment in time where affordability is less challenged. At that moment in time, the supply shortage will be a more dominant theme. And I think you'll more quickly see a snap back to where demand will come to market, outstrip the supply, and some of the discounting, a lot of the discounting will kind of snap back to normal levels. So, I think it would be overly aggressive to try to draw a conclusion just to the way the market will evolve in the future from today's current configuration.
Carl Reichardt: I appreciate your thoughts. Thanks, Stuart. Thanks all.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to focus a bit on the cash flows and thinking about the capital allocation. You know, Stuart, in the past you've mentioned getting net income and free cash flow closer to being in line together. As you think about a lot of the initiatives that you're putting in place and the progress you're making there, can you talk about how far out you think you are from achieving that and what are the roadblocks that perhaps still exist to getting there?
Stuart Miller: I'll pass back to Diane for a second. Go ahead.
Diane Bessette: I'll jump in. I think with each quarter that goes by, we're getting closer to closer and sometimes we exceed. You know, if you look at this quarter, for example, in that area, let's just call it $950 million. And our capital allocation, when you combine the share purchases and the debt paydowns was in excess of that, right, at about $1.1 billion. So, it actually flows a little bit. Sometimes it's a little short, and sometimes it's a little over. But I think the important thing is that as we continue to really focus on being the manufacturer and have even flow really become even more prominent in our business and purchasing on a just-in-time basis, I think you're going to see those two much more consistently aligned.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. And then, as you do think about the business further out and, you know, as I said, the initiatives that you're going through, what is the level of cash balance that you will eventually feel comfortable holding on the balance sheet? How much will you need to sort of maintain the business? And how do you think about the allocation of the amount that comes in above that level?
Stuart Miller: It's a fair question. It's a good question and I think that we are not quite there in being able to project out exactly how to think about that. As we go through and have gone through some of the reconfigurations, we have been -- I want to say surprised, but surprised is too aggressive a word. To the upside and to the downside as to exactly how cash flows from quarter-to-quarter through the year, and the answer to your question is going to be directly tied to how our cash edge and flows as bricks and bricks flow through the operational manufacturing machine that we have. I think that we are leaving ourselves some latitude to develop some real-time understanding and expertise in how those dollars will flow in and out. And that's why we've been a little stubborn on using our cash a little bit more aggressively, particularly as we craft the spin company, it adds complication to some of these calculations and these structural changes make it a little bit complicated. Diane, do you want to add to that?
Diane Bessette: Yes, the only other thing I'd say that's really just in support of that is if you look at the statistic that I mentioned, which is when you look at the deliveries this quarter, 60% of the deliveries had homes that were purchased on a finished basis. And so, as I think as we see that migrate higher, that does get us to a more consistent, predictable, and visible cash flow. And then, when we get to that point, I think we can really start to have a conversation about what's that balance because that consistency and visibility has now you know come into more focus.
Susan Maklari: Yes. Okay. Thank you for those thoughts. I appreciate it. Good luck with everything.
Stuart Miller: Susan, let me just say one more thing. There's another element and that is appropriate capital for growth. So, it's something, it's another part of the equation. We remain growth minded, as we build structures for the future. So, that's another variable that goes into that question about how much cash do we retain. Just finishing up --
Susan Maklari: Okay. No, that makes sense. Yes. No, that makes sense, Stuart. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Nice quarter and congrats on all the behind the scenes work on pivoting towards just-in-time. I think it's going to be exciting to see it all done in the quarters and years ahead. Stuart, first question, last quarter, you guys kind of referenced a little bit of, I guess a weakening in the overall quality, the credit quality of the consumers you were seeing by the potential buyers in your community is maybe some higher credit card debt, lower credit scores. And I think at the time, you were kind of the first to kind of address that and we've since heard some more anecdotes about that, both from homebuilders as well as other industries. So, just curious my first question, what you are seeing from the consumer today? Are you seeing more kind of yellow flags or red flags unfolding? Or have things been pretty stable since then?
Stuart Miller: Yes. Thanks, Alan. You're right. We did detail that in the last quarterly call. I felt it was important to put out there at the time. Since that time, it has been much better documented. And so, I think it's fairly well known, but there has been some movement upward in consumer debt, the debt of some of our customers. It has not spiked, shrink spend. It has not changed materially to the negative. But there's no question that given inflation rates and the cost of living expenses, the consumer is definitely feeling a little bit more stressed and we are starting to see a little bit more credit challenge as customers come through, but that's consistent with what we were seeing last quarter. And of course that makes the interest rate movement all the more, it creates more sensitivity. So, as interest rates have started to subside a little bit, it will be interesting to see how that ripples with the current state of the consumer and we're looking forward to addressing market conditions as they present.
Alan Ratner: Great. I appreciate that update on that and encouraging to hear at least it's not accelerating or the deterioration is not getting worse. Second, I'd love to spend a minute just talking about the SG&A and the corporate expense line because I think that was the one area on the model that maybe was a little bit worse than guided for. And I think in general, it's been trending higher than a year ago. And I know there's a lot that could potentially be driving that. Obviously, broker commissions and things like that could be a function of where demand is. But I know you've got a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes as well with SpinCo and Apartments. And I was hoping you could just spend a minute or two talking about what's going on with the SG&A, where you see that going forward beyond the third quarter and kind of pick apart the pluses and minuses there?
Stuart Miller: Yes. We probably didn't spend enough time on SG&A. I thought about that as I was writing my remarks. SG&A is not the tight programming that we've had historically, it's simply because we are working on so much and recalibrating the way that the business actually operates. And if you think about the fact that over the past few years, we've probably migrated about $20 billion of land to off balance sheet kind of programming in favor of adjusting time delivery system. And the development of that delivery system in and of itself is a reorganization of the entire platform and comes with some cost ebbs and flows that are flowing through SG&A. And in particular, as we now start building an additional subsidiary kind of program in that regard, meaning the some of a large part of the other land that we own and building this SpinCo, you can imagine that some of the ebbs and flows of SG&A will be altered from its normal course by some kind of anomalous additions that are flowing through. So, Diane, maybe you can give a little bit more color on that.
Diane Bessette: Yes. I think that's right. I think you've seen the incredible progress and transformation of our balance sheet with regard to the year zone and the percent of land that we control. And so, therefore, there has been more expenses with those transactions to accomplish that greater base. So, I think that's a little more color that corresponds with what Stuart was mentioning. Also, I think additionally, just remember that, and I know everybody's experiencing this, but insurance costs have gone up. So, as we think about our insurance policies and our deductibles and things like that, there's a little bit of that, also incredibly focused on generating non-brokered leads. And so, sometimes depending on market conditions, that requires a little bit more digital marketing and advertising spend. So, those all came together. The one thing I would note though is that the increase was not related to higher broker spend. We've been really focused on keeping that at lower level. So, however the offset to that is perhaps a little bit more digital spend so that you are creating those non-brokered deals.
Stuart Miller: Yes. Look, I just got to add to this and say that, I think we can't really break it down and compartmentalize the costs that are flowing through. It's a little bit of a jumbled picture. So, if you look at the base operation in every part of our operation from construction costs and all the way through SG&A, we are getting more and more efficient. And as we go through these next quarters, there will be a little bit of cloudiness in some of that. But as we break through to the other side, we think we're building a much better efficiency model that is going to work much better in terms of capital deployment, capital positioning and capital allocation that will work through the long-term benefit of the company.
Diane Bessette: Yes. I think as I think about it, as we talk about the benefits that the operational benefits from maintaining production in ebb and flow. The same relates to this as we continue to maintain the levels of off balance sheet transactions to generate the cash flow and the returns that it has been. We will also become more efficient with managing those costs.
Alan Ratner: Understood. I appreciate you running through all of that detail. So, thanks a lot, guys.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Rehaut: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to just circle back to covered a lot of ground and obviously appreciate all the detail, just wanted to circle back if I could try and get a little more clarity on the 4Q gross margins. And appreciate your comments earlier, Diane, around the 40 or 50 bps of kind of operational leverage. Just want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. I believe earlier, Stuart, you said that it was in part based on backlog, part based on what you expect to do, market conditions, et cetera. On the point of backlog versus market conditions, just kind of curious on if that 25 percentage type gross margin, if that is in fact what you're seeing in a part of your backlog today because obviously part of that backlog would be delivered in the upcoming quarter at 23% gross margins. How much of the 25% is based off of the backlog versus perhaps as rates have come down over the last month, we're also thinking that maybe there's a little less incentives out there today and wondering about current orders, if that's also kind of a better margin today and I don't know if mix is a part of it as well, but just trying to get a little more granular on the drivers of that 4Q improvement versus 3Q?
Stuart Miller: Good morning, Mike. Thanks for the question. So, this is an imperfect calculation. It is always imperfect to flow through production cost reductions. And so, giving more detail is a little bit complicated. Some of that and some of the higher margins will flow through our third quarter. Some of it will flow through the fourth quarter and some into the next year. It's hard to know exactly where those numbers will flow through. And so, there's not a lot more detail that we can give. It's just that directionally; we understand margin is in part driven by the price that we get for home. It's in part driven by the cost we pay for the building of that home. As we have been focusing on volume at a time where there is variability in the marketplace, we've been able to rethink not only our product lines and our core products, but also the cost structure that we work with our trade partners. And so, it's in part flowing through the revenue side, in part flowing through the cost side of the equation and we're going to see how that evolves as we go through. And while all of that is happening, we are still continuing to sell homes in the current market conditions as it ebbs and flows. So, it's a little hard to put the pieces together, but those are the pieces that we see coming together as we give guidance and as we try to do the best we can to tell you what we see ahead. Of course, the part that is in backlog, we understand components of it, but we're not sure of which homes will close in the third and the fourth quarter and into the first. And as for the homes that we will sell over the next months, we're going to have to wait and see how the market evolves in a volatile market condition as we've been there. I don't know if that's helpful, but I wish I can give it to you in more granular form.
Michael Rehaut: Yes. No, no. Yes.
Diane Bessette: The first one, I think you alluded to is incentives and as you think about the continual increase for most, in interest rates for most of Q2, of course, that impacts the closings in Q3, and so, if we see some stability, and then we don't have a crystal ball on that, but if we see some stability with rates instead of the increase that we saw last quarter, that will also be helpful to margins. So, what we saw in Q3, of course, we delivered in Q4.
Michael Rehaut: Right. No, no, no. Thank you for that, Diane. Maybe my second question, I just wanted to focus on more maybe kind of month-to-month trends and you kind of alluded to this earlier that earlier in the quarter you were dealing with a little bit of higher rates, perhaps using more incentives. Just wanted to get a sense and then obviously more recently rates coming in a little bit. Just wanted to try to get a sense if possible around how that impacted incentives as a percent of sales throughout the quarter and if there was a high watermark perhaps earlier in the quarter and just trying to get a sense of where you might be relative to that higher watermark, let's say, a couple of months ago in terms of trying to gauge pricing power and level of incentives in the marketplace today versus in rates where 30, 40 bps higher, let's say?
Stuart Miller: Well, let me start and maybe Diane will give us some additional color. But remember, as I said in my remarks, that when we started the quarter, the rates were at about six and three quarters. As we went through the quarter, it migrated up to about 7.3%. It wasn't really until right at the end of our quarter that interest rates kind of took a sudden turn in the opposite direction. So, that didn't really reflect itself through our quarter, certainly not in any of the deliveries in our quarter. So, what we have found is that the current market condition is pretty sensitive to interest rate movements. And there is a relationship and a very direct one between interest rates migrating higher and the need for higher incentives to offset some of those interest rates, it became a little more difficult as interest rates migrated to the 7.3% kind of range and there were higher incentives that went along with interest rates at that level. And I think that that's something that we can kind of expect is going to continue as rates trend up. There will be a little bit more incentive as rates trend down. It seems that some of the incentives come off. And we'll have to see if that continues to hold up, continues to be the consistent pattern. And order of magnitude, it's an everyday kind of assessment that moves around a little bit. I don't think I can peg for you that 25 basis points in interest rate translate into X number of incentive dollars spent in one area or another. It's very market-by-market, and the consumer base is very different in different markets. Diane, any --
Diane Bessette: Yes, I think that's right. I think, and to answer your question like so, is we looked at the incentives given in March, April, and May. Each month, those incentives as a percent did increase, which is very consistent with what Stuart said. It really mirrored the direction of interest rates. So, as they've moderated, it would be our hope that the levels that we saw in May would also moderate.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thanks, Mike. And let's take one more question, please.
Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Kenneth Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Zener: Hello, everybody. Well, I think we could avoid a lot of the gross margin comments if one Q perhaps is just the bottom in gross margin versus the flat math we're doing. But I want to focus on gross margin seasonality separate from the fixed yield cost, because that's kind of straightforward to model. Now, your incentives in 1Q are like 10.4, great disclosure in your Q. What was it in 2Q versus the kind of 5 to 6 level in '18-'19. And I'm asking because it seems even flow, your model, which helps obviously cost, creates a little incentive seasonality, which I think separate from the macro and the rates, because when you build a house, first-half less sales demand, so it's kind of like selling ice in the winter versus the second-half, I believe, is your thinking based on past trends. And if you can kind of talk about that, at least, I think that's what's missing in the even flow discussion a little bit, if you would. That was my first question.
Diane Bessette: So, Ken, you were asking specifically about the incentives on deliveries. Is that what you're referring to?
Kenneth Zener: Yes, yes.
Diane Bessette: So Q1, they were 3.9%. Q2, they were 9.4%. And then, of course, perhaps in seasonality, but I really, as we've been saying, I really think it's more a direct correlation, a more direct correlation to the interest rate environment. I think that perhaps what you're really referring to on a broader base, so as it's trying to punctuate that the gross margin on a go-forwarded basis should be more aligned with the changes that we've been talking about from an operational standpoint. So, the sustainability and the durability of the efficiencies and the cost benefits that we're seeing in margin should be maintained on a quarter-to-quarter basis with a little bit of seasonality mixed in, but you should see a very strong and sustainable gross margin as we become even more proficient with even soil. I think that's what you're probably trying to punctuate, so that sometimes there'll be some fluctuations in margin relative to the environment, but there's a lot of durability and sustainability in what you're seeing.
Kenneth Zener: Good. Second question, I guess, Stuart, this is a little more for you in the sense of your -- it's comparing ROI of your core homebuilding, which you're directionally going towards. Timing is as much tied to unknown things, right? And no need to get into that. But your choice to have so many other assets, which are a third or 40% of your total asset base, how do you think of your ROI goes from 30% down to ROA kind of in the low teens there, but how is multifamily, I know that land will improve your home building returns, but do you really need, like the multifamily? Is technology part of that core homebuilding, in your opinion? I'm just trying to see how philosophically you think about these other assets. I realize we can't address the timing, but that's like the biggest drag merging your ROI and your ROA. And I'm just seeing if we really need these other parts in your longer term philosophy as it's not clear to me yet. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Well, again, we are focused on being the greatest homebuilder that we can be and doing our part building a healthier housing market. The multi-family programming that we have in place is really quite adjacent to our core homebuilding business. We basically already build the same product, but the uncore product represents for a for-sale market. Building it for for-rent market is something that we can do at the division level because there is an adjacency to what we already build. And will build it in a third-party platform. So, we don't think that that will be impactful overall in term to ROI or ROA or any of those calculations. In terms of technology, technology is a small component of the overall. It's a very important component of how we are building our business. Every element of our business is being modified, reengineered, rethought in and around technology and the way that we actually -- in the way that we actually operate. From our machine, which we have talked about quite a bit, digital marketing, to dynamic pricing and everything in between that machine has been a game-changer. And the way it has been informed by the technology investments and engagements that we have worked through over these past years. The constant flow of technology, imagination, and innovation through our company is going to keep us modern and relevant as we continue to be a better version of ourselves. So, we will continue to be engaged with technology programming as we go forward. But many of the asset-heavy kinds of investments that has been part of our engagement in the past, those will be recalibrated out of the company and will be focused on things that are direct adjacencies to what we do. And that is to build affordable housing and fill the supply deficit that exists across the country.
Diane Bessette: Yes, and Kenneth, obviously those are same for having material impact not only to ROI, but ROE. So, we are very focused on that. And just going on to comment on what percentage, I don't know it is of importance to us because the business is adjacent to our core business. But in our call Stuart mentioned that we were doing in a very capital efficient way using third-party capital. So, we feel that it's a complementary business being funded in a very capital efficient way notwithstanding that we are monetizing the frontline assets. And as Stuart mentioned, we are constantly looking at other assets. So, it's an enormous focus on the company and I think that's the improvement on a go-forward basis.
Kenneth Zener: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: So, thank you, Ken, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to continuing to deliver and provide you further information on our progress as we move forward and build the best version of our company as we go forward. So, thank you for joining. And, we will see you next time.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect. And, please enjoy the rest of your day.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman and Co-CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. I'm in Miami today, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services and a few others are here with us as well. And as usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview, updating construction cost, cycle time and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight along with some limited guidance for the second quarter and full year 2024. And then, of course, we'll have our Q&A session. As usual I'd like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so that we can accommodate as many as possible. So let's go ahead and begin. We're very pleased to report another very solid and consistent quarter of operating results for Lennar. We've continued to execute our operating plan effectively into the first quarter driving excellent operating results, and we have simply never been better positioned from balance sheet to execution to operating strategy to address market conditions as they unfold for the remainder of 2024 and beyond. In the first quarter, we started 18,338 homes, we sold 18,176 homes, and we delivered 16,798 homes. While we expect deliveries for the year to be approximately 10% higher than last year at 80,000 homes. Next quarter, we expect to start approximately 21,000 homes, sell approximately 21,000 homes and deliver between 19,000 to 19,500 homes. Admittedly, we aren't quite there yet, but we are getting closer and closer to an even flow manufacturing model that we believe will continue to enhance our cash flow, our bottom line as well as our predictability. Last year, we grew at a 10% pace in a very difficult year, and we believe we'll grow at a 10% pace again this year in a complicated economic conditions. And it is being done by a carefully designed program to maintain volume, maximize efficiencies and cost reductions around production, maintaining even flow of production and sales and rebuild our asset base and balance sheet in order to drive cash flow, effective capital allocation and higher returns. That is total shareholder returns, returns on assets and returns on equity. I know I didn't mention margin yet. That's because, as I've said before, margin is the springing mechanism that enables all of this to happen. This quarter, our margin was 21.8%, somewhat higher than expected. And next quarter, we expect our margin to be approximately 22.5%, depending on market conditions. And for the full year, we expect margin to be approximately the same as last year's full year margin of 23.3%, but that, of course, will depend on market conditions as well, we will see. Additionally, we've continued to drive strong cash flow and allocate over $500 million to repurchase 3.4 million shares of stock and improve our balance sheet with a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of under 10%. While we know we have accumulated a sizable $5 billion of cash on our book, we are crafting our strategy for appropriate capital allocation. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains relatively strong for the new homebuilders. The general theme remains primarily focused around very strong demand for housing, limited by the chronic housing shortage that is particularly problematic for working class families, and their ability to find affordable or attainable supply. Demand for that product remains robust if it can be built at an attainable price point. The economic environment driving demand has been relatively favorable, supported by low unemployment and fairly strong consumer confidence. Generally speaking, consumers remain employed. They are confident that they will remain employed and they believe that their compensation is likely to rise. This is most often the foundation of a very strong housing market. Along with the supply shortage, the additional limiting factor continues to center around affordability driven by the impact of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation. With higher interest rates, affordability continues to be tested as higher monthly payments make qualifying for a loan increasingly difficult. At the same time, inflationary pressures have driven traditional cost of living expenses higher over the past two years, which has made savings for a down payment increasingly difficult. Higher prices have also started to lead to increased personal and credit card debt as families stretch to pay their bills. We've started to see early evidence of debt delinquencies showing up and derailing some mortgage applications. While interest rates have continued to move higher and lower, as the Fed continues to seek economic data indicating that inflation has been controlled, the consumer has been navigating an affordability gauntlet. The new homebuilders have worked out a variety of incentive structures that range from interest rate buy downs, to closing cost pickups, to price reductions, all designed to meet the purchaser at the intersection of need and affordability. Those incentives have increased and decreased as interest rates have moved up and down, homebuilders have been uniquely able to capture demand by using these incentives to unlock the affordability constraints and enable purchasers to transact. Against this backdrop in our first quarter we've been focused on and consistent in executing our core operating strategies. We continue to migrate to a pure-play manufacturing model across our homebuilding platform and each of our 40 homebuilding divisions in order to reduce production costs while we generate consistent cash flow. Additionally, we are reengineering our products for efficiency and volume in order to enhance our inventory turn and grow volume to contribute to build a balanced and therefore a healthier overall housing market. We have also continued to migrate to a land light balance sheet while we grow our business and expand market share in order to drive total shareholder return, return on inventory and return on equity. We are, so to speak, continuing to modernize and upgrade the Lennar airplane while we are flying the plane and putting execution and safety first as we fly. It has been a busy and productive quarter for Lennar and we've continued to execute in the short term while we continue to build our platform for continued and future success. So, let me break some of this down. On the operational side, we are running under a by design operational model, where we are starting homes at a pace designed to increase market share, while we maximize logistics and efficiencies in order to benefit from reduced construction costs. Our trade partners are given visibility on starts and timing expectations so that they can be more efficient and help pass efficiency savings on to our customers through more affordable product. By driving volume, we gained market share in most of our core markets, as we lean in when others pull back. Our trade partners see a consistent and dependable partner that is worthy of the designation of builder of choice. We work side by side with our trade partners, while we attract additional trade partner relationships. Participants find that they have dependable and consistent work with our production strategy, which leads to higher productivity and therefore, cost savings. Through market share growth in local markets, we enhanced the ability to better manage our costs, enhance our efficiency of operations, reduce cycle times with efficient production templates and enhance our inventory turn. Jon will discuss this in more detail in just a few minutes. Driving our confidence to start homes at pace in order to achieve maximum efficiency in the field is the Lennar Machine. The Machine is a combined program of digital marketing, sales consultant engagement and dynamic pricing. We've described the machine in prior calls, and many of you have now come to our office to see it in action. The machine has completely changed the manner in which we sell homes and enables us to drive maximum efficient production. If we build a home, we sell that home. We sell by digitally acquiring leads through our digital marketing programs, then we filter those leads, so the best leads go directly to our sales professionals. They nurture those best leads for customers while our dynamic pricing model assists in dynamically tailoring pricing in real-time to meet the market, given consumer desires, market conditions and competitive factors. The dynamically adjusted pricing using incentives or price alterations automatically adjust our margin up or down while we maintain production and sales base. We set the production to efficiency. We match sales pace to production, and we deliver the homes we build while we carefully maintain controlled inventory levels, all while reducing production costs and driving consistent cash flow. I know it all sounds easy, but it's not. But this has been a core pillar of the programming that we've been reworking over the past years, and it's really starting to kick in and work quite well. Next to our laser focus on volume with production and sales being an even better alignment, we are intensifying our focus on producing affordable and attainable product across our platform. We've recognized that the chronic housing shortage is a critical issue, and it's more than just a great talking point. The reality is that our industry needs to find solutions to building a healthier housing market that is attainable to participants across the economic landscape. Working-class housing is essential to the effective working of our cities across the country, and we hear that from mayors and governors everywhere. So we've been working on using our strategies for production and cost efficiencies to help build a healthier housing market that is accessible to everyone. Of course, it all starts with lower production costs across our platform. Land, we know is getting more expensive, impact fees also are getting more expensive and labor costs have been rising as well. We can only reduce our input costs by increasing productivity to efficiencies of our operations. Our focus has been on doing just that. We are building more consistent products that we call our core products that are carefully value-engineered, and we are using our start pace to enable an engineered production cycle as well enabling us to reduce cycle time and to work with our trade partners to build efficiencies in logistics and the way that we run our community production. We've also continued working on additional product approaches to help build a healthier housing market. We've intensified our focus on build-to-rent that is community scale and single-family for-rent, scattered home sale markets, we believe that we can and need to build additional production for professionally owned housing that can fill an important need. Those professional purchasers need cost efficiencies in today's interest rate environment in order to make their rents attainable and we can provide that. There are families who are building their future and aspire to single-family lifestyle with backyards and schools and parks but who can't yet afford a down payment or don't have the credit characteristics to qualify the mortgage that they need. Institutional buyers are filling that void for those families. Many across the industry have criticized the professionally owned market and the investor class that competes with primary homeowners to purchase product for rentals. This is flawed thinking. Those investors are actually filling a critical need for the underserved families who seek to bridge the lifestyle for their family while they build the down payment and credit score to ultimately achieve homeownership. This is the critical equitable side of home production, and the institutional buyers are not competitors to the primary buyers, they are additive to the valuable housing stock, enabling those who don't have a family that can help them achieve the lifestyle they want while they build their capital capacity. We are working across our platform with our institutional partners to produce more structured programs to provide more housing for those who need professional ownership as a stepping stone for the ultimate home of their own. We are also engaging our blue chip multifamily platform to build attainable rental product in an off-balance sheet configuration. We have a strong history of successfully building multifamily product across the country. We have been building those products in an off-balance sheet configuration, and we expect to continue to build this vital attainable product without encumbering our balance sheet. Finally, we have built and continued to refine our land strategy by design as well in order to dovetail with our production orientation. Every home that is going to be built needs a home site with a permit, and those home sites need to be optioned and off balance sheet until we're ready to build. We continue to focus on a just-in-time delivery program for land, just like we have for lumber and appliances and other products, and we continue to make excellent progress in this regard. We accomplished this by both negotiating option deals with landowners and developers. And we also – and also creating structured land bank strategies often with private equity capital. By consistently focusing on our land-light strategy, we've materially enhanced and generated consistent cash flow through the ups and downs of interest rate changes and we've enhanced our balance sheet and our liquidity even after redeeming debt and purchasing stock over the past years, along with purchasing $500 million of shares of stock through this quarter. Our balance sheet is situated today with a 9.6% homebuilding debt-to-total cap ratio with $5 billion of cash on hand and $0 drawn on our revolver and with an expected $3.5 billion plus or minus of net cash flow over this next year. Accordingly, we have the flexibility to allocate capital strategically first of course to grow while also retiring debt, paying appropriate dividends and repurchasing shares of Lennar stock. Accordingly, this quarter, we raised our dividend to $2 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion of stock repurchases as we continue to drive total shareholder returns. Even with these capital allocations, many have suggested that given the tremendous success of our migration to our land-light program, we have accumulated too much cash on our balance sheet, which limits the ability of our returns to move higher. While we have understood the concern, we have remained patient as we have evolved not just the migration to the land-light configuration, but also have remained focused on the long-term durability of the land bank structures involved. Private equity capital can be fickle. By driving volume through these programs, we have gained advantaged insights into and refined the workings of our strategic land banks. The underlying plumbing systems for the land banks has been refined and questions have now been answered as to the durability of the capital partners that make up the counterparty, [Technical Difficulty] namely us. Our consistent volume helped to find both trust and dependability and has taken those relationships to another level as we either party flinched as market conditions tested the boundaries of relationships. While adjustments were made and lessons were learned, the structures and relationships became stronger and more durable. Accordingly, we have now rekindled our focus on a strategic spin-off that can be cleanly focused on fortifying durable land strategy. By spinning our own land, excess land in a taxable spin, we believe that we can create an additional though with permanent capital vehicle that can option develop home sites to Lennar and recycle capital into new home site, while distributing market appropriate returns to shareholders. We have stood up a strong land vehicle that is under consideration, currently, with about $4 billion of land, it could be more, could be less, and it is under development and consideration right now. Such a transaction would distribute capital to shareholders, it would reduce inventory on Lennar's books, and it would provide permanent dependable capital for future land options. Our balance sheet would remain very strong with consistent earnings and cash flow to contribute to pay down debt and continue to repurchase stock. We know we've had a false start on a prior spin concept and there's no promise of certainty or completion on this program. But on the positive side, our Chief Operating Officer, Fred Rothman is singularly focused on this initiative and Fred likes to get things done. We'll keep you apprised of progress but progress should happen relatively quickly as this transaction is far simpler in structure. With that said, let me conclude by saying that our first quarter of 2024 has been another strategic and operational success for our company. While market conditions have remained challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across market. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize, and if the Fed is going to begin to actually cut rates, we believe that pent-up demand will be activated and we will be well-positioned and well prepared. If not, we will continue to produce volume and increase market share. To date, we have seen overall market conditions remain generally constructive for the industry. Even though higher interest rates have remained sticky, strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well-positioned for even greater successes as strong demand for affordable offering continues to seek short supply. Perhaps most importantly, our extraordinarily strong balance sheet affords us flexibility and opportunity to consider and execute upon thoughtful innovation for our future. We have the luxury in the short-term while we continuously in the short-term shareholders through dividend and stock buyback, while we also, and I emphasize the word also pursue strategic distribution to shareholders that fortifies our future as well. We have clearly earned an enviable position. As we look ahead to a successful 2024, we are well-positioned for and expect to see much more of the same. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow to perform and to drive Lennar to new levels of consistent and predictable performance. We are guiding to 19,000 to 19,500 closings next quarter with approximately a 22.5% margin and we expect to deliver approximately 80,000 homes this year with a little over 23% margin. We also expect to repurchase in excess of $2 billion of stock as we continue to drive very strong cash flow. We look forward to a very strong year and for that I want to thank the extraordinary associates of Lennar for their tremendous focus, effort and talent. And with that, let me turn over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Good morning. As you heard from Stuart, our operational teams at Lennar continue the execution of our core operating strategies in our first quarter. The focus starts with Lennar marketing and sales machine every quarter, our divisions continuously learn from their engagement with Lennar Machine, gain knowledge in how to use this information for decision making, provide feedback for enhancements and improve the machine and execution of our strategies. This continuous loop of learnings and improvements drive the wide [ph] analytics, which enable us to improve our matching of sales to our production pace. You can see the evolution of this improvement in our operating results as sales were evenly matched with starts in the first quarter and are projected to be evenly matched again in the second quarter. While there’s more progress to be made, this matching of sales and production is leveling out our closings from quarter-to-quarter. The goal is even flow deliveries where by design starts gradually increase quarter-over-quarter to ultimately provide a consistent number of deliveries throughout the year. This operating model produces the most significant of all the efficiencies that benefit our trade partners. To optimize the pricing of each home, this strategy is more than just about selling about the pace of sales, but about selling the right homes at the right price. In every division, Mondays are now referred to as machine Mondays. Our operating teams gather to review dashboards informing them of the prior week’s results compared to the planned activity. This analysis of the prior week’s activity from digital marketing leads to sales pace and price of homes sold is evaluated to see if we sold the right homes. Thus informing our decision making and we plotted course of action for the current week. As the week unfolds, this is reevaluated to make adjustments. All of this analysis enables each division to make ongoing adjustments matching sales to unsold production as homes progress towards completion. In our first quarter, as interest rates fluctuated, this process informed us as to where we have pricing power or where we need buy down of interest rates and/or other incentives to maintain the desired pace. The confidence we have in this by design sales strategy allows us to maintain consistent starts. These starts lead to increased market share. This has seen our growth of 28% in sales and 23% in deliveries year-over-year as our consistent starts have filled the void of other builders who pulled back. This consistency of starts and related share gain have positioned Lennar with a number one or two market share in 33 of our 40 operating divisions with 23 of these 33 divisions having the number one market share. Here are some examples of our markets where we have both the leading market share position and also have increased that share. In the Carolinas, market share in Raleigh improved to 20% up from 16% and Charleston at 24% up from 22%. In the Midwest, our market share in Indianapolis is up 7% to 34%, Minnesota is up 4% to 29% and Chicago is up 5% to 24%. Our market share in San Antonio grew by 6% to almost 24%. In San Diego, we grew from 35% to 40%, in Central Valley from 31% to 38% and in Tucson from 14% to 18%. In Florida, our market share increased in Tampa from 15% to 21% and in Jacksonville from 17% to 24%. Here in Miami, while we did not grow our industry-leading market share, we did maintain a very healthy 75% share. Our sales pace of 4.9 homes per community in Q1 is up from the pace of 3.9 in Q1 of last year. This increase was by design to match the starts pace of 4.9 from the fourth quarter of 2023. In our first quarter, the 30-year fixed rate was 7.37% at the start of the quarter, then down to 6.75% in the middle of January and back up above 7% in the middle of February. Using insights from dynamic pricing, our homebuilding teams work closely with our Lennar Mortgage teams to find the right mortgage solutions homebuyer by homebuyer. Onto cycle time and construction costs, as we continuously improve the way we execute this game plan, we are also continuously working to deepen the partnerships with our trade partners. We focus on maintaining both a high volume and a consistent volume of homes under construction. These and the other efficiencies discussed benefit our trade partners, enabling us to lower construction costs in a cooperative manner with our trades. By consistently starting homes, even as interest rates rose above 7% during the quarter, we increased our starts by 38% from the prior year and they were flat sequentially from Q4. This consistent and increased level of starts attracts a larger trade base to Lennar and together with a normalized supply chain led to another meaningful improvement in our cycle time. For the first quarter, cycle time decreased by seven days sequentially from Q4 down to 154 days on average for single family homes, a 30% decrease year-over-year. The cycle time stabilizing combined with ongoing efficiency gains, we are now designing build templates that will further reduce cycle time on future start. We focused on the building blocks volume, consistency, predictability, cycle time and even flow to achieve production efficiencies, enabling our trade partners to lower their supply chain and labor costs. Look at the first quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q4 by about 2% and on a year-over-year basis by about 11%. Moving forward to drive further efficiencies and cost reductions, we are laser focused on the consistent use of highly valued engineered home plans, which, as Stuart mentioned, we call our core product strategy. This strategy has recently begun implementation in Texas and is scheduled to be rolled out in Florida this year and will follow thereafter in the rest of our markets. These engineered efficiencies, together with significantly higher use frequency of these core plans will further cement our position as a builder of choice for our trade partners. The reduced cost and time to build these core plans will help us achieve the goal of delivering attainable housing to meet the needs of the home buying consumer. Next, I'll discuss our land light strategy. In the first quarter, we continue to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners where they purchased land on our behalf and then delivered just in time homesites to our homebuilding machine, as Stuart described. In the first quarter, about 80% of our $1.6 billion of land acquisitions in the quarter was finished homesites purchased from these various land structures. This 80% reflects a prior – reflects a view of prior land purchased into these structures that is now being delivered to us for home starts.  In the first quarter, about 90% of our new land acquisitions were acquired into our off balance sheet land structures. We continue to make significant progress in the first quarter as our years of supply owned – year supply of owned homesites improved to 1.3 years down from 1.9 years and our controlled homesites percentage increased to 77% from 68% year-over-year. The bottom line is focusing on our operating strategies, which result in a reduced cycle time and the reduction in land own has increased our cash flow as well as improved our inventory churn, which now stands at 1.5 versus 1.3 last year, a 15% increase. In the first quarter, we continue to refine the execution of the strategies, Stuart and I have reviewed with you. From the non-marketing and sales machine to our production processes and land strategies, our focus is consistent, improvements are continuous and changes ever present. Stuart said, it sounds simple, but it isn't. It's a lot of hard work, a lot of trial and error, and it takes a lot of grit. Fortunately, we have a great team of associates who have leaned into each of these strategies and are executing at the highest levels. I want to add my appreciation for their hard work and dedication. Now I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon. Good morning, everyone. So Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our home building performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our financial services operations, summarize again our balance sheet highlights and then provide high level estimates for Q2 2024. So starting with financial services. For the first quarter, our financial services team had operating earnings of $131 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $100 million compared to $59 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by an increase in lock volume, which was the result of higher homebuilding volume and a higher capture rate, as well as higher profit per locked loan, which resulted from higher secondary margins and lower cost per loan as the team continues to focus on efficiencies. Title operating earnings were $33 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and greater productivity as the team continues to embrace technology to run a more efficient business. These solid results work – these solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our homebuilding and financial services team, they truly represent the spirit of one Lennar. So now, turning to our balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to churn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market with the goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The results of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $5 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion lucid credit facility. This provided a total liquidity of $7.6 billion. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency and reducing our capital investments, we once again made significant progress on our goal of becoming asset light. As Jon mentioned, at quarter end, our years owned improved to 1.3 years from 1.9 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increased to 77% from 68% in the prior year. Our lowest years owned and highest controlled percent in our history. At quarter end, we owned just under 97,000 homesites and controlled 323,000 homesites for a total of 420,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital efficient way. As Jon mentioned, we spent $1.6 billion on land purchases this quarter, however, 80% were finished home-sites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on a just in time basis, which is less capital intensive. Our goal is that over time, we will continue to reduce our ownership of land and purchase homesites on adjust in time basis and our earnings should more consistently approximate cash flow as the need to reinvest back in the business is lessened. And finally, looking at returns, our inventory turn was once it was 30.5%. During the quarter, inconsistent with our production focus, we started about 18,300 300 homes and ended the quarter with just under 40,000 total homes in inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,200 models and also includes about 1,000 homes that were completed unsold, which is less than one home per community as we successfully manage our finished inventory levels. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 3.4 million of our outstanding shares for a total of $506 million.  Additionally, during the quarter, as Stuart mentioned, we increased our annual dividend to $2 per share from a $1.50 per share. So we paid total dividends this quarter of $139 million. And looking at our debt maturity profile, our next senior note maturity is 454 million, which is due in April 2024. So next month. Then there are no maturities until May of 2025. We continue to benefit from our previous paydowns of senior notes and strong earnings generation, which brought our homebuilding debts total capital down to 9.6% at quarter end and improvement from 14.2% in the prior year. We remain committed to increasing shareholder returns. Our stockholders’ equity increased to almost $27 billion and our book value per share increased to $95.74 and our return on equity was 15.8%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through 2024. With that brief overview, I’d like to turn to Q2 and provide some high level guidance. Starting with new orders. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 20,900 to 21,300 homes as we keep our production pace and sales pace closely aligned. We anticipate Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 19,000 to 19,500 homes, with a continued focus of efficiently turning inventory into cash. Our Q2 average sales price should be in the range of $420,000 to $425,000. We expect gross margins to be about 22.5% and our SG&A about 7.2%, with both estimates having some plus or minus, depending on market conditions. For the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $25 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q2 to be in the range of $110 million to $115 million based on expected product mix in our mortgage operations. We expect a loss of about $20 million for our multifamily business and also a loss of about $20 million for our Lennar Other category. The Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments, since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of the quarter. Our Q2 corporate G&A should be about 1.8% of total revenues and our charitable contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 274 million shares. And so on a combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.15 to $3.25 per share for the second quarter. For the full year, we remain committed to delivering 80,000 homes, which is about a 10% growth year-over-year with a gross margin that is consistent with last year’s gross margin. We also remain confident with our cash flow generation as we indicated. As such, we are still targeting a capital allocation of at least $2.5 billion, $454 million which will be allocated to the April debt maturity that I mentioned and the balance to share repurchases. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. And that comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys, good morning. Nice quarter and thanks [Technical Difficulty] very helpful. Appreciate it. Stuart, first one I wanted to ask you. It sounds like you – and maybe I’m reading too much into this, but it sounds like you were – and maybe I’m reading too much into kind of mortgage qualification issues a little bit more than you have in recent quarters. And I’m curious if you’ve seen something specifically in the near-term that is kind of leading you to highlight that? Or if you’re just kind of commenting more broadly on the fact that affordability is stretched, which I don’t think is much of a surprise to anybody at this point.
Stuart Miller: So I think it starts with the fact that affordability is stretched, but we are definitely seeing a little bit more credit card debt and personal debt from the customer showing up in their applications. We have seen some delinquencies in some of that debt. Bruce, maybe you’d like to comment a little on that.
Bruce Gross: Sure. I think what we’re seeing is when you look at the Niles, in particular more of the Niles are having a higher percentage relating to debt to total income. So there’s more debt to pay off. And that’s something new that we noticed this quarter. We often work with the buyers and we’re able to work through a lot of the conditions, but that one point is something that we’ve seen different this last quarter.
Alan Ratner: Got you. Bruce, great to hear your voice and thank you for that info. And then second question. It seems like the market is generally tracking in line with what you expected three months ago, and I think the guidance reflects that. Stuart, I think three months ago probably really the main difference is I think we and you and probably everybody were probably expecting rates to be lower by now, and some of the inflation metrics might be a little bit stickier than people were hoping for. So when you think about the margin guide for the back half of the year, it does imply a pretty healthy ramp. And I think your comments last quarter suggested an expectation that as rates move down, you would be able to pull back a little bit on incentives and discounts. And I’m just curious if that thought process has changed at all or if you’re seeing enough on the demand side today that you’ve either already done the heavy lifting on pulling back on incentives or you’re confident that that’s going to transpire over the next few months?
Stuart Miller: So really interesting question, Alan, and let’s start with the fact that demand is strong, and I can’t emphasize that enough, that demand is strong. Now with that said, there’s limited supply and there’s also affordability factors that are playing into this. And yes, there was a bit of enthusiasm in the market that interest rates were going to be moving down a number of times as we went through 2024, some of that enthusiasm has subsided. What I love about our program is that our program cuts through the middle. What I don't see is another ramp up in interest rates, but anything can happen. But inflation hasn't yet revealed itself as fully under control. And I don't feel like the Fed has built up that confidence yet that says we're ready to start moving interest rates. And our program enables us to succeed quite well if interest rates move down. In fact, we're were really levered to the fact that if interest rates move down, our margins should do quite well. But to the extent that interest rates basically stay the same or migrate upward a little bit, we're still pushing volume, pushing focus on rationalizing expenses or the cost of building homes together with maximizing price and minimizing incentives that actually have to be used in order to generate strong margins. So our view today stands exactly as it was three months ago, even though there was more enthusiasm at that time for rates going down, we feel pretty strongly that we're going to be able to accomplish the margin levels that we've talked about in the environment regardless of how it moves forward. We have a lot of levers to pull. And I think that we're really connected to the market, and we're very focused on production. And I think that production needs leverage at costs, whether it's SG&A or cost of production. And I think we're going to be able to produce our margin. Jon, anything?
Jon Jaffe: I think you covered it. As we said, we continue to refine our ability to focus on the right price per home, which we feel confident will allow become even better at those communities and markets where we can pull back our incentives even more, and we'll continue to find that. And I think that informs our confidence in what we see for the rest of the year.
Alan Ratner: Great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. 
Stuart Miller: You bet. 
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Yes, thanks very much guys. I appreciate all the color. I had a little bit of difficulty catching all your comments. So apologies if I'm repeating in here. But I believe, Stuart, you were discussing maybe a new iteration of Quarterra. And maybe, I don't know if you're still calling it that. But this time, you talked about $4 billion worth of land, I think, being included in this entity. Just wanted to get some more color around that. So is that about a half a year's worth of land? How is that $4 billion different from what was initially conceived? I think you initially talked about $4 billion, but I believe most of those have now already been put into fund structures. So what is this $4 billion in land? And how is it different? And then is it including other maybe what not – we might consider non-core assets as well? Can you just give us some more color on this new Quarterra?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So first of all, I have PTSD going backwards and talking about the prior spin. So, I'm not going to use the Quarterra name right now. Is that okay with you, Steve?
Stephen Kim: Totally fine.
Stuart Miller: I'm going to this [ph]. Okay. Good. So I'm not going to talk about this as a reincarnation of Quarterra because it isn't. With the prior spend, we were focused number one on a tax-free spend. And number two, it was basically our multifamily, single-family for rent assets that we were splitting into a different kind of operation. This is specifically taxable spend, straight down the fairway land that is basically under production that is regular operating land, it is not excess or ancillary property or anything like that, it should be cash flowing immediately, and it is just a straightforward spin of a land program that dovetails extremely well with what we already have in place relative to other land banking programs. This enables us to build yet another vertical that will be complementary to the others that we have, but it gives us a broader range of feeders that enable us to fortify the durability of our land-light strategy. And that's been our focus is how do we make sure and ensure that the market conditions we have today are market conditions that we can depend on in the future? Yes, we have land developers. Yes, we have land sellers that the auction land from, but we also have the added benefit of land banking structures, and we're creating another unique land banking structure with a permanent capital vehicle attribute that enables us to create that durability, that confidence that as we go forward, just like with lumber, just like with appliances, land becomes more of a commodity that we take down just in time.
Stephen Kim: That's really helpful. Appreciate the distinction there. How about these other assets, which were initially conceived to be in this entity – the previously been called Quarterra. Are there any plans for that?
Stuart Miller: Well, I think it's widely known that relative to our first fund of multifamily where we do have some investment that is currently under discussion as to how it will – it has come to the end of its fund life, and we're considering either a sale or some kind of extension program or something. Those assets will, over time, burn off. The new focus on multifamily is to be building in a more distinctly private equity-based program where we become much more of a production engine for more affordable product. The products that we were building historically and probably kind of fallen out of favor given interest rate changes. And yet affordable rental product is very desirable and something that we can produce much more comfortably within the Lennar homebuilding divisions. And so it will be much more of a production merchant build kind of program spending regularly just like the rest of our product.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Got you. That's helpful. Thanks very much for that. The second question I had is, I think earlier you were discussing in your prepared remarks, the cash that you have on your balance sheet, $5 billion. And I think you acknowledged that there was some interest in seeing how you are going to deploy that. And I believe you talked about that. Your response to that was that talked about a strengthening of your relationship with your land partners, how that has evolved, how would it have been tested over the last 1.5 years? And you have come through that now to a – at a place where you have now a much more robust relationship battle tested with your partners. And so it seemed to me that you were suggesting that the excess cash as you were holding maybe no longer served the purpose that it once did. I want to make sure that I and paraphrasing what you were saying correctly. And if so, it sort of still leaves open the question of, is there anything else that you might be waiting for that you want to be patient about to see before maybe deploying that cash?
Stuart Miller: Look, we've been unapologetic about the patients. As we've migrated to a land-light strategy, we wanted to be patient about recognizing that we are developing new sources of land relationships. We want to make sure that as the market ebbs and flows, that what we depended on did we [ph] evaporate. And then all of a sudden, we needed to have capital to be able to grow, to be able to produce. I think we've gained a tremendous amount of confidence in the structures that we’ve built. We're continuing to gain that confidence. We're looking to build more of those structures in order to have that durability baked in. So that we're much – we’re very comfortable holding a stronger balance sheet to just make sure that as we go forward, we continue to grow forward and have the capacity to do that. I think as we've gained confidence, the need for holding that cash becomes less and less important. I think that our $5 billion share repurchase authorization is an indicator that we're leaning more into returning capital to shareholders along with our dividend. And it's all in stepping stones. We're not afraid to go slower rather than to go fast. But the fact of the matter is we don't have something else out there that we're looking at that we're anticipating using cash for. It is simply safety stock, so to speak, to make sure that the plumbing system we put in place is durable for the future. And we'll continue to make sure that we're positioned for the future. And as we get that confidence, you can expect that we'll be buying back more stock. And that's where the allocation of capital is going to go. It's not going to go to something else that's unanticipated right now.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, or just about this afternoon. I appreciate all the detail and color as always. Two questions. First, a little bit more obviously on the – on this proposed land spend. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly because initially, I think to Steve's prior question, it kind of hit on different areas of your current land program or prior iterations of how you're thinking about moving different assets on or off the balance sheet. So it kind of sounds like this might be more of a – when you talk about a spin and a new or separate vehicle, my mind is kind of moving a little bit towards the four-star type of relationship of that they have with D.R. Horton. And the fact that there's a lot of land that is on the Forestar entity that is – has a lot of rights of first refusal, et cetera, to Horton. As opposed to something that I thought was more of the direction when you started talking about this, which was kind of more moving land towards your existing land banking or land bankers relationships, primarily thinking about the large facility that you have with Angelo Gordon. So just want to make sure that I'm thinking about it correctly in terms of it being more the former than the latter. And in thinking about that $4 billion number, I mean, right now in your press release, you have about $4.5 billion of – or $4.7 billion of land and land under development. So $4 billion would be a huge number, huge percentage of that amount. I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that that $4 billion is coming out of that bucket, and that would in effect represent over 80% of your lots owned that are on your balance sheet today.
Stuart Miller: So, Mike, I recognize your thirst for more detail, and we'll give you more detail as we refine our program. And I wouldn't be thinking about it through the lens of Forestar. We're probably not going to go in that direction. But we recognize that you would like to know more, and we'll give you greater detail as we refine the program.
Diane Bessette: Mike, the other thing I would add, because you might have been alluding to it, is that this will be structured. So there won't be any consolidation on our balance sheet. It would be true – a true spin of land that's in a separate entity. So we wouldn't have any of those complexities of consolidation.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. So – but just on that point, if you're talking about a $4 billion type of number, it would appear that that represents the – again, over 80% of the land and land under development. So we're talking about, in effect, the majority of your land holdings. Is that the right way to think about it?
Stuart Miller: We have been moving to a land light strategy. That would be correct.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. Secondly, on the gross margin front, was asked earlier about back half of the year? And it seems like to get to the guidance of roughly flat year-over-year for the full-year you're looking at back half gross margins of roughly 24% on average. We talked about maybe the mortgage market being perhaps less potentially a downward slope throughout the year than was initially anticipated. What is necessary to hit that 24% in the back half? Is it kind of already, I would assume on the books from a land cost basis, construction cost basis. Or are there – do you need to have less costly incentives or better pricing? Because at this point to the extent that that doesn't come through, it seemed like the only way to hit that 24% if it was much more of just a mix and what's coming through the pipe, so to speak.
Stuart Miller: So as we've detailed, our focus and programming has been really carefully crafted by design to focus on using our production programs to bring down costs and to use our machine to focus on right pricing, whether it's price increases as the market gives them or whether it's the very carefully crafted use of incentives. So the first thing is post reconciliations together with copper price, we feel comfortable that we're going to be able to migrate in that direction. The second part of it is leverage. As we go through the year we're generally producing and delivering more homes. So there are some embedded leverage in that and so there are a lot of moving parts that make up our view of where our margin is likely to go. Of course, market conditions can change. They can change to the positive and to the negative. And we've been very clear that that margin is somewhat of a springboard for maintaining the volume that we expect to maintain. So there will be elements of the economic environment that factor into it as well. Can I detail specifically what the relationships are in those numbers? I don't think so right now but it's a combination of all of those pieces that will drive our margins to where we expect them to be for the year. We do have some visibility in some of the sales that have come through, and we continue to have confidence that we're going to be able to get to that number – to those numbers by the end of the year.
Jon Jaffe: And I think as we said earlier, some interest rates stay relatively flat with where they are. We think we can continue to improve our operational view of how to increase margins in that same interest rate environment.
Mike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much.
Jon Jaffe: Okay. You bet.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Kenneth Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open.
Kenneth Zener: Good morning everybody or afternoon now. Want to start kind of high level here to understand or for you to clarify perhaps even flow, where starts lead orders, which is less cyclical. So first high-level question, what is your start capacity based on kind of your land partners, right? There's some type of guardrails we have there and one of the big focuses of the industry are you going to grow or return in general? And on the land spin, why are you guys choosing to introduce this vehicle versus building out the homes or see knowing it as you have been doing back already, I guess.?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So first question first. Production is clearly derived from how many home sites we have available. I think that we have mapped out what we think the production can be given the home sites that we have coming through the system. And we would expect that what you are seeing as a production schedule is very well baked into both the land availability and each cycle of becoming developed home sites. So think about the way that you're seeing production put in place to get to that, let's call it, 80,000 delivery number plus some overage for what falls into the next year, that's already baked into what the start space will be, as I day-lighted, 21,000 starts this quarter. We have, of course, excellent visibility as to the home sites that are coming through the system for that and likewise into the next quarters as well. Jon, did you want to add anything to that?
Jon Jaffe: Yes. Relative to this first question, the land goes into our land banking relationships; it goes into it with a takedown schedule that not just what Stuart just described. So there are no guardrails that limit our ability to execute on the planned volume.
Stuart Miller: So then as it relates to your second question we've been very focused on building multiple sources of capital for our optioning and land banking programs. Actually building a permanent capital vehicle rather than being completely reliant on private equity capital constantly coming into a program, we felt was a greater good and a big benefit. So when you ask a question why go in a different direction when some of the tried and true direction so far are viable as well? They are viable, and we continue to lean into those programs. This is an and rather than an or, this to us, a building, the durability, that confidence that the capital will be there even as the market ebbs and flows going forward. And so that’s why we’re choosing to build this way rather than just drive as we have by putting – taking land from balance sheet, building machine [ph] and all of that, this is a cleaner way to build a permanent capital vehicle that’s doable for the future.
Kenneth Zener: Okay. Appreciate that. That’s good. My second question is about margin communication, which is one of the factors affecting investors today. So margins in your forecast for second half, nobody knows the future, right? And you’re trying to help us. But I think everything you’ve been talking about even before was much more important to your capital allocation and the true returns of your company as you go asset light. So do you see – and I think we all can model what that free cash flow will be within a range. Do you see – when you get to that comfort level, where land is neutralized? Therefore, net income equals cash flow. Do you guys see yourself systematically buying back stock in line with net income? Or do you – when we get to that point, or are you guys going to try to time it, obviously, with NVR we see that they’ve run up a lot of cash. So do you guys – are you hoping to have essentially buybacks match net income systemically when you’re there? Or is there something else we should know about your thinking when that time arrives? Thank you. 
Stuart Miller: No. I think that, generally speaking, I think we’re migrating to a more orderly buyback program. We’ve been conservative in our buyback program. As I’ve noted, to make sure that the systems that we put in place are durable for our future. So that conservatism should be confused. As we look ahead, we don’t have a thought process around the different use of cash. In fact, we’re growing into the cash flow model that we’ve created. And as we find that it is more durable, sustainable and we test kind of the edges, we can kind of expect that the cash we’re generating is basically going to go right back into stock buyback.
Diane Bessette: Yes, Jon, I think what I would add is, as you know, previously, we prioritized debt repayment over that. But after we make this April payment, we’ll only have $2 billion of notes outstanding and it’s one in 2025, one in 2026 and I think the other is in 2027. So we don’t have that priority to focus on anymore. So I think Stuart’s point is an important one that stock buyback really does become the priority, because I think, we’ve done a nice job of deleveraging the balance sheet from a debt standpoint.
Kenneth Zener: Agree, and thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Very good. And why don’t we go to our last question now.
Operator: Thank you. That last question is from John Lovallo with UBS. Your line is open. 
John Lovallo: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. I mean, I guess the first one, just going back to the spin for a moment. I mean if the purpose here is to sort of guarantee capital for Lennar to grow and sort of guarantee land banking, even if private equity pulls back, I mean, it would seem that the spin would need to be very well financed, a strong balance sheet how much cash do you envision to spin meeting?
Stuart Miller: Probably not very much. I think that the assets, as they’re configured or as we’re thinking about it, should be cash flowing pretty readily. And therefore, the stream will actually spend cash and bring in the cash and redeploy and should work well on some.
John Lovallo: Okay. Understood. And then maybe just zeroing in on the second quarter gross margin outlook, which is up about 70 basis points sequentially at the midpoint. Can you just walk us through some of the moving pieces there? Net price cost inflation, incremental cost inflation things of that nature.
Diane Bessette: Yes. John, I think that we can walk through it more in detail, but I think that if you look at the second quarter of last year, it’s very comparable. So you can see the leverage pickup, particularly in field expenses. Just in order of magnitude, you kind of get a lot of pickup just from that perspective. So that’s certainly helpful. And I don’t know if there’s anything more to say on that. I think we’ve talked about controlling incentives showing the right homes, but part of the credibility should be just the operating leverage that we’re going to get in addition to the other things that we spoke about.
John Lovallo: Okay. Thank you. 
Stuart Miller: Okay. Well, that wraps it up for this quarter. I thank everybody for joining us out of the quarter that we put forth. We look forward to reporting more progress as we go forward. Thanks for your time, and we’ll get to next quarter.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. Have a wonderful day, and you may disconnect.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Good morning everybody and thank you for joining today. I am in Miami today together with Jon Jaffee our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice-President; Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services, and a few others as well. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give an operational overview updating construction costs, cycle time and some of our land strategy and position. As usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. And then of course we'll have our question-and-answer period. As usual, I would like to ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many as possible. So, let's begin. We are very pleased to report another very strong quarter and year-end operating results for Lennar. We've executed our operating plan effectively over the past year and accordingly, have simply never been better-positioned from balance sheet to operating strategy to address market conditions in the New Year 2024. Throughout 2023, the dominant theme at the macro level has been the impact of higher interest rates on the homebuilding consumer as affordability has been tested, and demand has been constrained, but the ability to purchase i.e., affordability and the ability to qualify. Generally speaking, consumers are employed and are generally confident that they will remain employed and the compensation will generally rise. Overall, consumer confidence has been reasonably strong, and buyers that can transact have transacted. Underlying this environment is a general chronic supply shortage of homes, especially affordable homes across the country as well as a growing pent-up demand for housing that has -- that is and has been held back by materially higher interest rates. There has been a very short supply of affordable products and a very strong demand for affordable products. The new homebuilders have worked out a variety of tenant structures that range from interest rate buy-downs to closing cost pickups to price reductions to meet the buyer, the purchaser at the intersection of need and affordability. The existing home market has been quiet as existing homeowners have coveted their low-interest rate mortgages and remained on the sidelines. Homebuilders have been uniquely able to activate demand by using incentives that unlock the affordability constraints and enable purchasers to transact. Over the past quarter, this narrative has been particularly difficult as interest rates spiked through the first two months of the quarter and then began to ease in November. As mortgage rates began to migrate from 7.5% towards 8%, the market began to feel like it was hitting a real inflection point and the overall market conditions softened materially. Most recently, of course, Chair Powell and the Fed has signaled that we might be closer to the end of the tightening cycle and we might see lower rates as we enter 2024, you get into the new year, we will see. Against this backdrop, Lennar's consistent strategy throughout the past year has been to continue to drive volume, to find affordability, to meet demand by using our dynamic pricing model, and using appropriate incentives and provide supply to the market. Over the past year, we have consistently detailed our operating strategy with the expectation that we would do as follows. Number one, reduce our land assets while growing our business. Number two, drive strong and consistent bottom-line earnings, while concurrently generating consistent net cash flow. Number three, reduce our construction cycle times, while increasing our inventory turn. And number four, ultimately enhance the quality of our returns on equity and return on assets by focusing on the allocation of liquid assets, i.e., cash. 2023 was a year of strategy and successful execution for Lennar and sets us up extremely well for another strong year of execution in 2024. We began the year with a strong statement of operating strategy in a higher interest-rate environment and we focus on execution throughout the year. Even as the macroeconomic environment continued to shift and adjust to inflation with higher interest rates, we adhered to our strategy and we drove volume and production. We believe that demand was strong, though constrained by affordability, and supply was very limited. As others pull back, we leaned in and maintained pace. We defined our operating strategy as driving production and sales pace while using price, incentives, and margin reduction to enable affordability. Rather than further constraining supply, we drove production and used our formidable size and scale to enable cost and operating efficiencies to drive affordability. As you've seen in our press release, while driving higher volume, we also achieved strong operating results. We delivered over 73,000 homes in 2023, which represents a 10% year-over-year volume increase over 2022, and we delivered a strong bottom-line of $3.9 billion or $4.82 a share. We also generated well in excess of the $3.5 billion of homebuilding cash flow that we generated, relative to what we generated in '22 and we are well-positioned with land and community count to expect to deliver 80,000 homes in 2024. Again, another 10% increase year-over-year. Given the current interest-rate signal from the Fed, we would also expect that margins will be at least consistent with our 2023 levels. And although we have embedded lower margins that will flow through in the first quarter, those reduced margins will clear over the next quarter, and using our dynamic pricing tool, we will recover margin quickly and efficiently as lower interest rates enable us to reduce incentives. The strategic benefits of driving volume came and will continue to come with advantages that are both immediately valuable as well as durable for the company's future. I'd like to briefly detail some of those advantages. First, by driving volume, we gained market share in most of our core markets as we leaned in when some others pulled that back. Our trade partners saw a consistent and dependable partner that became worthy of the designation of builder of choice. We worked side-by-side with our traditional trade partners, and additionally, we found additional trade partner relationships with participants that found that they had dependable and consistent work with our strategy. Through market share growth in local markets, we enhanced the ability to better manage our costs, enhance our efficiency of operation, reduce cycle times with efficient production templates, and enhance our inventory turn. Diane will discuss this in more detail shortly. Next and maybe most important, by driving volume, we are positioned with land and communities for strong volume in all of our operating markets. As we drove volume and delivered homes, we purchased new land in communities for the next year's delivery. We are extremely well-positioned to continue to sell on pace as prices recover and as incentives subside alongside lower interest rates. We are positioned to drive even stronger bottom-line results and cash flow as market conditions normalize. Additionally, by driving volume, we gained market share in land acquisition. Simply put, we continue to sell land by selling homes and then purchase land to replace communities, especially when others walked away. Market share advances have given us the critical position to be in even stronger land buyer of choice to the owners and developers of critical land assets. They saw a dependable market participant remain consistent as market conditions became more tenuous, and we found that we were able to experiment with innovative land structures that worked constructively as markets falter and then recover. Noteworthy in this regard is our variable land pricing tool that enables home site values to move up or down as a percentage of the sale price of the home as markets move up and down. Next, by driving consistent volume even at lower margin, we generated consistent cash flow through more challenging times and enhanced our balance sheet and our cash liquidity even after redeeming or repurchasing $1.1 billion of senior notes through the year and repurchasing 10 million shares of Lennar's stock through the year. Situated today with a 9.6% homebuilding debt-to-total cap ratio, with $6.3 billion of cash-on-hand and $0 drawn on our revolver and with an expected $3.5 billion plus or minus of net cash flow over the next year, we have the flexibility to invest capital strategically and grow while retiring debt as it matures and repurchasing shares of Lennar's stock, which we expect to repurchase at least $2 billion of stock over the next year. Fourth, by driving volume we gained advantaged insights into and refined the workings of our strategic land banks. The flow of volume through the land banking relationships that define our current approach to land acquisition was invaluable. Questions have now been answered as to the durability of the capital partners that make up the counterparty relationship with the homebuilding machine. Our consistent volume helped define both trust and dependability and making those -- and taking those relationships to another level as neither party flinched as market conditions tested the boundaries of the relationship. While adjustments were made and lessons were learned, the structures and relationships became stronger and more durable. Fifth, by driving volume, especially in the more difficult interest-rate environment of the past year, we were able to develop, enhance, use, and improve the Lennar machine. Our sales, marketing, and dynamic pricing machine is quickly becoming an advanced digital engine that has materially benefited by aggressive focused use and engagement while the market was most difficult. We focused on what was required to drive volume, while market conditions challenged affordability. We pushed data and engagement through the component parts of this digital tool and stressed it often into its limits. We reviewed 40 points of feedback from our 40 operating divisions and made adjustments and refinements as we learn. Today, and the result is that Lennar's machine is becoming an invaluable partner as we drive volume by finding market at affordable pricing and driving sales at the same pace as production. Overall, our strategic focus on driving volume in both production and sales has enabled us to become a stronger and better-positioned company that has become more durable through the ups and downs of housing cycles. Our balance sheet has never been stronger and our operating platform has never been better aligned. Our fourth quarter and year-end of 2023 has been another strategic and operational success for our company. While market conditions have been challenging, we have consistently learned and found ways to address market needs. We know that demand is strong and there is a chronic housing supply shortage that needs to be filled. We will continue to drive production to meet the housing shortage that we know persists across our markets. With that said, as interest rates subside and normalize, and if the Fed is going to begin to actually cut rates, we believe the pent-up demand will be activated and we will be well prepared. To date, we've seen overall market conditions remain generally constructive for our industry as higher interest rates has subsided strong pent-up demand has found ways to access the housing market. Most recent movements in interest rates suggest a better road ahead. Accordingly, we executed on our core strategy against the most difficult economic and industry backdrop. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well-positioned for even greater success as strong demand for affordable offerings continues to see short supply. We expect to start the new year with strong sales -- strong starts, sales, and closings as we have guided to 16,500 to 17,000 deliveries in the first quarter and a 21% to 21.25% margin as lower-margin sales move through the first quarter. We engaged the changing tides of the past year with a consistent strategy that has enabled certainty of execution throughout our company. Our strategy is well known and understood throughout our division offices and we have a simple and consistent model of execution. We focus on maintaining volume while we price our homes to drive match pace. We work with our trade base to manage costs and efficiencies and adjust product offering to meet the market. We manage both our land and our production inventories to drive efficiency, cash flow, and returns on our asset base. We focus on our land light model in order to drive balance sheet efficiency. Finally, we fortify our balance sheet to have the liquidity for strength and flexibility. Knowing what to do and executing per plan has driven this quarter's and this year's success and ensures consistent success for the foreseeable future. As we look ahead to a successful 2024, we are well positioned for and expect to see much more of the same. We are confident that by design, we will continue to grow, perform, and drive Lennar to new levels of performance. With that, let me turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffee: Good morning. As Stuart discussed, our operational teams at Lennar continued focusing on executing our operating strategies in our fourth quarter. As our divisions continuously learned from their engagement with Lennar machine, they provide feedback for enhancements and improve the machine in our execution of our strategies. You can see the evolution of this improvement in our even flow operating strategy throughout the year as starts and sales for the second half of 2023 were evenly matched at 37,053 and 37,032 respectively. In the fourth quarter, our production pace as defined by an average of five starts per community per month and average sales pace of 4.7 sales per community per month. Importantly, this strategy is not just about the pace of sales but it's importantly about selling the right homes at the right pace. Our machine matches up unsold production as homes progressed towards completion with pricing information from our dynamic pricing model on a community-by-community and home-by-home basis. In the fourth quarter, as interest rates peaked, this process informed us as to how much we needed to buy-down interest rates and/or offer other incentives to maintain the desired pace. We maintain a consistent starts and sales pace generating increased market share in almost all of the markets we build in. This is seen in our overall growth of 10% from last year as our consistent starts have killed the board of other builders who will pull back. Some examples of markets where we have leading and increased market share in 2023 over 2022 are as follows. Here in South Florida, we are ranked as the number one builder with a market share of 74%, up from 63% a year ago in Dade County and 33% in Broward County, up from 28%, Across the state, in Southwest Florida, we have a 38% market share, double that of the number two builder. In the Carolinas, we are the number one ranked builder in Charlotte, Raleigh, and Charleston with market shares of 10.5%, 16% and 22.5% respectively, representing an average increase in share of about 150 basis points. In the Midwest, we are number one in Indianapolis and Minnesota, with over 25% market share in each market, an increase of over 400 basis points in each. In Texas, we have increased market share in each of the markets there. In Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth by 200 basis points to 11.5% and 10% respectively. In Houston, by 300 basis points to 11.5%, and in San Antonio by 700 basis points to 22.5%. In Colorado, where we rank number one with almost 10% market share, which is double that of the number two builder who’s been the perennial market leader. Moving out West in Phoenix and Las Vegas, we have the number one share with 12% and 18% respectively. In California, we're the number-one builder in all of the markets there and have grown selected market share across the state from 25% in the Inland Empire and Central Valley to more than 35% in San Diego and Sacramento. And lastly in the Pacific Northwest, we are largest in Seattle and Portland with 14% and 17% share respectively, both an increase of about 250 basis points. The execution of our pricing strategy is based on the strength of each individual market matched against the level of production by community in that market. As Stuart noted, the market conditions in our fourth-quarter were defined by the chronic shortage of housing supply and more volatile interest-rate environment as compared to greater variations in market strength across our markets that we saw in prior quarters. In the current margin environment, all markets are benefiting to similar degrees from greater demand and supply. Our sales pace of 4.7 homes per community in Q4 is up from the pace of 3.7 compared to Q4 2022, further demonstrating improvement in executing the strategy of pacing in Q4 is that it was the same as our overall pace for fiscal 2023. As interest rates rapidly moved higher during the quarter, our homebuilding teams worked in close coordination with Lennar Mortgage to find the right mortgage solution home buyer by home buyer. Focused execution of the process I just described, led to completing the quarter with less than one unsold inventory home per community. Our strategy of finding market-clearing pricing to match the pace of sales to homes under construction allows us to maintain both a high volume and a consistent volume of homes under construction, which is the foundation for our builder-of-choice program with our trade partners. As we continuously improve the way we execute this game plan, we have deepened the partnerships with our trade base. Working together with our trade partners, we have consistently eliminated and/or prevented supply-chain constraints and reduced cycle times. These and other efficiencies that benefit our trade partners enable us to lower construction costs in a cooperative manner with our trades. By consistently starting homes, despite the changing interest-rate environment during the quarter, we increased our starts in the fourth quarter by 43% from the prior year and starts were flat sequentially from Q3. This increase in starts attracts a larger trade base to Lennar, and together with a normalized supply-chain environment led to another significant improvement in our cycle time. For the fourth quarter, cycle time decreased by 22 days sequentially from Q3, down to 161 days on average for single-family homes. In most of our markets, this represents being at or close to pre-pandemic cycle times. Looking at the fourth quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q3 by about 4%. In addition, our Q4 costs were down about 13% on a year-over-year basis. This is a direction of construction cost we expect in our guidance from last quarter. Moving forward, we expect cost to be consistent with where they are now over the next few quarters. In order to further improve our production efficiencies, we're working side-by-side with our trade partners on value engineering, co-planned series, and production sequencing across markets to reduce the cost and time to build with a goal of delivering a greater value to the homebuying customer. Next, I'll discuss the execution of our land-light strategy. In the fourth quarter, we continued to effectively work with our strategic land and land-bank partners where they purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time finished homesites to our homebuilding machine as Stuart described. Consistent with the third quarter, about 84% of our $1.5 billion of land acquisition in the quarter was finished homesites purchased from our various land structures. We've made significant progress in the fourth quarter as our years' supply of owned homesites improved to 1.4 years from 1.9 years, and our controlled homesite percentage increased to 76% from 69% year-over-year. The bottom-line is focusing on our operating strategies, which results in a reduction in cycle time, any reduction that own land has, as Stuart articulated, increased our cash flow as well as helped improve our inventory churn, which now stands at 1.5 versus 1.2 last year, a 25% increase. Our community count at the end of the fourth quarter was 1,260, which is up 4% from the year-ago period and we expect to increase our community count in the mid to high single-digits by the end of fiscal 2024. I want to recognize and thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in focusing on the execution of our strategies and also importantly for accomplishing the change management needed for the required process changes and implementing these strategies of our machine, while at the same time delivering a very strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning everyone. So, Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore I'm going spend a few minutes on the results of our Financial Services operations in our balance sheet and then provide some comments on the first quarter. So, looking at Financial Services, for the fourth quarter, the Financial Services team had operating earnings of $168 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $119 million compared to $80 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher locked volume as a result of higher orders and capture rate and higher profit per locked loan as a result of higher secondary margins and lower cost per loan, as the team continues to focus on efficiencies. Title operating earnings were $50 million compared to $44 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and greater productivity, as the team continues to embrace technology to run a more efficient business. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our Homebuilding and Financial Services team. They truly operate under the banner of One Lennar. Now turning to our balance sheet, this quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash on maintaining production and pricing homes to market with a goal of delivering as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The results of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $6.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $8.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity. As a result of these -- of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we once again, as Jon mentioned, made significant progress on our goal of becoming asset-light. At quarter-end, our years owned increased to 1.4 years from 1.9 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increased to 76% from 69% in the prior year; our lowest years owned and highest control percent in our history. At quarter-end, we owned just under 100,000 homesites and controlled 310,000 homesites for a total of 410,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. We spent $1.5 billion on land purchases this quarter, with 84% in finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. This is consistent with our manufacturing model of buying land on an adjustment basis, which is less capital-intensive. And finally, looking at returns, our inventory turn was 1.5 times and our return on inventory was 29%. I will make one comment about our inventory balance. This quarter we re-classed deposits on future land purchases and inventory into a separate line on our balance sheet. This re-class, which was about $2 billion at year-end was made to better align ourselves with most participants in our industry and thus brings greater comparability and less confusion to the investor and analyst communities. During the quarter and consistent with our production focus, we started about 18,400 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 38,200 total homes in inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,200 models and also includes about 1,200 homes that were completed and sold, which is slightly less than one home per community as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. In our continued effort to further strengthen and de-risk our balance sheet by reducing our debt balances, as we've mentioned in the fourth quarter, we redeemed the remaining balance, $378 million of our 4.875% senior notes during December 2023 and repurchased 110 million of senior notes due in fiscal 2024 and 2027 all at/or below par for a quarterly total of $488 million. For the full year, we repaid or redeemed $1.1 billion of senior notes. As a result of these debt reduction initiatives, we ended the quarter with a total senior note balance of about $2.5 billion. There is only one note due in 2024, which is $454 million due in April. Combined with strong earnings, our Homebuilding debt-to-total capital was 9.6% at quarter-end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 14.4% in the prior year. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased $3 million of our outstanding shares for $337 million in the fourth quarter and for the year, we repurchased 10 million shares totaling $1.1 billion. Additionally, we paid dividends of $105 million during the quarter and $431 million for the year. So, in total, we returned almost $1 billion to our equity and debt holders in the fourth quarter and about $2.7 billion for the full fiscal year. And then few final points regarding our balance sheet, our stockholders' equity increased to almost $27 billion and our book value per share increased to $94.61. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet and strong liquidity position provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we enter 2024. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to Q1. Given the evolving interest-rate environment, we'd like to once again provide some guidelines for Q1 to assist with your modeling, starting with new orders. We expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 17,500 to 18,000 homes as we keep production pace and sales pace closely aligned. We anticipate our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 16,500 to 17,000 homes with a continued focus on efficiently turning inventory into cash. Our Q1 average sales price should be about $420,000 and we expect gross margins to be in the range of 21% to 21.25%, indicating some impact from higher interest rates in Q4. Additionally, also remember that our Q1 margins are always negatively impacted by the current-period expensing of fuel costs. While we are working towards an even flow process of starting and constructing homes on a fairly consistent quarterly basis, revenues in Q1 are the lowest of the year because of seasonality. So for this Q1, the current period expensing will have a negative gross margin impact of approximately 150 basis points when you look sequentially from Q4. Also note, consistent with last year, the first-quarter will be a low-point of margin during 2024. Turning to SG&A, we expect to be in the range of 8% to 8.2% for Q1. For the combined Homebuilding joint-venture land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $20 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q1 to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, and we expect a loss of about $25 million for our Multifamily business and a loss of about $15 million for the Lennar Other category. The Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our public technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end-of-the quarter. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2.2% of total revenues. These expenses are likely to trend up a bit as we continue to invest in cyber security and technology development that is robust and durable to support our future growth. And our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax-rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted-average share count should be approximately 279 million shares. And so on combined basis, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $2.15 to $2.20 per share for the first quarter. And then finally, just to reiterate a few notes on fiscal 2024. As we indicated, we affirm our target of 10% to literally growth in 2024, which would result in approximately 80,000 deliveries for the year. And for gross margin, as Stuart mentioned, we expect to maintain the levels produced in 2023. Whilst we also remain confident in our cash flow generation, as such, we continue to be committed to allocating capital to our stakeholders. We're targeting a total capital allocation of at least $2.5 billion for 2024 remembering that $454 million will be allotted to our April 2024 debt maturity and the balance of roughly $2 billion to share repurchases. I'd like to end by sincerely thanking the Lennar financial team’s accounting, planning and IR for their combined great efforts that allow us to host our year-end earnings call two weeks after year-end. You guys are amazing. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much, guys. Yeah, so much great information you provided. So thanks a lot. I imagine folks will be asking you about a little bit more detail on the gross margin. So what I actually wanted to focus on was your balance sheet. And in particular, you ended the year with very heavy level of cash, over $6 billion, I think, on the homebuilding cash. And I was curious what you feel sort of a normal level once all the dust settles and you get to a level of cash where you feel sort of sustainable and appropriate to sustain over the long term. What that level roughly would be, how we should think about that? And related to that, given that I assume $6 billion is probably more than that number, I'm guessing by maybe a couple of billion or something like that, your $2 billion in share repurchases that you sort of set as the baseline level seems frankly a little low, given that we're expecting you guys to generate cash flow and so forth this year. So I was wondering if you could help us understand how we should be thinking about your cash balance going forward? And what it would take for you to apply more of that to repurchases and I guess I should have specified that, I'm curious if you could articulate why you're willing to hold more cash than you need at this time?
Stuart Miller: Well, Steve, let me start by saying you know the old adage, rich or poor, it's good to have cash, right? So just starting there, I would say that we're really rolling into the new us and developing a by-design approach to the way that we operate our business. And as is the case with evolution in general, you kind of grow into with some stops and starts, the new version of how you kind of look at the way you've configured. So I would say this. We're starting to look at our cash flow numbers, cash flow generation. We're starting to see kind of a consistency year-over-year in the kind of a baseline in the $3 billion, $3.5 billion range. You'll probably see in our Q that or in our K that, that number will be higher for 2023, but the amount of consistent annual cash flow is something that we're watching develop over time. And so when you ask your question that fits into the context of how do we think about the certainties of the programming that we have in place. As I noted in my comments, one of the interesting things of this past year was looking at the durability of our land banking relationships, the capital providers and the execution in and around land bank as markets become stressed. There's been a tremendous amount of learning around that and evolution. So the answer to the question is we kind of see our steady state cash flow is developing around $3.5 billion a year. How much cash we feel comfortable holding is something that we're -- we recognize that maybe $6 billion or $5 billion or $7 billion. Some might say that, that's too much. As we gain confidence as we start looking at the buy design approaches to the component parts of what's developing into Lennar machine, we're going to be increasing the amount that we return to shareholders through stock buybacks and other mechanisms. And so we might be a bit behind the curve that people perceive. Right now, we're going slower rather than faster as we develop new core components to our strategy that are becoming etched in stone and where we're developing confidence. So again, it might be a little slower than some might think it should be, but we are hitting stride with our comfort zone in buying back stock and thinking about the deployment of liquid assets.
Stephen Kim: Really helpful because, obviously, you're undergoing a very significant transformation, and I think I'm hearing a lot of steady state. I'm hearing a lot of predictability in what you're laying out. And obviously, that's something that we think is critically important to an eventual revaluation. It just seems like when you had initially -- when you started off your comments, you said it's good to have cash, but I think when you're arguing for a revaluation, some of the investors that we speak with would argue that holding too much cash actually is a hindrance to a revaluation because it effectively seems like the company may be holding on to cash with the hope that they could deploy it in some sort of traditional way, i.e., land or something like that, which maybe isn't in line with what a lot of the rhetoric around being asset-light is. So your commentary about this is a period of time where you were sort of gradually developing the systems to the point where you have that predictability, I guess it's helpful. So if I'm interpreting your comments right, we should basically expect the level of cash to come down to maybe a lower level, once you have established those systems to your satisfaction, but you're not there yet. Is that a proper way of paraphrasing what you're saying?
Stuart Miller: Thank you for the commentary. I think that helps me answer a little bit better. And let me say that we are decidedly not holding on to cash to execute the next large-scale M&A program or some out-of-the-box growth program. So, I wanted to spell that thought process. It simply is -- and this past year has been an incredible year for our company in terms of developing the confidence around durable systems that are actually working very well. It's been a proving ground. And so I would say, don't read too much into the holding of cash. It simply is the development of confidence and stride in terms of the way that we deploy liquid assets.
Stephen Kim: Okay. That's helpful. Really appreciate it. There was some news very recently regarding the marketing of your rental portfolio. I was wondering if you could put some context around that for us because we got a lot of questions from folks around whether this is something that we should be expecting to provide a cash infusion even above and beyond the normal operations would generate.
Stuart Miller: So look, I think that the base answer to that question is, we'll see. The determination to market portfolio was driven by limited partners. And the timing is one where it's kind of a suboptimal time to be thinking about a sale, although who knows where interest rates go, that could change quickly. So we'll see what happens. There might or might not be. This is an episodic kind of program where it will happen or it won't, but it won't be material to the either the balance sheet or the income statement company. I'm sure if there's any profit would be discounted. And in terms of the cash infusion, it would simply be additive to our cash position and maybe can inspire us to do more stock buyback. So we'll just have to wait and see on that. I don't think there's any additional guidance that could be given at this point.
Stephen Kim: Appreciate that. Thanks so much, Stuart.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Yeah, thanks for all the detail and congrats on the great performance this year. Stuart, I'd love to get your thoughts because I heard a lot in the commentary about the tailwinds that you guys had over the course of this year related to tight inventory and the interest rate move these last few days or weeks has been obviously striking. But I think one of the great unknowns and uncertainty is what impact that does have on the resell market as far as potentially freeing up some inventory and getting some people move. And obviously, there's puts and takes to that on your business. But what is your expectation there assuming kind of rates settle out near current levels as far as what that could do to the resale market and how the new home market might react to higher inventory levels in ’24.
Stuart Miller: Really interesting question, Alan. I thought about this a lot over the past year as the resale market has appropriately held down to mortgages that are very attractive interest rates and therefore, have not added to the traditional supply that defines the resale market. But the more I think about it and test my thinking, it just seems to me to be a zero-sum game if the resale market is activated by a tick down in interest rates, which it might be because in traditional fashion, first-time buyers find that the family is growing and they move up to a move up, second move up position. It does seem to me that to the extent that interest rates do activate the resale market and additional supply comes on the market, along with that supply comes additional demand because what has been missing from the market is the traditional resell buyer looking for that move-up home and decided the first-time market have been very thirsty for new home product because the traditional resell product simply hasn't been available. So I suspect if the existing home market is activated as interest rates do trend down, should they trend down, that it will result both in additional supply for the first-time buyer and additional demand for the move-up buyer. And we've been thinking a lot about that. And I think that we're very well prepared for that migration as well.
Alan Ratner: Great. Appreciate your thoughts on that topic. Second, on the margin, interesting. So you're not giving formal full year guidance, but I guess we can certainly piece together your expectations by you saying that you expect full year margins to be pretty similar to '23. So that would imply a fairly healthy ramp through the year. I was hoping you can just give us maybe specifics on what type of trajectory on incentives does that imply? I would imagine land costs are going to be trending up in terms of what's flowing through the P&L. So should we just interpret that as your expectation that incentive should come down 200, 300-plus basis points over the course of the year from where they sit today?
Stuart Miller: So if you go back to the days when seasonality was the norm, and we went on the seasonality hiatus for a period of time, that was always the case. The trajectory of our margin started lower in the first quarter and accelerated through the year. And I think Diane detailed that in her comments. That's all -- that has been the case. I think that in our case, specifically, as we went through the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter was a pretty rugged interest rate quarter, especially as we went through the first couple of months. And so I think that you have kind of an anomalous margin push down in our first quarter. I think that you're going to see a normal flow of margin improvement as we go through the year. I think the more extreme incentivization in the fourth quarter to maintain pace was -- it looks today as if it's really a thing of the past at that level. And as we look at where our margin is likely to go, I think we have pretty good visibility because we went through November and then early December and seeing the market kind of ease up and the buyers come back to the market as interest rates did start to ease. Jon, do you want to weigh in on that?
Jon Jaffee: Yeah, I would agree with what you said, Stuart. In addition, we did see as we moved into sort of the holiday season at the end of the quarter, less of a rebound as interest rates came down due to holiday seasonality, which is sort of normal. I also think that we should expect that the real focus on not just the fact that rates are lower, but more effective use of adjustable rates in order to bring down the cost of mortgage buydowns. The buyer still is in need of a lower effective interest rate to both qualify and afford homes at today's prices.
Alan Ratner: Great. Thanks again guys. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, Alan.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kenneth Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Zener: Good morning, everybody.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Kenneth Zener: A key part of even flow cadence is structuring land as a variable cost. I think, a very meaningful innovation for you guys. But can you quantify what percent of your closings have been coming from these finished homesites that average 85% to 90% of your purchases this year? So how much -- what percent of the closings came from these finished homesites in the quarter? If you could give us some context, that would be useful versus last year or earlier this year. And then this is the key question, quantify the margin impact that you're making versus the asset efficiency that you're achieving? Because I think the latter point is misunderstood. That's my first question. Thank you.
Diane Bessette: Well, can I just jump in? So in the fourth quarter, about 48% of our deliveries were on in some sites that we purchased from third parties. I don't know what it was at the beginning of the year, but I'm sure it turns it up every quarter, and I think that we should expect to see that trending up in 2024 as we continue to become even more land lighter, reducing land on our balance sheet and having more control.
Stuart Miller: There was a second part to…
Kenneth Zener: Right. The margin impact versus the asset efficiency.
Diane Bessette: Yeah. So I think if you look big picture, it’s a growing number, but I would say that it's probably 20 or 30 basis points is probably a good [indiscernible] and that will probably grow as we increase that percentage. But [indiscernible] about 20 or 30 basis points.
Kenneth Zener: Excellent. And then I think the second item, and I think this is more about messaging, and we've spoken about this in the past, but investors are seeking clarity on net income to cash flow and buybacks. I realize your company is evolving as you reduce your land exposure, but just generally as a heuristic, could you kind of inform the statement, I think, Diane, you might have said this, actually, that the balance of cash flow will go to share repurchases absent debt payments. Is that a simple rule of thumb that is guiding your company? And Stuart, I think you were highlighting that you're not looking for large land deals. So I think with the simple heuristic people would have more confidence in that application of your cash flow. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Yeah, I think that's a good characterization for right now. But what I'm trying to articulate is that we are evolving our thinking in this regard. I want to say emphatically that we're not looking for and holding back for large land deals. We're not looking for and holding back for M&A transactions. So let's say that that's not the direction that we're going right now. And that the cash flow generated [Technical Difficulty] conservatively right now, allocation between debt retirement as debt comes due and the remainder for stock buyback.
Diane Bessette: And I think, Ken, I would also just add as it relates to that, you might be referring to the fact that in prior quarters and prior years, we did a fair amount of early redemption on our future senior notes. And obviously, because we really want to -- I've always said that while the debt to total capital ratio is important, I think what's perhaps more important in my mind, there's a little been nominal dollars on your balance sheet. And so we really wanted to take down the nominal dollars [indiscernible] And now we’re at $2.5 billion. It feels like there isn't quite a need to keep pulling debt forward. We can just kind of pay it down in an orderly fashion as it becomes due. So that's what I was thinking about it at the moment.
Kenneth Zener: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, or I guess, almost good afternoon. Thanks for all the comments so far. And also, congrats on the fast turnaround after year-end. That is very impressive. So I would agree with Diane's comments earlier. I wanted to first zero in a little bit on SG&A and corporate G&A for the first quarter. It looks like you're having revenue growth expectations alongside the -- predominantly driven by the higher closings. But negative leverage, I guess, on both metrics by a pretty decent margin given the double-digit revenue growth outlook. So I just want to understand the drivers of that. I know you said on the corporate G&A, there's more investments. So maybe just talking a little bit more on SG&A. If there's higher commissions or other factors that we should be aware of? And on a full year basis, should we expect SG&A and corporate G&A leverage outside of just this first quarter dynamic?
Diane Bessette: Yeah. So I think, Mike, as we've been articulating, we have been seeing a little bit more broker participation as sales have been a little challenging at certain times, we've been utilizing brokers judiciously, certainly using tiered programs and the like to ensure that we are capturing sales, but spending dollars judiciously. Additionally, as you heard us talk about, the machine, a very big part of that is the lead generation on the digital side, how do you get more leads into the funnel so that we have higher conversion rates. And so we've been, again, judiciously spending dollars on that spend because we believe that in the end, that will really produce a higher net margin for us because it's less costly than brokers or other things. So I think those are the two areas that have really been impacting our SG&A in the last few quarters.
Stuart Miller: Yeah. Well, that was that was a great articulation of the operational side, but that's good, Diane. But the fact is that as we've gone through this, the ups and downs of the past year with interest rates, the use of our digital platform has really been a learning curve and has challenged us to get better and better and better. And while we have great affection for and engagement with our realtor community, we certainly don't want to incur costs that we don't have to incur. And so we have been working carefully to make sure we're managing the balance between the necessary engagement with realtors and what we can actually accomplish organically through our digital platform, and that is rippling through our SG&A. We've seen the realtor spend and some of the marketing spend tick up as we have driven to maintain sales pace. So we're seeing some of that. It's going to be a story of evolution as we go through 2024. Anything you want to add to that, Jon?
Jon Jaffee: I think that's the right articulation as you said in your opening remarks, Stuart, we're continuing to learn about the execution of our machine. And as we turn the dials, whether it's interest rate buy downs or incentives or the flow through our digital funnel or the selectiveness of brokers, we're in that stage where we are trying, learning, experimenting and providing the feedback to how we get better and more efficient at each of those levers that we pull to drive this consistent production and sales pace.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thank you for that. I guess secondly, just drilling down a little bit more on the gross margins and understanding it's a pretty fluid situation, certainly. But against kind of a backdrop where you've done low 24% gross margins in the back half of '23, now you're talking about low 21% in the first quarter, but perhaps the full year getting back to something around what you did on a full year basis in '23, it would seem like this upcoming first quarter, obviously you took steps to ensure volume and orders coming in the door that appear to be maybe, I don't want to say extraordinary, but you did what you needed to do, let's say, to ensure those volumes coming through at maybe a little bit more of a stress period. Is it fair to kind of think about perhaps a 200 basis point or 200 to 300 basis points this type of first quarter deviation as being kind of -- I don't want to say a onetime event. But as you have the more recent interest rate backdrop coming back to late summer, and where you did a gross margin closer to that 24%, is there any reason not to think that you'll be getting back to that 23%, 24% type of gross margin and relatively short order outside of, again, perhaps some more aggressive measures that you took from an [Technical Difficulty] that are kind of tangible and quantifiable that you see as more of just affecting the first quarter. Is that kind of the right way to think about kind of moving past this period in the very short term?
Stuart Miller: So it's a great question, Mike, and it's one that we're thinking a lot about. And I think that the answer to that is we'll see, but it is our instinct that, that is very much the case. As I noted in the fourth quarter, you really saw as interest rates started to migrate above 7.5% towards 8%, as I said in my remarks, it really felt like you were hitting an inflection point where you really felt in the field that the buyers were maybe starting to hit a tipping point of losing some confidence. The way I think about it is as we've gone through this time of higher interest rates, even as we saw a sharp increase in interest rates at the inception, we were able to see incentives work. The incentives were able to help the buyer get to a point of affordability, and they transacted on the need for their housing. As we got into the fourth quarter, they were starting to get to that point where we weren't sure that incentives, even on the aggressive side, we're going to work. Time went on, interest rates started to moderate just a little bit, not kind of as they did in the past couple of days, but just that moderation took kind of the edge off. And maybe the market needed to get to a new normal. I don't know what that was actually going to be. But the question is -- the answer to your question is we did what we had to do. We did what it took to activate the market at the moment in time. We're not going to build inventory. We are not going to pull back on the overriding strategy, we're driving cash flow. We're going to meet the market where the market is, and we're going to drive through it. And that's exactly what we did through our fourth quarter. You're right that some of the margin impact might be a bit more severe as we reflect that through the first quarter and there could well be a kind of snap back and we'll have to wait and see because we are going through the seasonality of this time of the year right now.
Jon Jaffee: Stuart, if I could add, as you think about the machine and the process that we've been describing to you for quarters now, it's really a reflection of the reality that none of us have a crystal ball at any moment in time to see which way rates or buyer enthusiasm is moving. So as we sat in the fourth quarter, we just dealt with the rate for what they were versus a speculation of where they might go. And so as Stuart just articulated, we appropriately used mortgage rate buydowns to keep a pace going. As we sit here today, rates look better. But again, we don't know where they're going, but we're well positioned to just maintain that pace, which by definition means we would use lower-cost mortgage buydowns, continue to drive the consistent pace. So as Stuart articulated, we'll use our margin as a sharp absorber given market conditions, interest rate environments, and you should see it move up and down as the market moves up and down.
Stuart Miller: One last thing I'll say is, an interesting anomaly that we noted through our fourth quarter was, there was a greater reluctance to use an ARM product that would normally take place as we go through an interest rate cycle and much more focus on a 30-year fixed buy down, which was more expensive. And just a small tick or normalization of interest rates, and especially what's happened over the past days, really is migrating the attention of buyers through the prospect of an ARM product being more acceptable. This, of course, reduces the amount of incentive that's flowing through the system. And so we're going to have to wait and see. Again, it's [touching the feed] (ph) day-by-day basis, and that's what we're working on. Why don't we take one more question?
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari: Thank you for squeezing me in. Good afternoon. My first question is just building on your comments in response to the last question, which is as you think about coming into the year with less than one finished spec per community, which is low and especially relative to maybe some of your peers that are in sort of similar product price points market, how do you think about the ability to leverage the improvements in the Lennar machine to flex the business to get to the 80,000 closing that you've guided to or to even perhaps flex up or flex down relative to that number depending on how the market comes together this year?
Stuart Miller: Look, to that extent, everything that we are doing, even the migration to the larger number of deliveries is by design. It's about the number of communities that we have and the pace through those communities. And this is becoming very much a focused detailed program that is managed by Jon with what we call our daily call, it actually every other day, and our operating group is laser-focused on production pace, starts pace, cycle times dovetailing with sales pace at the division and community level. This is being handled on a very active hands-on basis. Jon you want to?
Jon Jaffee: Just as you said, Stuart, the by design approach is to not have completed inventory, which have new inventory moving through our production machine, which we don't need to flex up or down, it will consistently come through and will consistently drive deliveries towards our goal of about 80,000 for this year. So the market conditions will ebb and flow most likely, but our machine will be very consistent through that delivering by design target that we have.
Susan Maklari: Okay. And then in your comments, you detailed some really impressive market share gains that you've realized over the course of the year. As you think about the forward year, can you talk a bit to maybe who those share gains you think largely came from? And then the ability to further outgrow the market as you drive some of these company-specific initiatives?
Stuart Miller: So we're certainly not going to be naming names, and it's different across the platform. And I don't think you would even be able to identify a specific where it came from. I would say every market is different, every strategy in various markets for the competitive landscape has been different. Remember that there are some numbers that have been constrained by access to capital. There have been others that just have a very different strategy. Our strategy has been clear and consistent and where there has been pull back by one another or a group of other builders. We've winged in, we’ve built certain voids and picked up market share in that process, whether it's been a land acquisition, whether it's been in the acquisition of new trade partners to help focus on cycle time and help bring costs into focus or whether it's been in accelerating sales or sales pace, we've been able across the board to lean in and drive market share.
Jon Jaffee: I think the market share, the position is a byproduct of the strategy as you're hearing, it's becoming the most efficient, effective buyer of choice from Lennar sellers and the most efficient, effective builder choice for our trade partners. That's what really drives our strategy and it produces, other builders pull back or maybe accelerate will provide us consistent growth, that consistent volume to both Lennar sellers and to our trade partners.
Susan Maklari: Okay. [Technical Difficulty]
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you very much. We're going to end it there. I want to say thanks everybody for joining us. It's been a really exciting year for our company in terms of evolution, in terms of execution and in terms of learning curve and look forward to reporting on progress through 2024. Thanks for joining.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect your line, and please enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-09-15 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for the reading of the forward-looking statement.
David Collins: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Pardon me, I've got a bit of a cold, so you'll hear that in my voice. I cough a little. So, today, I'm in Miami, together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. We're all here in Miami together. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company and our performance. After my introductory remarks, Jon is going to give some color on overall market conditions. He is going to comment on our land position and then he is going to give an operational overview, updating supply chain, cycle time and construction costs. And as usual, Diane is going to give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for the fourth quarter and year-end 2023 to assist in forward-thinking and modeling. And then, we'll answer as many questions as we can, and please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up as usual. Now, as you all know, since our last earnings call, Rick Beckwitt retired effective the end of the third quarter. Rick began his 17 years with Lennar at the very beginning of the Great Recession, as it's called, in 2006. He rejoined an industry that was operating at the top of its game and was prepared to reach for even higher heights. Rick found himself, however, in an industry that was caught in a changing and devolving economic environment that altered expectations and aspirations. Rick jumped in at Lennar and treated problems as his own side-by-side with the rest of the team. And over the next years, he worked as part of the team fixing what was broken and righting what was upside-down. He became best partners with me and with Jon Jaffe, and together, we navigated difficult times. We positioned Lennar for future success and began anew to reach for new heights, and we achieved the extraordinary. All of us at Lennar appreciate Rick's service and partnership. We all benefited from his experience in the industry, his natural intellect and the camaraderie that we all shared. We all reach that inevitable moment of retirement, but it is uncommon for that moment to coincide with the timing when the company is well prepared as well. This is that real moment. As a team of three, Rick, Jon and I worked together and as partners with the rest of the Lennar operating leaders to lift and position Lennar for leadership in the industry. Lennar today is both organized and positioned financially to move forward with a smaller organization structure and more efficient overhead. Rick completed 17 years of service and retired as Co-CEO and President. Rick, I know you're out there. I know you're on the call and listening, because I know you just can't help yourself. I hope you're preparing to sharpen your golf game or building some wood cabinet in Maine. Rest assured that all is well and stable, and we are executing as expected here at Lennar. So now, let me turn to the business at hand and talk about the business of Lennar and how we are performing, as well as how we are positioned for our future. So, let me begin by saying that we're pleased to report that the Lennar team has -- excuse me, has remained focused on balancing and maintaining production and sales pace, reducing cycle time and increasing cash flow, improving inventory turn and driving strong bottom line. And we have again produced a strong and consistent result for the quarter. Our third quarter results reflect consistent adherence to the core operating strategies that we have detailed in prior quarters against the backdrop of an evolving macroeconomic environment and a constructively configured housing landscape. As I noted in our press release, the macroeconomic environment is constructive relative to the housing -- homebuilding market, and it has certainly stabilized relative to the aggressive interest rate climb that defined the environment last year. It seems that we have entered a phase of more measured adjustments in order to curtail inflation, while the Fed shrinks its balance sheet by approximately $100 billion per month and engages other mechanisms to reduce capital in the market. Over these time -- over time, these steps will hopefully bring inflation to desired levels. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in a more orderly fashion. And while the Fed is working to reduce overall capital levels, the elimination of sharp turns and aggressive moves is generally constructive to consumers finding access to enough capital for their necessities, and housing is a necessity. Against that backdrop, the current housing market is generally defined by a very short supply of affordable products and strong demand for affordable products. The consumers have now adjusted to and accepted "higher for longer" interest rates and are willing to purchase or rent what they can afford. The consumer is employed and is confident they will remain employed and likely with a higher wage. Higher rates, with need driving demand and housing in short supply, is the new normal, and the consumer understands that the cost of housing will likely continue to be higher. Generally speaking, strong demand for housing has returned within the limits of affordability. The market has attracted consumers by adjusting prices, increasing incentives, including rate buy-downs, and driving down production costs in order to enable consumers to afford needed shelter, and customers have responded. The net price of homes has moderated, and the net average sales prices have stabilized. We've seen in our numbers that net average sales prices on home closings have dropped approximately 10% or 11% from the peak of approximately $500,000 in 2022 to approximately $448,000 now, and we expect that pricing to remain fairly constant. Concurrently, multi-family rental rates have also moderated. Two years of 500,000 apartment starts per year are now being delivered and creating supply increases, and in some geographies, excess supply, which are moderating rental rates. While we expect a sharp drop-off in new starts this year, we don't expect that rents will drop too significantly, but they are not likely to grow very much either in the foreseeable future. Rentals and rent equivalents make up a significant part of the CPI calculation. Overall, we believe that the housing market has leveled, and while net average sales prices are lower, cancellations have been normalizing and margins have stabilized, as cost reductions and value engineering provide an offset to the price reductions. Additionally, we believe that the new supply of homes will be limited as developed land is scarce and increasingly more expensive to develop. This will continue to limit available inventory and maintain supply-demand imbalance. Bottom line, the economy is constructive, housing supply is short and limited, demand has returned to affordable offerings, and builders will need to continue to produce more homes to fill the void. So against that backdrop, the Lennar team has remained focused on our core strategies that are driving our company forward. First, we continue to remain production and volume focused with a primary focus on driving production efficiency, driving higher inventory turn, driving higher cash flow and strong margins, and while focusing on return on assets. At the same time, we maintain a carefully matched sales pace, using our digital marketing and dynamic pricing machine to keep production pace and sales pace closely matched. In our third quarter, we started 18,675 homes, while we sold 19,666 homes, and we delivered 18,559 homes, or an 8% increase over the last year. Our starts pace for the quarter was 4.9 homes per community per month, while our sales pace was 5.2 homes per community per month. While these numbers don't fit perfectly together, they are getting closer every quarter, and we're operating our platform more tightly than ever and by careful design. Our digital marketing and dynamic pricing machine helps drive our net sales pace to exceed our available starts, enabling us to backfill cancellations, which ran last quarter at a 3.3% rate. And we maintain a very controlled inventory level as a result, and that is just over one home per community. This has driven the confidence to continue a consistent start pace that enables operating efficiency. With this focus, we've continued to sell homes at current market prices, improving margins as conditions improve and reducing margins when necessary. Accordingly, our margins bottomed in the first quarter of this year at 21.2%. And as the market has improved, margins have recovered to now 24.4% this quarter, and we're expecting flat to modest improvement next quarter with a range of 24.4% to 24.6%. Of course, through all phases of the market cycle, we are consistently producing very strong cash flow. These elements of execution are working extremely well and improving. And accordingly, we've gained confidence in our ability to now guide to increased volume for the year of almost 71,000 to almost 72,000 deliveries with strong margins and strong cash flow. Next strategy, we've continued to work with our trade partners to maintain our now properly configured cost structure relative to the current sales price environment, while we continue to drive cycle time to pre-supply chain crisis levels. Jon will cover these production components in more detail shortly, but Jon and our purchasing team have been laser-focused across the platform. We were quick to reduce cost as the market corrected, and we have held costs down as the market has stabilized. And considerable success in this area is reflected in our margin improvement and as well as in the number of homes we will construct -- that were construction-ready and available for delivery this quarter. Our third strategy has been to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions, as well as land and land bank strategy. While Jon will give additional detail on land, this has been a specific concentrated focus across the platform in every division to refine our approach to reducing land exposure and continuing to become increasingly asset-light. We've made some significant progress in reducing land held on balance sheet with now just 1.5 years owned and 73% of our land controlled. We have made exceptional progress in creating a materially more efficient manufacturing platform. Accordingly, our land programs and partners have become strategic partners in maintaining volume and increasing market share, while helping to rationalize costs. Our fourth core focus and strategy has been to manage our operating costs or our SG&A, so that even at lower gross margins, we will continue to drive a strong net margin. While we've been driving our SG&A down over the past years quarter-by-quarter to new record lows and many of those changes, although not all, are hardwired into permanent efficiencies in operation, there are some components that have grown as we've seen in this quarter, and we've had to address interest rate movements -- as we have had to address interest rate movements and sometimes more difficult market conditions. Examples are realtor costs and marketing expenses, which have had to expand as customer acquisition and engagement have become sometimes more challenging. Both of these areas saw increases in our third quarter numbers. Nevertheless, we were able to achieve a very respectable 7% SG&A this quarter, which is higher than last quarter's 6.7%. But it is -- excuse me, but it did nevertheless result in a strong net margin of 17.4%, which is up from 15.8% last quarter. We've continued to streamline our business even as we grow so that we can accomplish more with less. And as an example, many have asked if we'll need to replace Rick as he's now retired. And the answer simply is, no, because we've built systems that are now in place that enable us to operate in ways today that would not have worked in past years. Our fifth playbook strategy was to maintain tight inventory control in order to control our asset base. The Lennar machine of digital marketing, sales management and dynamic pricing has materially improved inventory control by enabling a focus on selling homes in inventory, focusing maximum attention on underperforming communities, and bringing attention to product and plans that are not selling as expected. Clearing the homes that are complete and closable rather than selling homes that are many quarters in the future is exactly what drives cash flow, higher inventory turns and higher returns on assets, and we're focused on this part of the business every day. Both land and home inventory control is the mission control of our overall business. And in our third quarter numbers, you can see continuing quarterly improvement in our now 11.5% debt-to-total capitalization, down from 13.3% last quarter and down from 15% last year this time. Additionally, with our $3.9 billion cash position, our net-debt to total capital is actually negative, and our balance sheet is being carefully managed to provide extraordinary liquidity and flexibility. These elements of the business continue to be managed through an every other day management meetings where the numbers are reviewed at the regional and divisional levels by the entire management team. Sales, starts and closings are maintained and controlled, balanced [indiscernible] with the end result of volume with defined expectations. The sixth playbook strategy was to continue to focus on cash flow and bottom-line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. If we reflect on our third quarter results, not only did we accomplish excellent cash flow and bottom-line results earning over $1.1 billion or $3.87 per share, but we used cash to repurchase $366 million of stock and we also repaid approximately $475 million of senior debt. We expect to continue to generate considerable earnings and cash flow, and accordingly, we'll continue to retire debt and purchase stock opportunistically. Let me say in conclusion that our third quarter 2023 has been another excellent quarter for Lennar. We saw overall market conditions remain constructive for our industry, as aggressive interest rate moves subsided and the new-normal-defined expectations. Additionally, the housing market has continued to be defined by housing shortage and generally strong demand that is prepared to transact. Accordingly, we executed on our core strategies against the economic and industry backdrop. Given consistent execution, we are extremely well positioned for continued success, as strong demand for affordable offering continues to [indiscernible] the current short supply. We expect to finish out this year strong, and we also expect to enter 2024 with a 10% initial growth expectation, and we're very well positioned to achieve that level. We engaged the changing tides of the past year with a consistent strategy that enabled certainty of execution throughout our company. The strategy is well-known and understood throughout our division offices, and we have a simple and consistent model of execution. We focus on maintaining volume, while we price our homes to drive match pace. We work with our trade base to manage costs and efficiencies and adjust our product offering to meet the market. We manage both land and our production inventories to drive efficiency, cash flow and returns on our asset base. We focus on land-light model in order to drive balance sheet efficiency. Finally, we fortify our balance sheet to have liquidity for strength and flexibility. Knowing what to do and executing per plan has driven this quarter's success and ensures consistent success for the foreseeable future. As we look ahead to a successful fourth quarter and year-end 2023 and into 2024, we are positioned for and expect to see much of the same as we go forward. We are confident that we'll continue to grow, perform and drive Lennar to new levels of performance. Thank you. And with that, let me turn over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Stuart. Good morning, everyone. As Stuart noted, the housing market is healthy overall, as supply remains tight, demand remains strong and buyers have become more comfortable with higher mortgage rates. In our third quarter, we continued to offer a combination of attractive pricing and compelling mortgage rate programs to capture that demand. Our price-to-market strategy reflects our balance sheet-first focus, so we can maintain starts and sales, increase market share, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going. The execution of our pricing strategy is based on the strength [indiscernible] market matched against the level of production we have in that market is done on a community-by-community basis. In the current environment, all of our markets are benefiting from greater demand than supply. And while some markets like in Florida or the Carolinas are stronger than others, we were able to achieve our desired sales pace in all our markets. In our third quarter, the majority of our markets had a higher sales pace in Q3 compared to Q2 and also used higher incentives in Q3, along with an increase in marketing and broker spend. In all markets, our homebuilding teams worked closely with Lennar Mortgage to find the right solution for each buyer to help fulfill their desire to purchase. Our sales strategy of finding market clearing pricing is designed to match the pace of homes under construction, which in turn gives us confidence to maintain a consistent pace of starts. This consistent start pace is the foundation for our production-first strategy. As we continuously improved the way we execute this game plan, we have grown our trade base, maintained lower construction costs and reduced cycle time. These improvements enabled our third quarter starts to increase 17% from the prior year. Continued focus on our production-first strategy has enhanced Lennar's position as the builder of choice for trades. Our existing trade partners are increasing their business with Lennar, while our approach is also attracting new trades. This increase in access to trade, combined with a normalized supply chain, led to a significant improvement in our third quarter cycle time. For the quarter, cycle time decreased by 32 days sequentially from Q2. Progress is difficult to measure precisely as product mix changes, but we are clearly on a path to getting back to pre-pandemic cycle times, expect to continue to see improvement in the fourth quarter and into 2024. Looking at our third quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q2 by about 5%. In addition, our Q3 costs were down about 4% on a year-over-year basis. This was down significantly from the 8% year-over-year increase we saw in Q2. Again, this is the trajectory of cost reduction we guided to last quarter. Looking forward, you can expect Lennar to be focused on plan and SKU reductions, value engineering to further reduce costs, and introducing additional workforce housing communities in many markets across our platform. I would like to conclude with our land-light strategy and community count. In our third quarter, we continued to effectively work with our strategic land and land bank partners where they purchase land on our behalf and then deliver just-in-time finished homesites to our homebuilding machine. In the third quarter, about 85% of our $1.5 billion land acquisition was finished homesites purchased from various land structures. We have made significant progress again in the third quarter, as our years' supply of owned homesites improved to 1.5 years from 2.2 years and our controlled homesite percentage increased to 73% from 79% year-over-year, respectively. The reduction in cycle time and reduction in owned land will increase cash flow, as well as help improve inventory turn, which now stands at 1.3 versus 1.1 last year, an 18% increase. Our community count at the end of the third quarter was 1,253, which is up 5% from the year-ago period, and we expect to increase our community count in the high-single digits by the end of fiscal 2023 from 2022. The strategies of our sales pace matching production pace, which leads to lower cycle times and construction costs, combined with the asset-light focus, which leads to the reduction of owned land, are reducing risk, improving returns and strengthening the balance sheet for Lennar. I want to recognize and thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in focusing on these strategies and for delivering a solid third quarter. I'd now like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So, Stuart and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our Homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our Financial Services operations and our balance sheet and then provide guidance for Q4 2023. So starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our Financial Services team had operating earnings of $148 million. Looking at the details, mortgage operating earnings were $111 million compared to $64 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by higher locked volume as a result of higher orders and capture rates and higher profit per locked loan as a result of lower cost per loan, as the team continues to focus on efficiencies, and additionally, higher secondary margins. Title operating earnings were $37 million compared to earnings of $33 million, which excludes a $36 million one-time charge due to a litigation accrual in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and a decrease in cost per transaction, as the team continues to focus on using technology to increase productivity. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our Homebuilding and Financial Services teams. They truly operate under the banner of One Lennar. So, now turning to the balance sheet. This quarter, once again, we were steadfast in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by maintaining production and pricing homes to market to deliver as many homes as possible to meet housing demand. The drumbeat also continued with our determination to preserve cash and increase asset efficiency. The end result of these actions was that we ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash and had no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total liquidity of $6.5 million and great -- sorry, and great financial flexibility for the future. As a result of our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we made significant progress on our goal of becoming land-lighter. At quarter-end, our homesites controlled increased to 73% from 69% in the prior year, and our years owned improved to 1.5 years from 2.2 years in the prior year, our highest controlled percentage and our lowest years owned in our history. Jon mentioned, we spent approximately $1.5 billion on land purchases this quarter, however, about 85% were finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. At quarter-end, we owned 107,000 homesites and controlled 284,000 homesites for a total of 391,000 homesites. We believe this portfolio provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. During the quarter, we started about 18,700 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 43,600 total homes in inventory. This inventory number includes about 2,000 models and also includes about 1,400 homes that were completed unsold as we successfully managed our finished inventory level. In our continued effort to further strengthen and de-risk our balance sheet by reducing our debt balances, we retired $425 million aggregate principal of our 5.875% senior notes due in November 2024 and repurchased about $50 million of senior notes also due in fiscal 2024, all at or below par. We repaid about $6.1 billion of senior notes over the last two years, which equates to more than $330 million of annual interest savings. As a result of our debt reduction initiatives, we ended the quarter with a total senior note balance just under $3 billion, which was less than our cash balance of almost $4 billion. The net senior note maturity of $378 million is due in December 2023. Combined with strong earnings, our Homebuilding debt to total capital was 11.5% at quarter-end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 15% in the prior year. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 3 million of our shares totaling $366 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 7 million shares totaling $763 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $107 million during the quarter. So, in total, we returned almost $1 billion to all our investors this quarter, our equity holders and our debt holders. And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to almost $26 billion. Our book value per share increased to just over $90. Our return on inventory was 26%, and our return on equity was 16%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we come to the end of 2023 and head into 2024. So with that brief overview, let's turn to guidance, starting with new orders. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 16,200 to 17,200 homes as we match sales with production. And as Jon mentioned, we expect our Q4 ending inventory count to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range year-over-year. We anticipate our Q4 deliveries to be in the range of 21,500 to 22,500 homes. This would bring our annual delivery to be in the range of 70,800 to 71,800, which is an increase of 7% to 8% year-over-year. Our Q4 average sales price will be approximately flat with Q3, as we continue to price to market and offer incentives to match affordability. We expect gross margins to be in the range of 24.4% to 24.6%, and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.9%, as we continue to focus on maintaining sales and production paces. And for the combined Homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $25 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q4 to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million. And we expect a loss of about $20 million for our Multifamily business and a loss of approximately $25 million for the Lennar Other category. The Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustment to our public technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.1% of total revenues, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 281 million shares. So, when you pull all that together, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.40 to $4.75 per share for the fourth quarter. And finally, as Stuart mentioned, as we think about 2024, our initial growth expectation is currently 10%. And so, therefore, we look forward to another very successful year. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Truman Patterson: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, Diane, thanks for clarifying that at the end, the '24 growth target of about 10%. But looking at your fourth quarter guide, you had very strong third quarter orders. Just trying to understand that fiscal fourth quarter order guide down about 15% sequentially. Was that really due to the healthy third quarter selling, where you reduced your spec availability and kind of internal inventory positioning going into the fourth quarter? Is it just normal seasonality? Does it imply a modest deceleration in the consumer, given the recent rate move? Just hoping you can help us unpack that.
Stuart Miller: Sure. Thanks, Truman. Yes, you're right to tie those together. The fact is that as we enter the fourth quarter, which is seasonally a more quieter time of the year. We did have very strong third quarter sales. We do expect to see strength in the fourth quarter. But seasonality has returned to some extent. And additionally, we've seen interest rates pick up again. So, we're just moderating our view of where the fourth quarter goes and making sure that as we come into the fourth quarter, we're well positioned to achieve exactly what we said.
Jon Jaffe: And I'll just add, Truman, that it's all part of our process to have a design sales pace so that matches the production coming out of our assembly line out in our communities.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then, I thought Rick was going to be on this call to congratulate him on retirement, but since he can't defend himself, maybe we should just air our grievances against him. But look, just big picture, how are the two of you, Jon, Stuart, just kind of dividing responsibilities given Rick's retirement?
Stuart Miller: Well, listen, we have very comfortably streamlined the business. Jon is overseeing operations across the country at this point, and he has been doing that for some time now. And what has happened over the past years is, our regional presidents and our operators have just really stepped up and have become far more self-sufficient, driven by some of the technology support that we've created across the platform. There's just a very orderly program of operations as we go forward that is guided by Jon on a regular basis in combination between what we call our daily call, it's actually every other day, and additionally, our operations review meetings, which we're kind of in the middle of right now. We begin at the beginning of each quarter. Jon goes to some. I go to some. But we are present, we are engaged, we are involved in kind of level setting our divisional focus across the platform. And Jon and I have comfortably shared responsibility for about 40 years. I think we've kind of been stepping in tune with doing that. We'll be able to comfortably do that right now.
Jon Jaffe: Yes, I think that can't be underestimated, the familiarity of working together for 40 years and managing the business across the country. But I think starting on the key point, which is we're a different company today. The efficiencies that we're driving in large part are because we've become much simpler, particularly at the land acquisition standpoint. You remember, we used to have a lot of complex joint ventures. We used to speculate more on land. Today, we're a very efficient buyer of finished homesites from some strategic land partnerships and strategic land banks. And that really fuels the front-end of a machine that is very orderly and very focused in today's world for Lennar.
Truman Patterson: Perfect. Thank you, all.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you, Truman.
Operator: Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is, Stuart, you mentioned that you continue to expect to see growth next year even with the meaningful strides that you've made over the last several quarters in there. When you think about the construction -- the production constraints in the industry though, can you talk to how you think you can add capacity in this kind of an environment? And any thoughts on how to think about 2024 from a volume perspective?
Stuart Miller: So look, as we've looked at 2024, it's not so much about adding production at this point. We are positioned for a very strong 2024 right now. We have the land. We have it identified. It is under contract or in our pipeline. It is under development. 2024 at this point, except for the overall sales environment, is pretty much embedded in our system. So, we have pretty good visibility at this point. We keep talking about selling and building and programming by process. And by process, we just have great visibility into what we're able to produce for 2024. And in fact, if you look at our kind of five-year land planning and overall production schedules, we have pretty good visibility even beyond. Now, the question is, what's the market going to do and how is the market going to react? We are going to continue to price to market conditions. We are an operating -- manufacturing platform that is going to price to market. And if the market moves a little bit, you're going to see our margins be, as I said before, the shock absorber. So, when we talk about a projection of growth for 2024, we have pretty good certainty that we can accomplish that. And how the market unfolds in these kinds of uncertain times where interest rates are moving, the Fed is clearly trying to take liquidity out of the system, we're going to wait and see how it actually evolves. But our target right now is in that low-double digit level of growth for 2024. And we think it's achieve -- we know it's achievable. We'll see how the market performs.
Jon Jaffe: And Susan, you asked about our production capacity. That visibility Stuart speaks to, we clearly communicate that with our trade partners today about what is coming in the future quarters. So they're prepared and we're prepared as that production, as already in our system, will be coming online to be able to manage that volume.
Diane Bessette: And Susan, I guess I'd just add that 10%, low-double digits, that's from a volume perspective. We'll have to see how kind of margin and other items play out, but at least it gives you a perspective on the volume level.
Jon Jaffe: The target.
Diane Bessette: Target, yeah.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe building on that a bit, you've obviously talked a lot about thinking of the cash generation of the business and converting net income to cash flows. As you think about the go-forward and the environment that we're in and the increased agility in the business, what could that mean for cash generation next year? Any thoughts there?
Stuart Miller: Everything that we have done to reconfigure our business is focused on turning profitability into cash flow and making sure that we are generating a consistent level of cash coming in. And everything that we're underwriting right now, even if margin moves up or down to some extent as a moderator for where sales or interest rates might go, our cash flow is still going to be very, very strong as we go forward.
Susan Maklari: Okay. Great. Thank you for the color, and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Yeah, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate all the color, and congrats on the results. I did want to touch on the -- some of your longer-term comments. So first of all, not to get too granular, but in 2024, the closings number, we've observed that as cycle times have improved, you've been able to deliver more units or close more units than you've taken orders for. I was curious as you look into 2024, Diane, is it reasonable to think that you could likely close as many units as you take orders for? And then secondarily, you talked about -- I think, Stuart, you talked about return on assets as being an important metric for you. Curious if you could give us a sense for longer term, where you target your ROA as you look -- think about the business going forward?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So, we do think that as we sell, our delivery schedule is really tied pretty closely to -- given the fact that we are not selling way out in front, it's pretty much tied to how we're selling and the current sales pace. And so you can look at that today and see our operating machine really working. Sales and starts and closings are all working in close proximity to one another. In terms of return on assets, Steve, which is a great question, we have the difficulty of an asset base that just because of strong earnings and strong cash, it becomes a tougher and tougher hurdle. Our focus is on return on assets closer to 20%. So, it gets harder to achieve as we keep adding earnings and asset base to the program. And one could argue that we need to be buying back stock a little bit more aggressively. Diane and I talk about this all the time. And I'd say that we look at this opportunistically. Looks like today's stock price is getting even more attractive. So it's part of the program, but we are targeting in excess of a 20% return on assets.
Diane Bessette: Yes, I think that's right, Steve. You have to kind of make it a little bit more granular, right, as we focus on turning our inventory, as we focus on reducing our years of owned. Those are all helpful components, of course, to return on assets. And if we pair that with a consistent buyback program, which we have been consistent, the amounts may vary quarter-to-quarter, but we have a pretty consistent program. And I think that all bodes well in us achieving something over 20% as time goes on.
Stephen Kim: Yes, that's really helpful, and that's kind of where I was going to go next. So I appreciate you anticipating that.
Stuart Miller: We saw you coming.
Stephen Kim: Next question I have -- yeah, exactly. Next question I have relates to sort of market conditions and, in particular, the entry level of the market in light of the rate increase. So I would say -- my question is, in general, would you say that the move-up segment right now is performing a little stronger than entry level? And at the entry level, when we think of rate buy-downs, like what percent of your sales are using a rate buy-down? And are you going into the market buying -- making forward purchase commitments? And are you increasing the degree of rate buy-down relative to the prevailing rate? Or are you continuing to buy down that rate by about the same spread?
Stuart Miller: So, listen, as we've said, as rates move around, as demand moves around, we are tapping incentives up or down, we're maintaining pace. But the fact is that we haven't had to move dramatically in either direction as rates have moved currently. You asked whether it's the entry-level buyer or the move-up buyer that is doing better, frankly, there's strong demand across the platform. And in all segments, we are seeing strong demand out there. Affordability is kind of a question, and meeting the buyer where the affordability exists is kind of the trick of the market and getting it just right. And so, these are tweaks right now up and down. And of course, depending on where interest rates go, that is going to be the determinant of how much of an incentive has to be given or doesn't have to be given. And that's what we're kind of working our way through right now as you go through pricing. Jon, could you add to that?
Jon Jaffe: Yeah. Steve, you asked the question. We do buy forward commitments, but we do see even as interest rates fluctuate, the participation and those commitments stays very steady from the month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. And it's primarily used for our first-time buyers. And as you know, with our production model, it's very effective because we sell homes closer to being completed versus selling homes before they're started. So, we're able to lock-in our buyers, which is really important, because those buyers once they're locked-in aren't at risk to suddenly not qualifying if rates move on them. We keep the spread pretty consistent on an average, but obviously, we have to help our first-time buyers more than our move-up buyers. But because of our ability to do that and really manage it closely to our production pace, we don't really see a difference in the levels of demand from quarter-over-quarter, month-to-month between those buyer segments.
Stephen Kim: That's really helpful. Thanks very much, guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please go ahead.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Stuart, I hope you feel better. I have a question on dynamic pricing. I think it's fair to say, if we ran the tape last year, that using dynamic pricing allowed you to make -- find elasticity, make -- find homes at market clearing prices really quickly and across the platform quickly. So, if you look at the model today and look at sort of a histogram across your geographies and markets, where do you see pricing power? Where are things still weak? And do you effectively say more markets are stable than we have more markets where we're making a lot of adjustments up or down?
Jon Jaffe: Hey, Carl, it's Jon. In every market we are using closing costs, mortgage rate buy-downs, pricing to hit that desired pace. Clearly, we don't have to use it as much in, say, Florida, the Carolinas, parts of Texas, other markets around the country where there's immigration, strong job growth. In some markets, where you've seen a shift, in Austin, in Boise, parts of California, we have to use them a little bit more. But as I said earlier in my comments, we're able to achieve our desired pace by managing those levers with each individual buyer, at each community, home by home basis, to find the right monthly payment for them to deal with their mortgage qualification issues, get them locked into a loan, and to hit our production levels.
Carl Reichardt: Okay, thanks, Jon. And then, on SG&A, again, long-term strategy for the company has been to lower buyers' brokers' commissions, probably more aggressively than any other builder, at least that I cover. Market got weaker, buyers' brokers have come back. So, where does that strategy sit now in terms of your reliance on those brokers or your desire to continue to effectively disintermediate them or rely less on them? Thanks, all.
Stuart Miller: We pretty consistently said that the realtor community that supports the industry and that comes in and does the work of bringing customers to our sales center and actually engages the process is a friend of Lennar. And we're always trying to work with the realtor community. But at the same time, what we've tried to do is eliminate the friends and family component that is basically just giving away. So, we've done a pretty good job of creating a constructive relationship with the broker community while not overspending. And it migrates up and down as traffic is represented more and more by realtors. Now, of course, as the existing market has been more constrained, the realtors have been more focused on the new home market, and that means that we're getting a lot more traffic from the realtor community than we were getting when the existing market was more normalized. And with that said, you'll see our brokerage spend go up and down a little bit, which affects our SG&A.
Jon Jaffe: But it's all highlighted, it's at very low levels compared to our historical norms. And the way that we use the broker community is really just where we have completed inventory homes to move. We're very disciplined about what we make available to the broker community so that we maintain that focus and control of our SG&A.
Stuart Miller: And let me just say lastly, we've talked an awful lot about our digital sales funnel together with our dynamic pricing level and sales engagement. We are really striving to drive more and more of our customer engagement through our digital world where we access customers, meet them where they want to find us, and engage them very directly. That's where we think we can have the very best engagement with our customers. And so, we've talked about our digital sales machine. It's an important part of the way that we're creating a process around our sales program for the future, and it is evolving.
Carl Reichardt: I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Really strong results. Nice job. Stuart, first question. When you kind of talked about the net price declines in that kind of 10%, 11% range, historically, the typical spread between a new home and a resale, I believe, has been around 15%. I'm not sure you see it that way, but that's kind of what the data would show roughly. And we clearly haven't seen that level of price declines in the resale market, which it feels like to me when you compare the strengths we're seeing in the new home market today versus the resale market, I think there's a thesis out there, it's all inventory driven, but it feels like some of that historical spread is definitely narrowed this year as you and other builders have been more aggressive on pricing to market. So, when you think about that and you think about some of your other comments with your land cost is probably going to continue to rise, construction costs, while -- there's been progress made there, it's probably stable from this point forward. If you don't see resale prices rising, can you maintain that progress you've made this year as far as now closing that spread versus resale? Or do you see that spread returning just as a function of higher costs over time?
Stuart Miller: Well, I'll tell you, Alan, that you're kind of sitting in a very strange configuration of the housing market right now. The resale market is inventory very, very constrained. It's been well documented that interest rates rising as much as they have left existing homeowners with two assets. They have a home that is valuable and they have equity. They also have a mortgage that is at a very low interest rate and that also has great value. So, they're just not bringing existing homes to market as much as or at the rate that you would traditionally see. And that short supply of existing homes has enabled that part of the market to stay a little bit more robust in pricing as the new home market has used incentives to meet the market where affordability actually exists. So, that configuration is creating an anomaly in the way that existing homes and new homes are priced. I've said in the past that I still think that the existing home market is kind of a zero-sum game in terms of the supply and demand, because every time somebody sells an existing home, they go out and they have to buy another home. So, you add inventory, you subtract inventory. And I think that's kind of how that's configured. But from a pricing standpoint, I'm not surprised to see a little bit more parity between new and existing homes at this point. And yes, I think that we can continue on our trajectory depending on the overall macro environment, the interest rate environment. And where affordability is down, I think we can continue on our existing trajectory even as the existing home market remains relatively strong because of short supply.
Alan Ratner: Got it. That's helpful to hear your thoughts there. Second, I guess circling back to the ROA conversation, it has been a few quarters I think since you've talked publicly about the SpinCo plans and recognizing that's seemingly on hold for the time being, you still have about 10% of your assets right now not generating returns, which is clearly, I think, impacting the overall return calculation. So, just curious if you care to provide any updated thoughts on ways to monetize that more quickly, recognizing the capital markets may not be most advantageous right now.
Stuart Miller: Yeah, I think that you've laid it out well, that it has been some time, and the capital markets continue to be not very constructive for executing a plan. It does sit in the background, in the ring, and I think it's something that will come back into light at another point in time. It's very much at the front of our mind. We think about how we're going to configure some of those assets that can be positioned differently and there will be a moment in time when we come forward with a plan. It's not something that we've stopped thinking about. It is something that we've stopped talking about because we just don't think that the capital markets are constructive for a program right now.
Alan Ratner: Understood. Appreciate the update, guys. Thanks a lot.
Stuart Miller: Okay, next.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Ken Zener: Good afternoon, everybody.
Stuart Miller: Good afternoon.
Ken Zener: So, I have two questions. They might have some subparts to them, so bear with me. But first question is, broadly speaking, the prioritization of returns versus growth. And I ask, because this is basically a balance that you're striking between even flow and gross margins. So, first item is, it seems like even flow is in this 19,000 plus or minus range. The word even would suggest less variance in seasonality. So quarterly, I mean, do you think variance is, let's say, about 10% sequentially in that start number? Or how is your machine working? Because it's obviously not set to the larger variance of normal seasonality. And then, related to that, it doesn't appear that we're seeing your focus on pace affecting gross margins, right, at 24%. So, could you maybe kind of talk to that? I haven't heard you really talk about the dynamics of gross margins much, but the pace relative to the margins and what you think your start pace can be on a variance basis?
Stuart Miller: So, Ken, we've been fairly unapologetic about saying that pace is our core focus. We're looking at even flow. We're using even flow to drive efficiencies, whether it's in SG&A or whether it's in construction costs, you can expect, as we've said before, that, that consistent drumbeat of production is going to prevail and we're going to use margin as shock absorber or moderator to enable us to maintain production pace. Your numbers are by and large correct. There will be some adjustments for seasonality, which is anticipated. You see this in our fourth quarter projections or guidance. But with that said, you can expect that you're going to see an even flow production model that within boundaries, we recognize that if the market really moves dramatically one way or another, we'll adjust those production levels. But within boundaries, you're going to see us focus on that constant production pace, defining a constant sales pace.
Ken Zener: Okay. And then, the second question, I didn't hear the necessarily gross margin, which seems to be in a positive position versus your implied 20% return on capital. But the second question, and I think this is the most important issue that investors are overlooking for Lennar. Even flow tied to capital light, less capital intensities, 85% finished. Homesites acquired in the quarter, one-and-a-half years of land. If that were to fall to one year, which if you keep buying finished lots, it doesn't seem crazy, it's hypothetical, but one-and-a-half down to one year, that would be almost a third decline in land requirement on a land base of nearly $7 billion, equivalent to nearly $3 billion of decapitalization. I ask as EPS, right, as you get smoother, your EPS is increasingly going to be a cashflow metric, which affects valuation, but it also, right, if you're going to be generating earnings plus this $3 billion or so in land and whatever comes through WIP, it seems as though you will be forced into a systematic buyback program, which is an okay problem. I'm just thinking of some of your peers have gotten deeply into a negative leverage position. Is that something that you're thinking about avoiding and comment on the cash flow from less owned land? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Jon, did you want to add something?
Jon Jaffe: Yeah, just on the gross margin question, everything we're doing, as Stuart mentioned, is really driving to efficiencies. A big part of that efficiency is all aimed around how do we bring construction costs down for the benefit of affordability and for margins. And so, if we try to look at direct construction costs as percent of revenues, they are falling and that is helping support our margins even though we are aggressively managing the pace.
Stuart Miller: Okay. And to your more recent question, we think about the size of our stock buyback. We're very focused on continuing to drive cash flow. You are correct. Our land owned and controlled relationship is an area of focus. The year supply is very much an area of focus. You've seen these numbers migrate from much higher to the point that they're at now and we're not finished. We recognize that there will be an additional level of cash that comes into the company. We don't think it puts us in a bad position to end up with negative net to total cap -- negative net debt to total cap. And we recognize that we will continue to be cash generative. We fully expect that. We think that at year-end, we'll probably be in a better position than we are right now. And so, without projecting, let me say, that we are very focused on stock buyback and using our capital strategically to position the company well, to have flexibility, to have liquidity for the opportunities that might present themselves for us as markets kind of adjust. But at the same time, our stock buyback program is front and center of the way that we're thinking about our future.
Diane Bessette: And I guess I'd add, Ken, that just operationally we are focused on getting to the point where net income equals cash flow. We're not there yet, but it is a focus. And then, what we do with that capital -- cash flow is [indiscernible] answer, but I think it is a real goal for us to have those two equate. Not there yet, but it's a goal.
Ken Zener: Thank you so much.
Stuart Miller: Why don't we now take one last question.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from John Lovallo from UBS. Please go ahead.
John Lovallo: Hi, guys. Thank you for fitting me in here. Maybe the first one, just going back to the 10% growth target for next year, curious how you're thinking about community count in the context of that 10%. Are you expecting high-single digits, maybe low-double digits community count growth? Is this really going to be driven more by absorptions?
Stuart Miller: So, let me preface this by saying that community count is probably the most difficult part of the number in a projection to get right. So, whatever Jon is going to say about community count right now, I am saying this is not a projection, this is not guidance, this is just Jon answering your question.
Jon Jaffe: Thank you for that caveat. But it's very true, whether it's municipalities, litigation, it is the most challenging aspect to hit right on the timeline. But with that said, we have in place, as Stuart said earlier, a land pipeline that makes us very comfortable to target that 10%, that low-double digit growth. That will come from probably like a high-single digit community count and some increased absorption as we bring on more affordable workforce housing communities across our platform.
Stuart Miller: So, you can expect that our community count will grow. It will grow somewhere around where our growth expectations are generally. But it's not all about same store sales. Our business doesn't work perfectly that way. I'm not talking about Lennar's business, I'm talking about the new home business, it doesn't work perfectly that way. So, we expect our community count to grow.
John Lovallo: Understood. Okay. And then, maybe just going back quickly to Alan's question, if I can, on Quarterra. There's clearly economic uncertainty out there, but the capital markets do seem to be improving. I mean, there's even a homebuilder IPO out there in the market. I mean, have you guys dusted off the plans here at least on Quarterra? Is this something that could get back in motion here in the near term? Maybe any incremental thoughts there?
Stuart Miller: Well, the reality is we never really put it on the shelf. We've been working in the background on the way that we might or might not configure Quarterra. And so, it's not something to be dusted off. It's just at the right time, we will make the right move, something that works and dovetails with where we're going and how our company is configured. But we have to stop talking about it, because quarter-by-quarter we don't want to feel like we're missing expectations. We don't want to put something out there that just isn't right or doesn't feel right. One thing that I will say is that the opportunity to spin or to move off balance sheet some of our assets, we think is constructive for return on assets and some of the other calculations, we recognize that opportunity. It'll happen at the right time.
John Lovallo: Understood. Thank you, guys.
Stuart Miller: Thank you. And so, let's leave it there. I want to thank everybody for joining us. We really look forward to continued execution as we go forward. I'm very happy with our third quarter. Looking forward to reporting year-end and look into 2024. We'll talk next time. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect your line and please enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-06-15 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for the reading of the forward-looking statements.
David Collins: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Sorry about the delay. We had a lot of people joining. Wanted to make sure if people had an opportunity to get in. I'm in Dallas today together with Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President, and we're joined remotely from Miami by Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEO and Co-President, Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer, David Collins, our Controller and Vice President, and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. As I said, they are all in Miami, so there will be a bit of coordination here. As usual, I'm going to go ahead and give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Rick's going to walk through our markets around the country, comment on our land position. Then John's going to update supply chain, cycle time, and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight, along with some limited guidance for the third quarter to assist in forward thinking and some guidance for the year. And then we'll answer questions, as many as we can. As usual, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so we can get as many in as possible. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are quite pleased to report that the Lennar team has remained focused on production and pace, cash flow, inventory turns, and return on capital, and we have again produced strong and consistent results for the quarter. Our second quarter results are consistent with the stabilization we have seen in the current economic environment, as well as consistent adherence to our core operating strategies that we've discussed on prior quarterly conference calls. As it relates to home building, the economic environment has stabilized as customers have adjusted to and accepted higher-for-longer interest rates, the supply chain chaos has normalized, inventories have remained low, and the supply of housing across the country is in very limited supply. This environment seems to represent a new normal that has formed in the wake of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes starting last year. While persistent inflation remains in the system, aggressive rate hikes have given way to moderated and measured rate movements, allowing the market to adjust in orderly fashion. The strong demand for housing that had been curtailed by sticker shock and affordability challenges has returned, while the housing market adjusted prices, incentives, including rate buy-downs, and production costs in order to enable customers to afford needed shelter. And even while interest rates and affordability were primary headwinds to demand, the well-documented chronic housing supply shortage has kept inventory levels very low, which has continued to propel customers to stretch their finances for needed housing, as incentives and price reductions combined to spark sales activity. The net price of homes has moderated through price reductions together with the use of interest rate buy-downs and other incentives, and the net average sales price has stabilized and not gone higher nor lower for that matter, even as demand has returned. We have seen in our numbers that net average sales prices on home closings have dropped approximately 10% or 11% on home sales from the peak of approximately $500,000 in 2022 to approximately $450,000 now, and we expect that that pricing is going to remain constant throughout the year. I would note additionally that through our multifamily apartment division, we are also seeing that rental rates have moderated. Given our extensive experience in the multifamily apartment market, along with our for-sale and for-rent housing business, we see that there is general downward pressure on rents, as many markets have become somewhat overbuilt and there is additional inventory being completed and coming online. This inventory will complete over the next year and a half. While rents won't likely drop significantly, they are not likely to grow very much either. Remember that rentals and rent equivalents make up a significant part of the CPI calculation. Overall, we believe that the housing market has leveled and while net average sales prices are lower, cancellations have been normalizing and margins have bottomed and are recovering as cost reductions and value engineering provide an offset to the price reductions. Looking ahead, we continue to believe that the market and the economy will remain constructive for home builders as pent-up demand continues to come to market and consume affordable offerings. Additionally, we believe that the supply constraint will continue to limit available inventory and maintain supply-demand balance. The core elements of the supply shortage will not resolve in the near term as the almost 15-year production deficit will take years to resolve. And note that even when existing homes with low-interest mortgages -- even when existing homes with low-interest mortgages that are not currently trading, do come to the market and add to supply, the sellers will also need a place to move and that creates a net zero to overall dwellings, in addition to supply and in addition to demand and therefore still a housing shortage. Bottom line, supply is short, demand is returning to affordable offerings and builders will need to produce more homes to fill the void. Against this backdrop, the Lennar team has remained consistent in our commitment to strategies that we articulated as rates began to climb over a year ago. Let me do a quick review as these strategies explain both what we have accomplished as well as what we expect to accomplish throughout the remainder of the year. First, we said then, as we say now, that we maintain volume and production as our constant and margin as our shock absorber and we manage our business with certainty through volatility staying focused on production, inventory turn, cash flow and return on assets. Accordingly, we maintain volume keeping our production machine working efficiently while rationalizing costs. In the second quarter, our sales team engaged our digital marketing platform in conjunction with our dynamic pricing model to continue to drive sales volume at market pricing in order to maintain consistent production levels and improve our inventory turn. We affectionately call this configuration the Lennar machine and it is designed to produce consistent sales pace at pricing that enables consistency as the market adjusts. Although it is not perfect yet, the Lennar machine drove new order volume to 17,885 new orders exceeding last year's volume by 1% and this enabled our production group to operate with predictability and consistency. Additionally, we efficiently backfilled cancellations in the quarter, which have now dropped to some 13.5% enabling our deliveries to exceed expectation at 17,074 deliveries and that was up 3% over last year. If by chance, by the way, any of you happen to be in Miami, come on by and ask to see the Lennar machine in action. I think you'll get a better sense of our strategy and you just might start to imagine where the often talked about AI might find its way into the sometimes stodgy home building industry and improve productivity. And to this end, we have a new and exciting Chief Technology Officer at Lennar named Scott Spradley. Welcome aboard, Scott. Let's get to work. We've continued to focus on selling homes at market clearing prices, reducing margin when conditions weaken, and improving margin as conditions level and improve. Accordingly, our margins bottomed in the first quarter at 21.2%, then as the market levelled this past quarter, we saw margin improvement to 22.5%, and we're expecting further improvement next quarter to 23.5% to 24%, and further improvement beyond that, of course, depending on market conditions. Through all phases of the market cycle, we are consistently producing strong cash flows. The elements of execution are working extremely well and improving with the Lennar machine, and we've gained confidence in our ability to now guide to increased volume for the year of 68,000 deliveries to 70,000 deliveries with strong margins and strong cash flow. Our second strategy has been to work with our trade partners to right-size our cost structure to the current sales price environment, while we continue to drive our cycle time to pre-supply chain crisis levels. John will cover this strategy in more detail shortly, but John and Rick have been focused across our platform with our production and our purchasing teams, as well as our trade partners. Considerable results are reflected both on the margin improvement and in the number of homes that were construction-ready and available for delivery. On the margin front, since Lennar led the way with a reduction in margin while maintaining volume and increasing market share, as the market corrected, in the wake of an industry-wide reduction in starts, we engaged our trade partners to work side-by-side with us to help find efficiencies in production, to right-size their margins as well, and to work side-by-side in driving efficiencies on the site. As margin expanded in the best of times, they benefited. As margins have now contracted in the more difficult times, we all understand the benefits of predictability and consistency that derives from consistent volume and scale. Cycle time continues to be a work in progress. While we continue to make improvement, we improved from 219 days last quarter to 215 days this quarter, this is truly like fixing a plane that is in flight, as progress is slow and difficult to measure as products change. Nevertheless, we're making slow but steady progress as improvement will help reduce inventory turn, which now stands at 1.2 versus 1.1 last year. Our third strategy is to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions, as well as on land and land bank strategy. While Rick will give additional detail on land, this has been a specific concentrated focus by all three of us, myself, Rick, and John, across the platform, working connected and together to refine our approach to reducing land exposure and becoming increasingly asset light. We've made significant progress in reducing land held on our balance sheet, with now 70% of our land controlled and only 30% owned. As with our trade partners, our land partners or sellers have become strategic partners in maintaining volume and increasing market share, while helping to rationalize cost. Our fourth playbook strategy was to manage our operating costs, or our SG&A, so that even at lower gross margin, we will drive a strong net margin. While we've been driving our SG&A down over the past years, quarter by quarter, to new record lows, and many of those changes, although not all, are hardwired into permanent inefficiencies in operations, there are some components that have grown as we've had to address more difficult market conditions. Examples, of course, are realtor costs and marketing expenses, which have had to expand as customer acquisition has become more challenging. Nevertheless, we were able to achieve a respectable 6.7% SG&A this quarter, which resulted in a strong net margin of 15.8% after net. We know that in more difficult times, there is and should be upward pressure on sales and marketing costs in order to drive and find purchasers and drive new sales. We believe, however, if we continue to drive volume, we'll be able to constrain increases and manage to a very attractive cost level and net margin. Our fifth playbook strategy was to maintain tight inventory control and the Lennar machine of digital marketing, sales management, and dynamic pricing has materially improved inventory control by enabling a focus on selling homes in inventory, focusing on -- focusing maximum attention on underperforming communities, and bringing attention to product plans that are simply just not selling. Clearing the homes that are complete and closable rather than selling homes that are many quarters in the future is exactly what drives cash flow and we're focused on this part of our business every day. Both land and home inventory control is mission central for our overall business and in our second quarter numbers, you can see in our continuing quarterly improvement in our now 13.3% debt to total capital -- capitalization ratio down from 14.2 last quarter and our $4 billion cash position that our inventory and our balance sheet is being carefully managed to provide excellent liquidity and flexibility for our future. These elements of business continue to be managed through every other day management meetings where numbers are reviewed at the regional and divisional levels by the entire management team. Starts, sales and closings are maintained in a controlled balance with the end result of volume with defined expectations. The sixth playbook strategy was to continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. If we reflect on our second quarter results, we not only accomplished excellent cash flow and bottom line results, but we repurchased $208 million of stock and we also repurchased approximately a $158 million of senior debt due in fiscal 2024. We expect to continue to generate considerable earnings and cash flow and accordingly, will continue to retire debt and purchase stock opportunistically. Let me say in conclusion that our second quarter of 2023 has been an excellent quarter for Lennar. We saw market conditions level and stabilize at least for now and we executed on our core strategies. We are extremely well positioned to navigate the uncertainties of the current market. We engaged the difficulties of the past year with a consistent strategy that promoted certainty of execution throughout the company. When market conditions were difficult and uncertain, Lennar associates knew their mission. Similarly, as the market has leveled, Lennar associates know mission and exactly how to execute. Our strategy is well known and understood through our division offices and we have a plan that -- we have a plan as the inevitable cycles of our industry even and flow. We focus on maintaining volume while we price our homes to drive a consistent pace. We work with our trade base to manage cost and inefficiencies -- and efficiencies. We manage both our land and our production inventories to drive cash flow and returns on investment. We focus our asset light model in order to drive balance sheet efficiency and drive return on investment. Finally we fortify our balance sheet to have liquidity for strength and flexibility. Knowing what to do and executing per plan has driven this quarter's success and continues to guide us into the next quarter and beyond. We are confident that we will continue to perform and drive Lennar to new levels of performance. Thank you and now let me turn over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market has continued to normalize and recover as buyers have become more comfortable with higher mortgage rates. Tight inventory levels in the resale and new home market propels demand for available new homes and we offered a combination of attractive pricing and compelling mortgage rate programs to capture that demand. While many of our markets are performing well, in all of our markets we are regularly adjusting base prices and incentives to maintain our targeted sales pace. Our strategy has been to maintain our targeted start phase, continue to sell homes, and adjust our pricing to reflect market conditions. In that sales with starts, we have used dynamic pricing model and the Lennar machine Stuart just previewed to continuously find the market clearing price of each of our homes on a community by community basis as quickly as possible. We fundamentally believe that our price to market strategy reflects our balance sheet first focus where we can maximize starts and sales, increase market share, generate cash flow, and keep our home building machine going. With this end, John will discuss the operational and cost benefits of maintaining our start phase. Our second quarter results reflect the successful execution of our price to market strategy. During the quarter, our new sales orders increased 1% from the prior year and 26% from the first quarter with the first and second quarter seasonal change exceeding our historical average over the last three years. New orders increased sequentially in each month during the quarter. Our sales pace for community averaged 4.8% in the second quarter, down 4% from the prior year, but up 23% from the first quarter. Our second quarter new sales price decreased 11% from the prior year and was up a slight 1% from the first quarter. Our cancellation rate during the quarter totalled 13.5%, which was a significant improvement from our first quarter. All of these operating comparisons reflected stabilization and normalization across our markets and Lennar's continued focus on using price and incentives to achieve our targeted sales pace per community. These results compare very favorably to nationally reported results and highlight the increase in our market share across our footprint, driven by a carefully crafted starts and sales program. Our sales activity and cancellation rates in the first few weeks of June have been consistent with our second quarter results. And now I'd like to give you an update on our markets across the country. In prior quarters, I described three categories, one, markets that are performing well, two, markets that are performing but require slightly higher pricing adjustments and incentives to maintain our targeted sales, and three, markets that require more aggressive pricing adjustments, incentives, and repositioning to regain momentum. In the second quarter, we did not have any of the category in three markets. During the second quarter and so far in June, we've had 14 markets that are performing well. These include Southwest Florida, Southeast Florida, Tampa, Palm Atlantic, New Jersey, the Philly metro area, Charlie, Raleigh, Charlotte, Raleigh, and Coastal Carolinas, Indianapolis, Dallas and Houston, Phoenix, and San Diego. These markets are benefiting from low inventory and many are benefiting from a strong local economy, employment growth, or in migration. New sales in these markets reflect more normalized incentives, which may include closing costs, assistance, minor mortgage rate buy-downs in order to maintain sales momentum. In the second quarter, we had 26 category in two markets. While many of these markets have improved relative to the first quarter and are meeting our sales targets, they still require higher pricing adjustments and incentives than our category one markets. Our category two markets include Jacksonville, Ocala, Orlando, Gulf Coast, Northern Alabama, Atlanta, Virginia and Maryland, Chicago and Minneapolis, Nashville, Austin, San Antonio, Colorado, Tucson, Las Vegas, Cal Coastal, the Inland Empire, the Bay Area, Central Valley, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle, Utah, Reno, and Boise. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we've had to offer mortgage rate buy-downs, base price reductions, closing costs, and other incentives to maintain momentum. The size of the adjustment can vary on a community-by-community basis and it's often been limited to specific homes each week. We've been very proactive and work closely with Lennar Mortgage to create highly attractive, cost-efficient, and timely financing packages that have enabled us to offer attractive purchase prices for our customers. This hands-on coordination between our sales and mortgage teams has enabled us to sell our homes quickly and avoid building up finished inventory. Before I turn it over to John, I'd like to discuss our landline strategy and community count. Much of our balance sheet and inventory management progress is driven by the execution of our land strategy while simultaneously driving sales, delivery and managing production. Quarter after quarter, we have worked with our strategic land partners and land banks to develop relationships for them to purchase land on our behalf and deliver just-in-time finished home sites to our home building machine on a monthly and quarterly basis. In the second quarter, about 90% of our 1.2 billion land acquisition was finished home sites purchased from various land structures. We continue to make significant progress on our land life strategy. This was evidenced by our second quarter ending year's own supply of home sites improving to 1.7 years from 2.4 years prior year and our controlled home site percentage increasing to 70% from 60% for the same time period. I would like to conclude by discussing community count. Our community count at the end of the second quarter was 1,263 communities, which was up 3% from the prior year period and we expect to increase our community count in the highest single digits by the end of fiscal 2023 from the end of fiscal 2022. As I mentioned last quarter, the bulk of these communities will come online in the fourth quarter. I'd now like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thank you, Rick. As Stuart and Rick discussed, Lennar's operations have continued the steady execution of maintaining our starts and sales pace. Our strategy is to price homes to market so our construction machine can operate smoothly without the disruptions of stopping and restarting. This strategy enabled us to reduce our direct construction cost as expected, delivering gross margin improvement in the quarter. While we achieved some gross margin benefit in Q2 from cost reductions, a greater amount of cost reductions will impact margins equally in Q3 and Q4 based on the timing of when homes were started. As noted, our quarterly starts and sales pace were 5.3 homes and 4.8 homes per community respectively. Utilizing the Lennar machine, we focused on the orderly selling of homes at the right pace, so homes are sold prior to their completion. This process allowed us to not build up excess finished inventory as we ended the second quarter with approximately one inventory home per community, consistent with our Q1 ending inventory level. Our strategy of maintaining starts also plays a major role in gaining access to the labor we need and is the foundation for our previously stated objectives of lowering construction costs, reducing cycle time, and achieving even and flow production. While Lennar starts were down year-over-year for the first half of 2023, industry-wide start levels were down 100% more than Lennar's. We've heard from our trade partners how important it is to them that we have maintained starts in all of our communities and all markets. Our production-first strategy has had a dramatic effect on Lennar being the builder of choice for trades. At many of our trade partners, Lennar represents over 70% of their business. These trade partners saw little to no decrease in their work while at the same time the industry start levels were contracting by 30%. Looking forward, we will continue to increase our starts and expect Q3 and Q4 starts to both be above 2022 levels. Looking at our second quarter, as expected, our construction costs fell sequentially from Q1 by about 3%. While our Q2 costs were up about 8% on a year-over-year basis, this was down significantly from the 13% year-over-year increase we had in Q1. Again, this is the trajectory of cost reductions we guided to last quarter. In addition to our trade partners stepping up with cost reductions, we also took our value engineering focus to a new level. While we have always value engineered our plans, we created a dedicated team as part of our national supply chain group to focus on this area. This team works hand-in-hand with our divisions both in the field and the office to drive cost and constructability efficiencies. Going forward, this team will focus on our core plan strategy. Rick and I were in Houston last week attending our Internal Annual National Supply Chain Meeting led by Kemp Gillis. There, we saw firsthand how this team has shifted from fighting the battle of supply chain disruptions to achieving the needed cost reductions to offset our sales price reductions. Now, this team is looking ahead and is fully engaged in initiatives that will impact our results in 2024 and beyond. This includes programs to structurally offset future cost increase pressures and to implement new technologies to both make the field process more efficient than ever and transform the way we manage information for the bidding process. We can report that there is a great intensity in this team and more focus on innovation than ever before. With respect to the supply chain, the second quarter had the least supply chain disruption since 2020. This was due to the combination of a steep decline in industry-wide starts along with manufacturers operating in much higher capacities for an extended period, augmented by Lennar supply chain strategies and communication. The lack of supply chain disruptions helped our continued reduction in cycle time. We saw modest improvement in our second quarter and expect to see a more meaningful improvement in the back half of the year. For the quarter, cycle time decreased by four days sequentially from Q1. As we move into our third and fourth quarters, we will benefit from greater cycle time reductions that of a primary driver for our increased guidance and deliveries for 2023. Additionally, we will start about 3,500 homes in Q3 that will reduce cycle time, will allow us to have the appropriate inventory levels to achieve our delivery guidance. The reduction of cycle time in the back half of the year will also free up cash that is otherwise tied in our inventory, further strengthening our balance sheet. In the second quarter, we made meaningful progress in evolving from the production challenges of the supply chain disruptions for even flow production. While there is still meaningful progress to be made in obtaining even flow production from start to finish, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank all of our construction and purchasing associates for delivering one of the smoothest quarters of closings. All of us at Lennar are focused every single day on lowering costs, reducing cycle time, achieving even flow production, enabling improved margins as G&A efficiencies, a stronger balance sheet, and the delivery of high quality affordable homes. I would now like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our home delivery performance. So therefore, our usual, I am going to spend a few minutes on the results of financial services and reemphasize some of our balance sheet accomplishments. And then provides some high level thoughts for Q3. So starting with financial services, for the second quarter, our financial services teams had operating earnings of $112 million. Looking at the details of the mortgage and federal operations, mortgage operating earnings were $82 million compared to $74 million in the prior year. The increase in earnings was driven by a higher profit per loss to loan due to higher secondary margins, which was partially by lower loss volume. Title operating earnings were $33 million compared to $30 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and a decrease in cost per transaction as the team continues to focus on gaining efficiency through technology. These valid results were accomplished as the result of great synergies between our home building and financial services team, as they successfully executed together through the developing market. They truly operate under the banner of one-Lennar. So now turning to the balance sheet. There's a constant drum beat at Lennar to be laser focused on returns on invested capital and cash flow. This quarter, we were unwavering in our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by increasing production as we've priced homes to market to deliver as many homes as possible. The drum beat continued with our determination to preserve cash and increase asset efficiency with a judicious eye towards land spend. As we noted, we spent approximately $1.2 billion on land purchases this quarter of which approximately 90% of the initial sites where vertical construction will soon begin. The results of these strategies was that we ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and no borrowing on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $6.6 billion of home building liquidity. Given our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we enhanced our goal of becoming land lighter. As we noted, our years' homes improved to 1.7 years from 2.4 years in the prior year, and our home sites controlled increased to 70% from 68% in the prior year. At quarter end, we owned 117,000 home sites and controlled 207,000 homes sites for a total of 387,000 homes sites. We believe, this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in the capital efficient way. During the quarter, we started about 19,700 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 37,300 total homes in inventory of which about 1300 were completed unsold as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased two million shares, totalling $208 million, and we paid dividends totalling $110 million. In our continued effort to further strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our debt balances, as we noted, we repurchased $158 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in fiscal 2024 at prices below par. We've repaid about $5.6 billion of senior notes over the last several years, which equates to approximately $300 million of interest savings. Combined with strong earnings, our holding debt to total capital ratio was 13.3% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 17.7% in the prior year. And then just a few final points on our balance sheet. We remain committed to increasing returns. Our shareholders' equity increased to $25 billion. Our book value per share increased to $87. Our return on inventory was 28%, and our return on equity was 18%. So in summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity, and low leverage provides us with significant confidence and financial flexibility as we move through 2023. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to our thoughts for the third quarter and provide some ranges of each of the components of earnings, as well as a few data points for fiscal 2023. Starting with new orders, we expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 18,000 to 19,000 homes as we remain focused on achieving our production goals. We expect our Q3 ending community count to be flat with Q2 ending count, though, as Rick indicated, we expect to see high single-digit growth year over year by the end of our fiscal year on November 30. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 17,750 to 18,250, and we're raising our delivery expectations for the full year to 68,000 to 70,000 homes, which is an increase from the previous guidance of 62,000 to 66,000. Our Q3 average sales price should be consistent with Q2 as we continue to be focused on delivering affordable homes. We expect Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 24% as we see continued impact of our cost savings initiatives, with some offset for higher land costs as we continue to purchase a greater number of finished onsets. I'll note that, as is historically the case, we expect our Q4 gross margin to be sequentially higher than Q3, though it is difficult to provide more direction at this time. We expect our Q3 SG&A to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%, and for the combined home building, joint venture, land sales, and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $25 million. We anticipate our financial services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. We expect a loss of about $10 million from our multifamily business and a loss of approximately $20 million for the Lennar Other category. Remember that the Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments on our technology investments -- that adjustment will be determined by the stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% to 1.5% of total revenue and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.7%, and the weighted average share count should be approximately 284 million shares. When you pull all that together, these estimates should produce an EPS range of approximately $3.35 to $3.50 per share for the third quarter. And with that, let's turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Kenneth Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.
Kenneth Zener: As I understand the benefit of your even flow process, you're able to decapitalize your balance sheet, lifting inventory turns, which is consistent with our inventory turns equal alpha thesis. So my first question is, what do you consider to be the most efficient or targeted start pace long-term, giving starts equal orders, relative to 2Q's 5.3 pace that you set your margin shock absorber to, in your words?
Stuart Miller: Let me start by saying, Ken, that it's a combination of -- even flow is a combination of going asset light, but it's also a very focused program on our building partner relationships, enabling consistency and predictability relative to our trade partners to enable us and them to become the most efficient versions of ourselves. So your question is what is that start pace? And the start pace is a program that we think about putting in place as we evolve our understanding of performing and underperforming communities, their relationship to sales and closings. And a lot of this is data-driven and evolving. So there isn't a number that we can give you. It's more a concept that we are solving to and iterating to and using a lot of data feedback loops to come to numbers that make sense across a broad spectrum of 40 divisions, 40 geographies all working in sync. Jon?
Jon Jaffe: I would also add that it's very dependent upon community specifics and market specifics in terms of what's the right pace. So it might be a very different pace for Dallas than it is, say, for Seattle. And we very carefully measure that balance market by market so that we can match a sales pace and start pace according to market demand, land availability, labor availability.
Kenneth Zener: I appreciate that there. It sounds like there's several layers to peel.
Stuart Miller: Yes, there are. And by the way, let me just say, it's handled with an every other day meeting and not just data feedback loops, but interpersonal feedback loops that are constantly in motion. But go ahead.
Kenneth Zener: Right. No, no. It sounds like you have to be actually responsive to the trade in part. So second, considering your non-WIP inventory, owned lots fell about 20% year-over-year to 1.7 years, very impressive. And Diane, I'm very glad that you report and adjust out inventory units. So my question is, to what level can owned lots go to in your even flow framework, given Rick's 90% finished lot purchase comment, if I heard that correct. And are you willing to kind of offer a goalpost for FY '24, perhaps implied cash flows, given you've been dropping almost 0.2 years' owned. Sequentially, it's very impressive.
Stuart Miller: Sure. Thank you. And Rick, why don't you go ahead and take that question?
Rick Beckwitt: We have a target out for 2024, yes. All I know is, as Stuart mentioned in his comments, Jon, myself and Stuart are laser focused on our asset-light balance sheet and continuing to improve the percentage of homesites we control versus own. We've developed some incredible relationships with our land partners and with our land banks that really have facilitated us to improve on these metrics.
Diane Bessette: And I guess I might add, while we're not there yet, our goal -- as we continue to be asset lighter and have less years owned, our goal would be to have our net income equaling our cash flow. And we're not there yet, but we're working towards just replacing what we're delivering. So that's the longer-term goal.
Stuart Miller: And let me just say that, look, we've set out a goal in terms of becoming an asset-light model. We report outwardly to all of you our progress along the way. But inwardly and in the background, we are working on not just relationships but structural programs to enhance the ability, to manage an asset-light model and to continue to improve it. Where we will actually end up, we're not going to lay out timeframes and numbers, but you can expect that there is going to be continuous improvement in the space.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.
Susan Maklari: My first question is, it sounds like the supply chain is slowly improving, and you are seeing healing happening there. But it does feel like it's, in general, still fairly fragile. Are there lessons that you learned in the last couple of years that you can apply as the start pace does pick up from here, so that you can make sure that you're not running into some of those same challenges that you faced and therefore, maintaining those inventory turns, maintaining that cash generation that you're looking to do.
Stuart Miller: Jon, why don't you take that?
Jon Jaffe: Susan, first, let me say that from Lennar's perspective, it really feels like the supply chain disruptions are behind us with a few minor exceptions. And perhaps that's, as I noted in my remarks, due to our size and scale, working with manufacturers that are running at an extended period of time of full capacity. But there are definitely lessons learned as. We had to scramble through the supply chain disruptions, we learned how to work differently with our manufacturers, providing them different types of forecast, more visibility into what's coming as well as how we can create local distribution for them that really cuts down the lead times. And so there's no question, there's lessons learned. And that really is reflective of my comment of the intense focus on the look forward that we hope is going to drive improved results in '24 and beyond.
Stuart Miller: I feel that your question really is, have we altered some of the landscapes in the way that we stockpile parts and programs? I think that there are definitely things that we have seen and learned as we've gone through the challenges of the supply chain. I think that Rick and Jon together have been working with our trade partners to think about how we prevent those same kind of log jams or bottlenecks from taking place again. And that's an evolving picture. Can we point to specifics right now? Probably not as much as you'd like us to, but it is something that we're focused on.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's very helpful color. And then I guess staying on the topic of cash generation, when you think about Diane's comments to Ken's question around free cash flow conversion, it implies that you're going to have really some very impressive levels of cash. How do you think about the allocation of that capital? You bought back some stock this quarter. You paid down debt. But long term, how are you thinking about the shareholder return piece of that? And where that sort of fits relative to where we are today?
Stuart Miller: Yes. Great question. We're very focused on that. As you can imagine, we do see increased cash flow accumulating. And Diane won't let me tell you to what extent, but it's greater than where we are right now, and that sets up opportunity. It is -- capital allocation has become a very strategic part of our thinking process. We consider regularly the relationship between debt retirement and stock buyback. For now, we are taking an opportunistic view of stock buyback in that we are -- we have basically been focused on a steady-state level of repurchase, but that could grow over time as we look opportunistically. And we are also looking at other strategic possibilities that will reveal over time. We're not asleep at the switch. We recognize that the accumulation of cash is a bit unusual within the industry. We're not uncomfortable with it, and we're being very thoughtful about it. That will evolve over time.
Susan Maklari: Okay. Thank you for all the color and good luck.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: My first question is going to also focus a little bit on the balance sheet side. And I guess, specifically, in the wake of the regional bank trust, we're hearing that there's this window of opportunity that's opening up to maybe acquire some attractively positioned lots or even operations from some of the smaller, less well-capitalized builders, allowing builders such as yourself with a big war chest to accelerate market share gains. And I'm curious, could you weigh in on that? Are you seeing that as well? And if you are, can you take advantage of these kinds of opportunities, these emerging opportunities while maintaining your asset-light program by utilizing your existing off-balance sheet structures? Or is it reasonable to think your own lot count might move up a little bit before moving down again later? Or that you would need to create some other structures in order to accommodate it? If you can just give us some sense of how you're thinking about that relative to this window of opportunity that we're hearing about.
Stuart Miller: So Steve, these are focal points that are well right in the middle of our radar screen. I think that we're a bit early stage in some of the questions and considerations. I think that some of these questions are more applicable immediately in the land development side of the business, where land developers who are not part of Lennar are definitely feeling some stress. I think that the capital accumulation that we have in cash on our books is a strategic opportunity for us to participate and make sure -- and making sure that there is even flow by some of the participants, either through partnership or other structures. In terms of some of the homebuilders, I think that there is still capital available for those that are operating in the production world. Whether that changes over time, we certainly have a front seat at the table in terms of being able to act where the right opportunities fit. We've done it before. We're not afraid to go forward. Your question about off-balance sheet structures is a really important one, because many know that we've spent an awful lot of time and are spending a lot of time on creating systemic solutions for what I think of as kind of an opco-propco type configuration. There is no question that the structures that we have worked on can be constructive relative to some of the dysfunction that is in the market right now, and we're working in those directions as well. So I guess the best answer to your question is a broad one, and that is all of the above, it's all on the table. We are uniquely positioned to be able to participate. And all of it will be focused on building production trajectory, production consistency in growing the core business, the manufacturing homebuilding business. As we go forward, we have the latitude of balance sheet to be able to do that in a lot of different ways.
Stephen Kim: That's great. Yes, it's going to be interesting to watch. With respect to your income statement, your -- you gave a 3Q order guide, which we appreciate. And it suggests an absorption rate, sales per community per month above what you achieved in the heyday of 2021 or post-pandemic period, it appears. And I'm curious, are absorption rates benefiting from a sort of mix shift of community types, such as maybe more communities with attached product or larger communities or something like that? And if so, if there is this kind of mix shift that's happening behind the scenes, can you give us a sense for how much further this mix shift can go in a positive direction?
Stuart Miller: Rick, why don't you take that? And then, Jon.
Rick Beckwitt: So I would tell you that the pace that we're looking at going forward, particularly with regards to Q3, is really a reflection of the strategy that we all have implemented with regard to starts. And as we said, we are going to run a production machine. Jon, Stuart and I have really laid out work with our regional teams and division team to develop that community-by-community start base. We are benefiting a bit by some lower entry-level communities in a few markets. But over and above, what it really gets down to is a very disciplined, carefully managed stretch program. And that's why we're comfortable in giving you the visibility that we've given.
Jon Jaffe: Steve, I would add, as Rick is saying, it is really paying attention closely to matching sales to our start pace so we don't build up inventory. And it's not so much going to attach product. It's going to markets that allow us to have a higher sales pace because we're at a lower price point. Many of the Texas markets are a great example of that. We're really able to go down the price curve, but we're doing that in all of our markets, and that allows us to incrementally quarter-by-quarter to increase our sales pace.
Stephen Kim: And starts base, got you. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next call comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Truman Patterson: Wanted to follow up on Steve's question on the third quarter orders guide. That suggests orders, they typically increase sequentially when they normally decline. A few ways of looking at this, clearly, your starts pace, but underlying demand, is remaining healthy and atypically strengthening sequentially or that solid start space that you talked about, available spec inventory is taking market share from traditional build-to-order builders and/or private builder capabilities are more limited today from bank tightening. I'm just hoping -- I'm hoping you all can help us think through this a little bit further.
Stuart Miller: I'm going to let Jon answer that, but before I do, I want to correct you, Truman. I'm in Dallas. So it is still morning here. So go ahead, Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Truman, so if you look at our strategy, we really accelerated our starts in Q2, recognizing the market opportunity where the industry was pulling back. And given that we didn't have an inventory buildup because of our strategy, we felt there was an opportunity to be more aggressive with starts and take advantage of the lack of resale inventory as well as the lack of new sale inventory. So we feel comfortable that we'll be able to sell at an accelerated pace because we'll have the inventory when the marketplace in general is in providing that inventory with a backdrop of really healthy demand for housing. So that gives us confidence that we'll be able to continue to accelerate our sales pace, managing that start pace.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then it seems like you all are getting the cost savings that you spoke about previously. But I wanted to follow up on the comment, further improvement in gross margin beyond the third quarter, depending on market conditions. But if we assume that conditions are just stable from here, would fourth quarter gross margins continue to increase just outside of normal field expense leverage on deliveries? Said another way, should you see incremental cost savings sequentially into the fourth quarter, while maybe some modest pricing benefit on an apples-to-apples basis flows through?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So we decidedly didn't give any broader thoughts on margin for our fourth quarter, recognizing that, number one, we're feeling some leveling. So we're giving you some guidance for our third quarter and some thoughts on production for year-end. I think that the market still has enough proving to do, and it's moving around enough to where we really don't want to go beyond what we've said, and that is depending on market conditions, and we're going to let them evolve. Certainly, yesterday, with the Fed chair pausing, but maybe it's not even a pause, it's -- I think there's a lot of wait and see in terms of where interest rates go and where the market goes and talks of recession and jobs. We're going to wait and see a little bit on that. But as we sit right now, what we've said is that we see our margins continuing to improve as we go through the year. We're not going to give a boundary as to what that actually means. Let's give it some time.
Truman Patterson: If I could just follow up quickly.
Stuart Miller: Sure. Sure.
Truman Patterson: The cost savings, should they just build into the fourth quarter, the cost savings that you've spoken about previously?
Stuart Miller: I think, again, this is something that we're going to wait and see a little bit, see how demand patterns continue forward. But our constructive relationship with our trade partners really enables us to maximize. What we have found in this past year is that commitment to the consistency and the predictability of volume is really working to everybody's benefit. And I would say that -- again, not to get too far over our skis, as we look ahead, we continue to see consistency in the trajectory, but we will have to wait and see how they actually flow through.
Truman Patterson: Perfect. I think we're seeing it in the results, and good luck in the coming quarters.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Nice quarter. I do have a question on some of the more near-term demand drivers. But Stuart, you did kind of bring up AI in your prepared remarks. And I know you guys have always been at the forefront of innovation in housing. And frankly, you don't hear AI mentioned a lot when it comes to housing. So I'm just curious if you're able to share any specifics in terms of where you see AI impacting your business going forward? And any steps the company has taken to be at the forefront of that?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So Alan, I wanted to be very careful with the use of that catch phrase that seems to be incendiary relative to stock prices when people are using them. I don't want to get out over our skis, but I did want a daylight that. The machine that we described that we are engaging is really a data-driven approach to so many components of our business. And I think that we have -- we've done a tremendous amount of work. If you look at our digital marketing program, you look at our dynamic pricing model, both of them, we've talked about for many, many quarters for years. And these are data-driven approaches to the way that we're engaging the customer acquisition componentry of our business. It's a very integrated set of systems that is dependent on feedback loops. And any time that you find a process that becomes data-driven and the data improves to the point that it's actually relevant, at some point, there are large learning models that can be helpful in enhancing productivity. These are the areas where we are leaning in. I mentioned that we brought on a strategic Chief Technology Officer in Scott Spradley. And all of this is a coordinated program of taking steps at a time to improve the ingestion of data, to use the data more constructively and then to bring it to its next level where we're actually driving productivity gains within our business. We'll have more to report. In the meantime, if you find yourself in Miami, come on by. We'll show you what we mean. We have visualized it, and you can understand what we're doing.
Alan Ratner: Great. Looking forward to checking that out, and I appreciate the additional information there. Second, on the pricing side, would love to just drill an air a little bit. So volume has continued to come in ahead of initial expectations. Your closing guide for the year now is about 10% above where it was 6 months ago. You're expecting orders to be up sequentially, which understood is a function of your start pace but you're probably not starting homes, unless you think there's demand for them. Yet when I hear your pricing commentary, it seems a bit more muted than I would expect, frankly, as far as more stability as opposed to maybe some pricing power returning to the market. So I know you've always been very articulate about your belief in the housing shortage at affordable prices, which I think is the key distinction there. And I'm curious if your decision at this juncture to not be more aggressive raising price is a function of your views on perhaps if prices were to go up or reaccelerate that, that would kind of take demand out of the market? Or is it just more of a conservatism stance around wanting to take market share in this still kind of choppy environment right now?
Stuart Miller: Listen, that's a great question. I think we'll all speak to that. Let me start by saying, we've been very thoughtful about this, and we're thoughtful about it on a day-to-day basis. We view the fact that at the affordable level, as you properly point out, there is a housing shortage. You hear it when you speak to mayors and governors across the country. You don't hear it as a national expression as much. But at the local levels, the need for workforce housing is a dominant need, and it's become a social imperative. So thinking about where we fit into the equation, and I don't want to make too much of this, but we have focused on saying, look, there's a void that needs to be filled. There's a needed an appetite. And what we're going to do is instead of driving price, we are going to drive pace and hold price. And that relationship between price and pace is something that Jon, Rick, myself, Diane, we talk about it all the time. It's the focus -- it's the whole focal point of the machine that we talk about. And at the core, we're recognizing that from the national landscape and the local landscapes, they need the volume, the supply is constrained, and therefore, we're focusing more on pace than we are on price. And we're focusing on consistency and predictability of pace so that we can rationalize costs at the same time. Rick? Jon? Whoever.
Rick Beckwitt: Stuart, I think you answered it well. It's really that consistency and cadence between starts and the sales that really keeps our machine going, and it makes us incredibly efficient. We're very focused on keeping our products affordable. In many cases, that's working hand in hand with our mortgage company and our mortgage in determining what that mortgage payment needs to be in order for us to transact. So it's a very careful and methodical approach. And if prices move, they move, but we're going to start and deliver the number of homes that we've targeted on a community-by-community basis.
Jon Jaffe: I would only add that if you think about our core strategy of being a production-first builder, we have consciously chosen not to limit production and drive pricing to maximize margins. We think we are a better company by being production first and managing sales pace to start pace that drives better returns, better cash flow that drives better returns. And that consistency that we all have spoken about really makes us a much more solid company. So it's a strategic decision that really is reflective in the way that you see our pricing.
Stuart Miller: Why don't we go ahead and take 1 more question?
Operator: Absolutely. Our final question comes from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Rehaut: Appreciate you getting me in before the end here. I wanted to just circle back, if I could, on the idea around 3Q orders. I think it's an important distinction in terms of your approach and maybe how that differentiates versus the market. And really, what I'm trying to get at is, you're talking about obviously the orders being driven by your own starts pace and strategy. I'm curious if in effect -- because we've also heard in the last month, maybe 1.5 months of an expectation by a lot of builders to return to normal seasonality. And certainly, historically, your own sales pace has been down about 10% sequentially 3Q versus 2Q. So do you feel that at this point in the game -- and you kind of highlighted the first few weeks of June, do you feel that this approach that you're taking is in fact market -- resulting in market share gains? In other words, that what you've seen over the last few weeks, maybe a month, we've heard a little bit of sequential softening month-to-month, which is typical. So I'm just trying to get a sense of when you talk about your 3Q outlook and your approach to starts, if this is, in fact, kind of an active kind of gain of share relative to what you're seeing across the broader marketplace?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So I think Jon laid this out a few minutes ago. And what we saw was that the appetite of the market favored ready-to-go inventory, shorter cycle closings, and that many were actually pulling back in that regard. And there are really multiple ways to think about this. Number one, the existing home market, which is generally a supplier of short-cycle ready-to-go inventory is somewhat constrained in that regard. Number two, a number of the builders in the context of the sharp increase in interest rates pulled back. The banking questions have perhaps limited part of the productive machine of the new home market to actually build inventory. We felt that there was an opportunity for us to fill a void. So I guess the answer to your question, Mike, is I think that we do see an opportunity to pick up some of the market share, where the market is not positioned to have that ready to go production or inventory in place available to the market. And we'll have to wait and see in the third quarter if we're right or not. But I think we feel pretty confident that we know where the market is, we know where the strength is, and that's what we've solved for.
Jon Jaffe: I would only add one point, Stuart. I think you covered it well. And that is remember, Mike, we have a lever that the resale market doesn't have. So it starts with the fact that there's record-low inventory in resale, as you know. But we can buy down mortgage rates where the resale market can't. So if we need to accelerate our sales pace when the market is giving us, we have that lever that we can pull, that's at our disposal.
Mike Rehaut: Right. No, no, that all makes sense. I appreciate that. I guess, secondly, and I apologize if I missed this from earlier, but I was just trying to -- I would love to get a sense of current incentives and discounts as a percent of sales. You kind of highlighted over again or a few times during this call, the mortgage rate buy downs. But just holistically, when you look at either buy-downs or other types of incentives or discounts, where are you today versus a quarter ago? And if -- how you're kind of expecting perhaps that trend, especially if ASPs are kind of steady. And you've kind of alluded to in your opening remarks perhaps some consumers having stretched finances, and perhaps the rate buydowns are part of a solve there. But just trying to get a sense maybe how incentives and discounts on a total basis have trended so far this year and how you're thinking about it going forward?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So Diane, why don't you go ahead and give some color on that? And we'll fill in.
Diane Bessette: Yes, Mike. So if you look at incentives and what we delivered in the first quarter, it was 10.2%, and that went down to 8.4%. So I think you're seeing a nice sequential decline. And all of that is just tied to being able to make homes affordable for people, so it all tied into the narrative that Stuart and Jon and Rick just went through. As I think about -- as we think about the rest of the year, that -- again, that's kind of our lever, right? It's adjusting prices and it's using incentives to make those homes affordable. So we'll see how that goes. We haven't given guidance, but we definitely saw a downward trend from Q1 to Q2.
Stuart Miller: All right. Why don't we go ahead and leave it there. Mike, thank you for your questions. And I want to thank everybody for joining us. We're pretty enthusiastic about how our business is navigating sometimes turbulent waters. And we look forward to reporting in our third quarter how things have continued and progressed. Thank you for joining.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect your line, and please enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-03-15 12:00:00) =====

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm here in Miami and joined by Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEO and Co-President; Jon Jaffe, Co-CEO and Co-President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. There are other executives here with us as well. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic overview of the company. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to walk through our markets around the country and comment on our land strategy, and then Jon is going to update construction cost, supply chain and cycle time. As usual, Diane will give additional financial highlights and we'll give some rough boundaries, not guidance, just foundries given volatility in the market for the second quarter to assist in forward thinking and modeling. And then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can include as many as possible. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're pleased to report that the Lennar team has produced strong and consistent results for the first quarter of what is shaping up to be a complicated and volatile 2023. The quarter started in December with traffic and sales stalled moving only with incentives and price adjustments. We entered January with interest rates declining and energized customer and improving margins, and then closed out February with rates again rising and challenging consumer confidence, although sales remained relatively strong due as adjusted prices, traffic was slowing. Of course, the quarter ended and the past couple of weeks have added new issues and questions that are reflective of a market that is looking for a bottom and looking for stability. With the Federal Reserve and Federal Government trying to reconcile the unintended consequences from aggressive interest rate hikes in order to curb the inflation, there is simply no way to see around corners and anticipate with certainty what comes next. This is exactly the kind of volatility that our core operating strategy of maintaining volume using incentives and sales price has been built to endure. With volume and production as are constant and margin as our shock absorber, we manage with certainty through volatility and stay focused on our mission. If market conditions deteriorate, we compromise margin through price and/or incentives, but we generate strong cash flow. If conditions improve, we improved margins and bottom line while also generating strong cash flow. Our primary focus is on cash flow. We maintain our volume to move through the limited legacy land that we have, which is at legacy prices while keeping our production machine working efficiently and rationalizing costs. And the fact that we are projecting a flattish number of deliveries in 2023 versus 2022 displays the strength of our strategy. Interest rates have continued to be the primary headwind to sales activity as inflation concerns have dominated the Federal Reserve's actions to date. At the same time, the housing supply shortage, especially workforce housing, discussed by every mayor and every governor across the country continues to drive customers to stretch their wallet as incentives and price reductions have worked to meet purchasers half way. Additionally, interest rates have also sidelined the professional or institutional purchasers. Higher capital costs, together with higher capitalization rates have made the purchase of single-family for rent homes less financially attractive as well. With that said, we still believe that the housing market is beginning to find a point of stabilization and customers, both primary and institutional are coming to grips with the new normal of higher but acceptable interest rates. The sudden sticker shock of rapidly rising interest rates in 2022 has mellowed. And while net prices are lower, incentives are moderating, cancellations have been normalizing lower and margins have been bottoming as cost reductions are beginning to provide an offset. As I have said many times in the past, the overall housing shortage remains a dominant theme and is defined by a decade-long production deficit in the country after the great recession. This deficit will be exacerbated by a growing reduction in housing starts of both single-family and multifamily homes brought on by the current housing recession. This shortage should be a stabilizing factor for the housing market over time. Against this backdrop, we've remained steadfast in our adherence to the strategies we adopted as the Fed began its tightening program approximately one year ago. As noted, we've continued to focus on selling homes at market clearing prices while building a consistent pace to meet the needs of a supply-constrained housing market. Whether for purchase or for rent, housing shortages are a major concern across the country, as I said, particularly at state and local levels. In spite of higher interest rates driving affordability concerns, more dwellings are needed and our mission is to meet that need. In the first quarter, we saw our margins fall to 21.2%, reflecting sales from prior quarters and adjustments to backlog. While margins fell 360 basis points over the prior quarter and 570 basis points year-over-year, they reflected the use of price reductions and incentives that is closing cost payments and interest rate buy-downs, to offset volatile interest rate and market shifts. We used these tools both to sell homes as well as to protect our backlog by adjusting pricing and incentives to ensure closings. Our first quarter cancellation rate improved to 21.5%. While this is higher than the 10.2% last year, it is decidedly lower than the 26% last quarter and has been falling in each consecutive month. While our new orders were down some 10% year-over-year, that result has compared favorably to reported market conditions and enabled us to maintain a strong start pace that enables us to increase our expected closings for the year to a range of 62,000 to 66,000 homes delivered. On a positive note, very limited new home inventory exists, limited existing home supply exists as existing homeowners hold on to extremely low mortgage rates and very limited multifamily production combined with the chronic housing production shortfall over the past decade and leads the industry in the middle of what we believe will be a fairly short duration correction without an inventory overhang to resolve. These factors will also extend the runway for longer-term housing growth as the correction develops. We derive growing confidence in our ability to achieve sales at the best possible prices from our significant investment in digital marketing, which is more relevant than ever before. We have used our dynamic pricing model in conjunction with our formidable and improving digital marketing platform to continue to drive sales volume at marquee clearing prices in order to maintain consistent production levels. Our proprietary DIGITS platform, which we built on a Microsoft backbone, provides digital marketing insights and analytics that guide us to better execution while maximizing pricing using our dynamic pricing model. Our digital marketing team and our dynamic pricing team are getting better and better each quarter and they enable us to refine and improve our execution and effectiveness as we accumulate more data and more experience. Our second strategy was to work with our trade partners to right-size our construction -- our cost structure to current market conditions while we re-establish cycle time at pre supply chain crisis levels. Jon will cover this in great detail shortly, but at a high level we continue to make meaningful progress with our trade partners as they appreciate our long-term strategy of maintaining consistent production. Relative to construction costs, Lennar led the way with reducing -- with a reduction in margin while maintaining volume and increasing market share as the market has corrected. As our margins have now contracted, we are driving cost reduction participation from our trade partners. Our trade partners are working side-by-side with us to reduce costs and to keep the production machine working. While there continues to be a lag in those reductions coming through our reported numbers, in the back half of the year, cost reductions will improve lagging margins. Cycle time reductions will also come through in the back half of the year. While cycle time has increased slightly this quarter from 211 days to 219 days last quarter, this timing reflects homes that have been in production for almost eight months. While we've reviewed the front end of construction for homes that have started more recently, we are seeing a two-week reduction already coming through, and we know that will improve over the next quarters. Improved cycle time will improve our inventory turn, which now stands at 1.2 and will help reduce inventory as we'll be able to carry less inventory to hit our deliveries; and accordingly, we will improve our return on inventory as well. Our third articulated strategy was to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions. While Rick will give detail on our land strategy, this has been a specific concentrated area of focus for all three of us, myself, Rick and Jon, across the platform. We recognized early that land would be expensive relative to reduced prices, and we therefore stopped the bleeding early. While we reconsidered every land deal in our pipeline, we have walked from deposits or renegotiated terms and price, and we have been relentless in focusing on protecting cash and only purchasing the next strong margin at today's market pricing. We purchased very little land this quarter as we await better pricing that is more in line with current home sale prices. New land purchases in time will improve lagging margins. Fortunately, we are well positioned with well-structured contracts and shorter-term deal structures that enable our capital allocation to be managed constructively. As with our trade partners, our land partners or sellers understand that we are maintaining volume and increasing market share while taking the first hit to our own margin. They will need to work together with us in cost reduction given lower home sales prices, where we'll just have to move on. Our fourth playbook strategy was to manage our operating costs, our SG&A so that even at lower gross margins, we will drive a strong net margin. We've been driving our SG&A down over the past years quarter-by-quarter to new record lows and many of those changes, though not all, are hardwired In our first quarter, we were able to marginally improve SG&A to 7.4% from 7.5% last year. And we believe if we continue to drive volume, we'll be able to limit increases and manage to advantageous cost levels. Nevertheless, as average sales prices come down, the percentages won't hold without corresponding additional cuts. We also know that in more difficult times, there will be upward pressure on some of our sales and marketing and realtor costs in order to drive and find purchasers and drive new sales. In this regard, the earlier discussion of our intense focus on our digital marketing platform is critically important in offsetting many of these potential cost increases. Our fifth playbook strategy is to maintain tight inventory control. This is exactly what drives cash flow and our cash flow machine, and we're focusing on this part of our business every day. Both land and home inventory control are a core focus of our overall business and leadership team. And in our first quarter -- and in our first quarter numbers, you can see our focus on these elements in our 14.2% debt-to-total capitalization rate, which is down 410 basis points from last year's 18.3%, and our $4.1 billion cash position, together with our 2% -- $2.6 billion undrawn revolver, which together provides excellent liquidity and flexibility. Tight control of land and completed home inventory has enabled cash flow so that our net debt to total capital is actually negative at this point. Inventory management is most carefully reviewed and as the most carefully reviewed and managed part of our business and enables us to maintain an extremely low inventory of completed, not sold homes, which are consistently -- which have been consistently been at or under one home per community for the past years. And right now, we have approximately 1,300 unsold and completed homes. We are well aware that inventory has remained flat as opposed to lower year-over-year as one might expect, because of expanded cycle time due to the supply chain disruption. We also know that this inefficiency will correct over the next few quarters and will return approximately $1.5 billion of inventory and turn it into additional cash. Additionally, a pause in growth this year will reduce inventory and generate additional cash over the next year as well. The sixth strategy is to continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. With our balance sheet strong, we are able to complement our strong operational execution with stock repurchases and debt reductions that improve total shareholder returns and return on equity. As we continue to execute our strategies, we will continue to drive strong cash flow and bottom line profitability. And even though bottom line profitability will be compressed year-over-year as prices and margins are impacted in a correcting market. Our balance sheet and our cash position will continue to improve. This improvement enables the flexibility to be opportunistic as market conditions stabilize. Finally, we have added an additional strategy, an additional core strategy since last quarter end. This is a strategy of continuous improvement focus throughout the company. Although it seems obvious and perhaps a little trite, we have created a central focus on continuous improvement metrics for every leader in our company with a direct tie to performance measurement and bonus structure. Last year, we recruited a new CHRO with specific expertise in this area, and we've developed a determined and constructive program of engagement and measurement across our platform. Welcome aboard, Drew Holler. Now that he has been with us for about six months, I wanted to formally welcome Drew to the company on our earnings call and let him know formally that we, meaning me, Rick, Jon and all of our shareholders expect really exciting improvements that will help Lennar continue to reach higher and drive harder to be the best version of ourselves. So in conclusion, it seems that the homebuilding industry has been skating on a very thin edge between some very strong headwinds and some equally strong tailwinds on that have required careful navigation and refined adjustment along the way. The headwinds have been defined by Federal reserve-driven interest rate increases driven by stubbornly high inflation. The consumer has attempted to adjust. The tailwinds have been defined by housing shortages across the country as well as production deficits over the past decade. And while the consumer remains challenged by affordability concerns, they are adjusting to the new normal of higher interest rates and opting to purchase their home. In these extraordinarily difficult and volatile market conditions, the Lennar team has focused on strategy, and we have executed with precision. We ended the first quarter with stronger-than-expected revenues and closings, strong profitability and cash flow, a fortified balance sheet and strong liquidity. We have a plan of execution to continue to navigate the uncertainties of 2023 with a focus on maintaining volume, maximizing margin, managing inventories, driving cash flow, managing land and -- land spend and further enhancing our balance sheet in spite of the challenging market conditions. Accordingly, we are not guiding but giving some broad boundaries for our second quarter closing to between 15,000 and 16,000 homes with a gross margin we expect between 21% and 21.5%. Additionally, we are targeting delivery volume for the full year to be between 62,000 and 66,000 homes as we drive volume and pick up market share and build margins back up through reconciliation of construction and land costs while carefully managing SG&A. While we're prepared for volatility and adversity along the way, we will stick to our focus on our core operating strategies in order to perform as expected. Simply put, that's what we expect of ourselves and we hope in the process, we will continue to earn your trust and respect. Thank you. And with that, let me turn over to Rick who's going to walk through a review of our market conditions across the platform.
Rick Beckwitt : Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the overall housing market has continued to be impacted by higher mortgage rates, which has impacted affordability and homebuyer confidence. While some of our markets are performing well, in most of our markets, we've had to adjust base prices, increase incentives and/or provide mortgage by rate buy-downs, maintain or regain our targeted sales pace. Our strategy has been to maintain our targeted sales pace, continue to sell homes and adjust our pricing to reflect market conditions. With this strategy, we have sacrificed gross margins to generate sales. Mass sales of starts, we've used our dynamic pricing model to continuously find the market clearing price for each of our homes on a community by community basis as quickly as possible. We fundamentally believe that our price to market strategy, reflects our balance sheet first focus where we can maintain starts and sales, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going. To this end, Jon will discuss the operational and cost benefits of maintaining our start pace. Our first quarter reflects first quarter results reflect the successful execution of our price to market strategy. During the first quarter, our new sales orders declined 10% from the prior year. These results, as Stuart mentioned, compare very favorably to competitor and nationally reported results. We did see improvement during the first quarter as new sales orders increased sequentially from the fourth quarter and in each month of the first quarter with our February 2023 sales pace per community totaling 4.7 sales, just 0.1 sales lower than our sales pace in February 2022. Our cancellation rate also declined from 26% in the fourth quarter to 21% in the first quarter with sequential improvement in each month of the quarter. In fact, our cancellation rate in February was 14%, much below our normalized cancellation rate. Our cancellation rates have benefited from the flawless execution of our Financial Services group in both finding the right mortgage product and locking mortgages with our home buyers. Our new order sales price in the first quarter totaled 452,000, up 8% from the fourth quarter with mix primarily pushing our average sales price higher. Sequentially, we saw a slight improvement and a reduction in our incentives, which was partially offset by lower base prices. We've been able to achieve small sequential monthly reductions in incentives during our first quarter without impacting sales pace. This trend has continued into the first two weeks of March. Notwithstanding the spike in interest rates in late February and continuing into the first two weeks of March, our sales and cancellation rates have maintained and we feel we have established market pricing and sales pace stability across our footprint. Now I'd like to give you an update on our markets across the country. In prior quarters, I had 3 categories: one, markets that are performing well; two, markets where we've adjusted pricing and incentives found the market price and have successfully regained sales momentum, and three, markets that require additional pricing adjustments incentives and focus to regain our targeted absorption phase. While our strategy has resulted in lower gross margins across the platform, the good news is that for now, we have no Category 3 markets. During the first quarter and so far in March, we had 10 markets that are performing well. These are Southeast Florida, Southwest Florida, Tampa, Palm Atlantic, New Jersey, Philly Metro, Charlotte, Coastal Carolinas, Indi and San Diego. These markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory and many are benefiting from strong local economy, employment growth and migration. While these markets have continued to perform well, we have had to selectively offer mortgage buy-down programs and normalized sales incentives. Some communities in these markets have required targeted price adjustments, but those are in a rare case. Our Category 2 markets, which reflect markets where we've made more significant adjustments and have successfully regained sales momentum include 29 markets. These include Jacksonville Ocala, Orlando, Gulf Coast, Northern Alabama, Atlanta, Raleigh, Virginia and Maryland, Chicago, Minnesota and Nashville, all the markets in Texas, including Austin, Colorado, Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas and the rest of California, Pacific Northwest, including Portland and Seattle, Utah, Reno and Boise. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we have had to offer more aggressive financing programs, base price reductions and/or increased incentives to regain sales momentum. Size of the adjustments is varied on a community-to-community basis and has often been limited to specific homes each week. In some cases, to avoid cancellations, we've adjusted pricing on our homes and backlog. We've been very proactive with our pricing and not reactive. This has allowed us to sell homes and avoid building up finished inventory. In all of our Category 2 markets, we have seen base prices stabilize. In a handful of our Category 2 markets, we've been able to increase our net sales price primarily by reducing incentives and to a lesser extent, by raising base prices. Markets remain very fluid, and we're making proactive strategic decisions and adjustments every day. As Stuart said, we're committed as a management team to address any future market changes quickly. As we said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine going, maintain our sales and start pace and price our homes to market. This is our balance sheet first focus. Before I turn it over to Jon, I'd like to discuss our land life strategy and community count. Much of our balance sheet and inventory management progress was driven by the execution of our land strategy while simultaneously driving sales, delivery and managing production. Quarter after quarter, we've worked with our strategic land partners and land banks to develop relationships for them to purchase land on our behalf and deliver just-in-time finished home sites to our homebuilding machine on a monthly and quarterly basis. In the first quarter, about 90% of our 12,000 home sites were purchased for finished home sites from our various land structures. We have continued to make significant progress on our land life strategy. This was evidenced at the end of our first quarter, our years' supply of owned home sites improving to 1.9 years from 2.7 years and our controlled home site percentage increasing to 68% from 63% year-over-year. We've also focused on increasing our community count to drive future growth. Our community count increased 1% to 12,017 communities at the end of the first quarter from the year ago period, and we expect to increase our community count in the high single digits from the first quarter by the end of the fiscal year. Given our development time lines, the bulk of these communities will come on in our fourth quarter. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe : Thank you, Rick. You've heard from Stuart and Rick how we remain focused on finding market community by community to maintain sales pace. Accordingly, this does enable Lennar to keep our production machine moving forward with starts. We continue with our stated construction strategy of being a production-first homebuilder, keeping starts consistent and then matching the sales pace to establish sort space to effectively manage inventory. This resulted in ending our first quarter with only about one inventory home per community. To remind you, our construction playbook has three primary areas of focus: lowering construction costs, reducing cycle time and achieving even flow production. By executing this playbook, we believe we can maximize financial results in all market conditions. Let me address each area. As we noted last quarter, the speed of change in market conditions has caused a sharp reduction in industry-wide starts and permits. This is evidenced in the nationally reported starts and permit activity over the last three months, with November, December and January starts down year-over-year at 34%, 27% and 27% while permits were down 30%, 35% and 40%, respectively, in the same year-over-year period. Declining starts and the drop in permits which are a proxy for a further drop in future starts has already and will continue to free up the availability of labor and material. Looking at our first quarter. As expected, construction costs fell sequentially from Q4 by about 1%. This was driven primarily by the reduction in lumber costs from last summer, flowing through our deliveries, partially offset by the increases in cost in most other categories. Year-over-year construction costs rose by almost 13%, reflecting the elevated cost environment for home constructions -- for homes started in 2022 versus 2021. Importantly, in our first quarter, we continue to make progress working with our trade partners to reduce the cost of labor and materials. Additionally, we have now evaluated all of our product lines for appropriate specification changes and we maintain an ongoing value engineering review process across all of our divisions. As I have already noted, there's in starts and permits in the industry, and our trade partners feel this first-hand. We continuously meet with them to communicate our strategy of maintaining our stock space, which they greatly appreciate. They also understand the steps we have taken in sacrifice margin in order to keep our sales pace and to support our volume. In churn, they have partnered with us to lower our construction costs as they know we are helping to keep them in their businesses financially stable. They understand the mission, they're on board to help us make it happen. We expect to start seeing these savings begin to flow through our second quarter closings, which are factored into our margin guidance. Last quarter, I communicated we had identified about $14,000 per home and construction cost savings which will flow through our closings in the back half of the year. We have now contracted these cost savings and continue to make progress on identifying additional savings, while at the same time managing through an environment where certain material costs are impacted by inflationary pressures. Potential future headwind to cost savings is lumber, as the combination of reduced supply from the mills and minimal inventory quantities throughout the distribution channels sets up for the potential for a small price rally in lumber over the next few months. At this time, we are comfortable in reaffirming at least $14,000 per home in savings, which will serve us well should home prices come under further pressure again. Cycle time is the second area of focus for our construction strategy. As Stuart noted, our closings in the first quarter saw extended cycle times as those homes were impacted by the supply chain challenges in the second half of 2022. For the quarter, cycling time increased 14 days and 8 days year-over-year and sequentially, respectively. As we move into the second quarter and beyond, we will continue to close more of the home started last year, which were heavily impacted by supply chain disruptions, eliminating those longer duration of homes from our inventory. Our cycle time also benefits from the greater availability of material and labor due to the significant reduction in housing starts. As we've previously discussed, our overall cycle time increased about two months from pre pandemic conditions. The bulk of this affected the front end of construction as there are fewer opportunities to build out a sequence at the front end as compared to the back end. For example, we can't put on the roof without the wall, but we can install sorters throughout the windows. There has been significant improvement in recapturing on time at the front end. By the end of our first quarter, we have reduced front-end cycle time by over two weeks from our peak. Currently, we are on a pace of improving cycle time by a few days each week. We will have to wait and see how long this trend can be maintained or potentially even approve the fund. This will depend on some lingering supply chain issues such as transformers, labor remaining in the workforce as tort decline and appropriate staffing levels at municipalities. Reducing our cycle time over the next few quarters will free up a significant amount of cash that is tied up in our inventory further strengthening our balance sheet.  The third area of focus is even flow production. Prior to the pandemic and its related supply chain disruption, even flow production was a core focus for us. Even flow properly executed with consistent completions throughout the month and quarter, consistent starts and completions allow both Lennar and our trade partners to be staffed for the average versus the peaks and avoiding efficiencies at the [valleys]. This drives fuel and SG&A efficiencies for both the trade and Lennar. While we are not there yet, as we look forward at our planned deliveries for each month of the second quarter, we can start to see a return to even flow. These strategies are an intense focus -- everyday focus of the entire company. Everyone at Lennar involved in operations and purchasing are focused on every single day on lowering cost, reducing cycle times and achieving even flow production. I would now like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette : Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our Financial Services and Lennar Other segments in our balance sheet and then provide high-level boundaries for Q2 2023. So starting with Financial Services. For the first quarter, our Financial Services team produced operating earnings of $78 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $59 million compared to $67 million in the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by lower loss volume, primarily as a result of the decline in the average sales price of our homes. Title operating earnings were $23 million compared to $21 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and the decrease in cost per transaction as the team continues to achieve efficiencies through technology. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great synergies between our Homebuilding and Financial Services teams as they successfully executed together through this challenging market. So then looking at our Lennar Other Segment for the first quarter, this segment had an operating loss of $41 million. The loss was primarily the result of noncash mark-to-market losses on our publicly traded technology investments, which totaled $24 million.  And then turning to our balance sheet. There is a constant drumbeat at Lennar to be laser-focused on returns and on cash flow. This quarter, we were unwavering with our determination to turn our inventory and generate cash by pricing homes to market to deliver as many homes as possible. The drumbeat continued with our determination to preserve cash and increase asset efficiency by continuing to be judicious about land purchases acquiring primarily finished homesites where vertical construction will soon begin. The results of these steadfast strategies was that we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility, as we've noted. This provided a total of approximately $6.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity. Given our continued focus on balance sheet efficiency, we enhanced our goal of becoming land lighter. At quarter end, we owned 125,000 home sites and controlled 264,000 home sites for a total of 389,000 home sites. Our years own improved to 1.9 years from 2.7 years in the prior year, and our home sites controlled increased to 68% from 63% in the prior year. We believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow market share in a capital-efficient way. During the quarter, we started about 13,300 homes and ended the quarter with approximately 36,500 total homes in inventory, of which about 1,300 were completed unsold as we successfully managed our finished inventory levels. Consistent with our commitment to strategic capital allocation, we repurchased 2 million shares totaling about $189 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $108 million.  And then looking at our debt maturity profile, our next senior note maturity is $400 million, which is due in fiscal 2024. We continue to benefit from our paydown of debt. You may recall that we've repaid about $5.4 billion of senior notes, which equates to about $300 million in interest savings. Combined with strong earnings, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 14.2% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which was an improvement from 18.3% in the prior year. And just a few final points on our balance sheet. We remain committed to increasing shareholder returns. Our stockholders' equity increased to $24 billion. Our book value per share increased to over $84, our return on inventory was approximately 31% and our return on equity was approximately 21%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant confidence in financial flexibility as we move through 2023. And with that brief overview, I'd like to turn our thoughts to Q2. It continues to be difficult to issue the targeted guidance that we have historically provided given the volatility in market conditions. So as Stuart mentioned, and as we did last quarter, we're providing very broad ranges to give some boundaries for each of the components of our second quarter.  So let's start with new orders. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 17,000 homes and expect our Q2 ending community count to be flat to slightly up year-over-year. We anticipate our Q2 deliveries to be in the range of 15,000 to 16,000 homes, and our Q2 average sales price should be in the range of 435,000 to 445,000 as we continue to price to market. We expect gross margins to be in the range of 21% to 21.5% and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 7.2% and 7.4%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect to have earnings of about $10 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q2 to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million, and we expect a loss of about $20 million for each of our multifamily business and the Lennar Other category. The Lennar Other estimate does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.6% to 1.7% of total revenues, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5% and the weighted average share count should be approximately 286 million shares. And so when you pull all that together, these estimates should produce an EPS range in between $2.10 to $2.55 per share for the second quarter. Finally, once again, given market volatility, we're providing boundaries for deliveries only first full year 2023 as we did last quarter, as Stuart mentioned, this delivery range should be 62,000 to 66,000, which is an increase of our previous range of 60,000 to 65,000. We look forward to giving you another update on our next earnings call. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.
Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Super interesting times and very impressive results. Wanted to ask a first question, if I could, about your commentary and your guidance on orders. So I think you indicated that your February absorptions were running at 4.7 sales per community. Your order guidance for 2Q seems to imply something less than that. I was curious why that is? And because we usually see, if anything, the absorption higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And if demand exceeds what seems to be implied in your order guide, would you expect that we might see that excess show up in a higher margin or greater starts?
Stuart Miller: We're struggling with who should answer that question. Hold on please.
Jon Jaffe : David, it's Jon. I think our view, as you heard is that we found -- building the market as we've made what we think of the approach, stroke adjustments to achieve a pace. It's really at a pace that I defined it in my discussion points really matches our start pace. And so it's a managed community by community, market by market sales pace that we think is very healthy as you look at it relative to the year-over-year and the current market environment.
Stuart Miller : I think it's most important to recognize, Steve, that when you look at the overview the overall numbers, they might not match up perfectly with the fact that we are managing our business and managing each of these numbers from a community by community base -- community by community basis. And it's really a roll-up of exactly what's happening in the field in each community. And so you're going to see some anomalies in the numbers. Your question as to whether if demand is stronger, we're going to see that reflected in higher volume numbers or higher margins. And it's really the answer to that is really going to be about optimizing to both. We will, with greater demand see some greater volume but additionally, that greater demand will express itself through our dynamic pricing model and the ability to garner a higher sales price and margin.
Jon Jaffe : Additionally, one more important thought on that. And that is, as you know, we really have a very welcome inventory position, not a lot of unsold homes in front of us are current. So we're very disciplined about not getting too far ahead in sales. We could potentially open it up some more. But we find very effective use of mortgage rate buy-downs, which tend to lend to a shorter cycle duration in in terms of how far out we're selling.
Stephen Kim : Yes, that's exactly where I was going to go next. So thanks for that segue. So I know you have this dynamic pricing model. One of the things that we've really noticed recently, and I'm curious if you have as well, is that homebuyers seem to prefer QMIs much more even than they did, quick move-in homes than they did in the past. And so I would imagine that you could probably actually reduce the level of incentive that you need to offer as your spec homes near completion, which is something very different from the way things were in the past. And so I'm curious, is that true? Are you finding that you can actually reduce incentives as your specs get further along the construction process? And has your dynamic pricing model adjusted to reflect that change?
Rick Beckwitt : Steve, it's Rick. We have seen that our homes as they're getting close to completion or being completed that they get premium pricing. That's why we continued with our production strategy to keep homes coming off of the conveyor belt, if you will. And as I mentioned in my commentary, that's reflective of the lowering of incentives on a monthly basis, really on a weekly basis since for the last six, eight, 10 weeks, we've been able to lower the amount of the incentive. That's why we're keeping our start cadence going. And just going back to your sales pace question, the sales pace for the Q2 is really in the mid-4s. And if the market improves, we can definitely push that. But that's sort of the middle of the fairway type of projection.
Stuart Miller : I do think it's important to note that last night I finished writing my remarks and talked a bit about volatility in my remarks. Little did I know that this morning I’d wake up and see even increased volatility. I say that as an overlay to all of the discussion around numbers looking forward. Have to be looked at in the context of very strange and moving market conditions.
Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much. Stuart, appreciate that. And we will take the 3.4% 10-year yield, though, to this morning.
Stuart Miller : Absolutely. We'll see what the other numbers look like.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates.
Alan Ratner : First, just I was hoping to reconcile a little bit of Stuart and Rick's comments earlier just as far as kind of the late February, early March activity and how that pertains to the overall pricing from you that at least in your opinion, sales have remained steady here through the first couple of weeks of March and not to parse too finally between weekly data. But Stuart, your comments were that you did see a little bit of a tick lower in late February from the higher rates. And obviously, that's a rearview mirror now, but now the banking headlines are taking over. So I guess I'm just curious, A, can you reconcile those comments? And B, given that you think pricing has kind of found a market clearing price, so to speak, if orders were to fade a bit, at what point would you get more aggressive on incentivizing again or adjusting prices to bring that sales pace up?
Stuart Miller : Well, the answer to your last question is every day. We're looking at pricing on an everyday basis in each community. It's a very granular assessment. To reconcile what I said about the end of February, at the end of February, interest rates started moving dramatically in a different direction, and we definitely saw direct impact in traffic levels. We were intrigued to sit, watch as we went from February into March that our sales pace remained relatively strong. There are a number of ways to read that information. But we -- a big part of our read is the fact that we have kind of entered into a world of a new normal relative to interest rates, the sticker shock of the rapid change is subsiding. It doesn't mean it's gone away. But at the same time, interest rate movements are not disrupting sales as they might have 6 months or nine months ago. And we are able to find and keep in touch in step with interest rate movements and that intersection between the discounting that we might have to do, the incentives we might have to get and the consumers' affordability assessment. So all of those are in play on a regular basis. And as we came to the end of February, we definitely saw an impact on traffic but not really much of an impact on sales. That's anomalous.
Jon Jaffe : Alan, it's Jon. I think there's a connection of a point that sort of made and that is as interest rate rates went up, we pulled on the lever of mortgage rate buydowns to keep our customers who were in the queue moving forward with a purchase decision. That's, I think, part of why we didn't see an impact to our sales, while we're seeing an impact to our travel.
Rick Beckwitt : And just a final comment I'd make is we did see stability going into the first two weeks of March, didn't see much variation in the aggregate number of sales in the first two weeks. Incentives ticked down and cancellation rates really stayed in that stable zone for the two weeks prior and really the month of February.
Alan Ratner : Appreciate that. That's all really helpful. Second, I know it's early and this can kind of take a lot of different directions here. But given the uncertainty in the regional banking sector today, on one hand, you guys and the other publics are a huge advantage over private builders given your long-term debt and the balance sheet and the strength that you have. But if you think about the industry more holistically, it's so reliant on debt financing from the regional banks that may be coming up to a tougher period here in the near term which could result in some tightening, whether it's on AD&C financing or build for rent purchases, anything that kind of utilizes that capital. So maybe this one is best for Stuart. How do you see this playing out, if there are any headwinds or tightening that might occur? And how could that impact your business even if you do have that competitive advantage from a capital perspective?
Stuart Miller : So Alan, your question is a really important one, and I don't think there's a clean clear answer to it. And I was very intentional in my comments, I use the words unintended consequences. There are so many of them just swirling around out there. And I'm not sure how they're going to shake out. You're absolutely right that the community banking and regional banking system is a support structure for the broader housing market, whether it's the smaller builders or all the way through the system. The SFR buyers are going to feel the ripple of not only cost of capital but also capitalization rates. There's going to be moving upward. There's going to be movement downward. And how it shakes out is going to be something that we'll be very tuned to. But the landscape is going to shift. Unintended consequences are not -- we're not going to be able to see around those corners. And I think we've seen that in many ways over just the past few days, the unexpected has happened, and we just had to think about how we deal with it, whether it's over the weekend or whether it's over last night. So it's important to daylight that there are these things out there that are going to have some ripple effects, and we'll all have to just sit and see how we deal with them. I hope that I laid out well in our commentary that our strategic focus is taking into account the volatility, the unexpected and recognizing that we're going to stay very close to the market on a community-by-community basis and use our dynamic pricing model digital marketing platform to keep the production machine moving, and that will impact both sales prices and margins.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.
Susan Maklari: My first question is going back to the dynamic pricing model, you mentioned in your comments that you are constantly refining and improving that process. Are there any specifics that you can give us around that? And especially given the volatility that we've seen in rates over the last couple of months, how has that helped you to adjust on the ground? And giving you the confidence to give us those guidance or those boundaries for your '23 closings of 62,000 to 66,000?
Jon Jaffe : Hey, Susan, it's Jon. Our dynamic pricing model really gives us a very clear view of the different elements that go into pricing home and associated incentives, mortgage buydowns, base pricing premiums, et cetera. So we've evolved that product through these market conditions. We've developed additional tools within dynamic pricing that give our operators that view of what's happening on a plan-by-plan community-by-community basis where they can track week over week changes in base pricing, incentives, et cetera, and stay very much on top of sales pace, what's needed and what is having the biggest impact on driving results.
Stuart Miller : As well as the competitive landscape. 
Jon Jaffe : Yes.
Stuart Miller: All of the components of what's happening in the market is being ingested into our dynamic pricing model, and it is giving in graphic form our operators a clear view of what's happening in their market, backward-looking and forward expected. And it's really the ingestion of data, the backward testing and the ability to accumulate more information that is dependable that we -- where we build and understanding as to what it means that helps us come up with pricing that is actionable in the field on a market-by-market basis. And probably the most interesting thing that has taken place over the last six months is a better understanding of how to look at our underperforming assets, meaning the communities that are not performing up to par. It's easy to focus on the communities that are doing quite well and harder to focus on the ones that might be lagging and across a platform that's 1,300 communities coast-to-coast. It's important to zero-in on those that are underperforming and see what it takes to get them moving in the right direction. That's what our dynamic pricing model is all about.
Rick Beckwitt : It also allows us to identify the ones that are performing well from a sales pace. But that need pricing adjustments to the upside because we're not maximizing the value of the opportunities.
Jon Jaffe : And it’s about the foundation that really enables our -- all to work is we have a set start pace and we're trying to land on a sales pace that ties into a matches that start pace. So we know where we want to land, and then enterprising helps us navigate to make sure that we land on the spot that we want to.
Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. That's all very helpful. And then turning to the balance sheet, you've got probably the strongest balance sheet you've ever had, especially given the operating conditions right now. Historically, when we've gone through periods of slowdowns or the global financial crisis, you've been able to leverage certain opportunities to drive long-term growth. Obviously, it's really hard to know how things will come together this time. But what are some of the things that you're looking out for? Where do you think there could be opportunities to take advantage of? And how are you thinking about investing in long-term growth relative to, say, shareholder returns or other uses of the balance sheet?
Stuart Miller : So Susan, let me say emphatically that our primary focus is on organic growth. We are not really looking outside of strategic opportunities and being opportunistic in a kind of traditional sense. We are -- and I've said this many times before, we are focused on being a best-of-breed homebuilder, manufacturer with an asset-light program. We're going to be focused on generating cash, paying down debt, buying back stock, where opportunistically we can and should. And we're not really looking outside the boundaries. We think that the opportunity to continuously improve, as I said, continuous improvement is a serious motto around here. Continuously improved is the biggest opportunity that we have, and we are refining all of the levers of our company down to or up to the actual operators that run the business across the board, its continuous improvement internally focused and that opportunistic skill set that we clearly have is not our primary focus right now. The strength of our balance sheet is not enabling us to and our thinking. We're staying very focused on running our business and refining it. And that asset-light componentry continues to be right in the crosshairs of what we're focused on, how do we systematically build a land strategy that is complementary of a land light programming that enables us to execute well and to grow for the future.
Rick Beckwitt : I think consistent with that on the margin, the opportunities that might come on individual community-by-community basis is if things on a regional level with the smaller builders, smaller developers where they need capital, we can put that in one of our land vehicles.
Operator: And our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research.
Unidentified Analyst: Actually, this is [Paul Sadowski]. First question, your order ASP increased 3% to 7% quarter-over-quarter on a regional basis. You did dimension that was pricing power. But I can't imagine pricing power drove all that. Was it more the balanced product or geographic submarket mix, et cetera? And then following on that, what percent of your communities have actually come off the bottom in order pricing?
Rick Beckwitt : So as I said in my comments, most of the price increase between Q4 and Q1 was really mix of product with some incentive reductions, that was the primary impact between Q4 and Q1. As far as the percentage of communities, I'm not sure we have that right now. That's the...
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. Well, the second question, your first quarter gross margin came in a little bit about guidance. The midpoint on 2Q is basically flat. In the last quarter, you mentioned that you thought you thought 1Q would kind of be the low point for the year. Do you continue to believe that the second half of '23 will see higher margins relative to the first half?
Stuart Miller : Generally, we do. I do want to just correct one term and that is that term guidance. We've used the word boundaries. I know there's a subtle difference there, but we are trying to give some boundaries, but we do recognize that the world is working a little strangely these days. With that said, we do feel that our margins should be better in the back half of the year as some of our cost savings and work with our building partners kind of start to flow through. Remember, there's a lag and what we're able to engage with our building partners and what actually -- the timing of which is actually flows through our numbers. But we are anticipating that the second half should be a little bit stronger, assuming that conditions in the market don't radically move in a different direction.
Operator: And our next question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.
Carl Reichardt : Stuart, you talked about turns at 1.2x, inventory turns. So if you think about like selling at a normalized pace for Lennar, getting back to normal cycle times and optimizing the land like program in hunky-dory world, where do you think those inventory turns can go?
Stuart Miller : So we've spent a lot of time thinking about this call. We think it's a very important metric for us. And I'm not prepared to make that prediction. What I want to say that it is very much at the center of our thinking, and there are some cross currents right now because of the reconciliation of supply chain disruption and some of the holdovers and the reconciliation of that supply chain disruption getting our cycle times back in line will be a factor in the answer to that question, and let's leave the answer to that in another day, but just understand that it's very much part of the focus of our management team.
Carl Reichardt : Okay. I had to take the shot at least. And then on Quarterra, obviously, you've postponed that, what are the conditions necessary do you think to actually get that business spun under the assumption that you still intend to do that?
Stuart Miller : I'll answer it in the negative and say not the conditions that we've seen unfold over the past couple of weeks. We are -- look, there's -- as I said last quarter, the markets are moving and the financial markets have created complication. Since that last quarterly call, I would say that the capital markets have become even a bit more complicated. This is just not the time for us to be taking Quarterra to the market. I think that we're going to wait and see and look for the right opportunity to do the next right thing for the company. And I want to leave that as an open item as well. I feel like I'm not answering your questions, Carl. It's not like me.
Carl Reichardt : That's quite right. I appreciate all the color, guys. Thanks so much.
Stuart Miller : We have time to two more, please.
Operator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut : The first question, I just wanted to circle back to -- I believe it was Jon's comments on that 14,000 of savings per home that you feel like you've been able to achieve, I guess, maybe over the last, I don't know, call it, three to six months. That against your second quarter closing ASP, that's a little over 300 basis points of margin improvement. So I'm just trying to think about -- you mentioned earlier about still expecting some amount of improvement in second quarter -- I'm sorry, second half gross margins provided the pricing and incentive backdrop remain relatively stable. It seems like you're a little more hesitant to kind of say, okay, back half gross margins up by 300. Are there other things that we should be considering that would offset that? Is this more of a fiscal '24 event? Just trying to think about those savings and how they might flow through in the back half.
Stuart Miller : So Mike, before I let Jon comment, let me just say that you hit the nail on the head. I think that it's the general volatility that is sending up the caution flag that, yes, you're correct. We are working every day on expanding that number to a larger number, and it is not static. And if you just look at numbers, your assessment is correct. But with that said, we're leaving room for volatility to run its course. We recognize that even things within the cost numbers are moving around. Whether it's lumber costs moving down and then moving back up, whether it's other components. So the answer is yes, we're leaving some room for other elements of volatility to express themselves as well. Go ahead Jon.
Jon Jaffe : Yes. So for Q2, as I mentioned, you're just seeing the very beginnings of that because there is a time lag that Stuart addressed a moment ago. We put something under contract today, it affects homes we start tomorrow, which delivered call it six months from now. So you have that timing cycle. You do have a likelihood that lumber does move up some. We are battling, for example, in aggregates and concrete as a headwind. There is a constant energy efficiency battle that goes on that affects our manufacturers. So it's give and take in that, and that's why I said we feel comfortable with what we have put under contract so far. But it's all about. And so you shouldn't do the math where you apply 100% of that because there will be offsets.
Michael Rehaut : Okay. That's very helpful and makes sense. I guess maybe even increasing the focus to the second quarter instead of the second half we're getting even shorter term, you guided to roughly flat gross margins in the second quarter versus the first. And what struck me on that guidance is that at the same time, you've been talking about during the call, incentives, I think Rick kind of referred to incentives declining over the past, I think I heard six to 10 weeks, and maybe there was a little bit of a bump up in the end of February, but then a bump down, I guess, in March. Why wouldn't we see a little bit of that in the second quarter in terms of the gross margins? And again, is there any offset there? Or is this more of a 3Q, 4Q type of benefit?
Rick Beckwitt : I think it's more of a Q3, Q4 type of benefit. But if you look at our guidance, we've pushed up to 21.5, which incorporates some of that improvement. And the thing you need to think about incentives is incentive is one part of the equation. The base price is another. And occasionally, we have to adjust base prices down because ultimately, we're really focused on net pricing. So we feel that we will get a benefit from the reduction in incentives and net pricing as we move through the year. So we're at the beginning stages of really stabilized markets and making the improvements as volume and traffic change.
Stuart Miller : Bottom line is a lot of moving parts in all of these, Mike. And the way it plays out over the quarter, especially in the near term. It's going the moving parts are all going to work together and we're going to roll it up. So you're seeing the injection of some rational conservatism to just make sure we're including the volatility in the market that is moving things all around.
Stuart Miller : Great. Last question please.
Operator: Our final question comes from Matthew Bouley from Barclays.
Matthew Bouley : So one follow-up on everything going on around the banking system. You laid out some sort of broader industry thoughts there. And I very much recognize is very fluid, but just kind of pertaining to your own mortgage business. Kind of lay out or unpack kind of as you guys go through the process of selling loans to the secondary mortgage market, do you have any exposure to the regional banking system there? And just any sort of higher level thoughts on how all this may impact lending standards and all that?
Stuart Miller : We're going to let Bruce chime in on that. Nice to hear you this morning Bruce.
Bruce Gross : Nice to be here. With respect to sales of loans to investors, we have the agencies that we sell to and other parties that are not regional banks. Some of those investors did have financing from regional banks. We're paying very close attention to that, but no disruption. And the backdrop is we could always sell to the agencies. So we feel very good about the sales to investors. Our warehouse lines are primarily the big commercial banks. So very little regional bank component with the warehouse line. So we're in really good shape, we vetted that. This is an experienced team that's been through the financial crisis back in 2008 and '09. So we have the playbook and we've reacted very quickly, and we feel very comfortable.
Stuart Miller : Yes. Let me also say that capital markets are pretty fluid, especially around established products like the mortgage product. There more than the regional banks. Some of the insurance companies are starting to look at some of these spaces. And I think we have a high degree of confidence that we'll be able to fill any void that temporarily show up.
Matthew Bouley : Wonderful. All right. Thanks you Stuart and Bruce. Perfect color there. Second one, just you mentioned at the top around land and it sounds like prices are very sticky and you're trying to push back on that. I think you said you'd eventually see kind of a lagged benefit to margins, if I heard you correctly. I'm just curious if you can elaborate a little on what you're doing to kind of push back and kind of get the land market where you think it should be at this stage?
Stuart Miller : Look, at the end of the day, land value is a residual of what it can be used for. And the residual land value off of residential land is relative to the price or sales price of the home. What makes land value somewhat sticky is the expectation that perhaps home prices have come down, but they'll bounce back up. And therefore, the old residual might come back into play and landholders will sometimes wait. At the end of the day, we're finding that we're coming into a new sense of normal. And I have to believe that if landholders land owners want to generate cash and sell products. Ultimately, the valuation is going to have to revert to kind of that new normal of home pricing and the end use of the land, and there will be that rational relationship between land cost and ultimate home price. We are patiently waiting for that to reconcile and we're doing it because we're simply not going to buy the land that's going to put us under water or by the next impaired margin. And so we are going to but our time. If the market corrects to the upside, we'll pay a little bit more. But if it stays kind of situated where it is, quite sure that land sellers will come around to understanding that there is a new valuation that has to come into play.
Jon Jaffe : Just for clarity, operationally, we're really staying very close to all land that is out there, so that as it does ebb and flow, we are in that flow, know what's going on and can make decisions quickly.
Stuart Miller : Right. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt : And I think there's no doubt that the land market, the land sellers are seeing the permits and starts activity that Jon highlighted. I think some of them are getting a little bit nervous. They all think they had the last piece of land that can be acquired or developed. Jon, I have heard that comment for the last 20 years. There's always more than in the last piece of land. So we're being very careful or underwriting specifically to today's prices for respectable and strong margins. And if the deals make sense, we're going to structure them really well, and we'll move forward with them.
Stuart Miller : So let me just say, and I guess, concluding along these lines is they say it takes a village. Well, in the homebuilding world, it's the homebuilder, the land seller and the building partners or the trade, all working together and recognizing the current pricing is going to define in the future. With that, I want to say thank you to everybody for joining us, and we look forward to reporting again in the future as we report future quarters. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may disconnect your line, and please enjoy the rest of your day.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, I'm here in Miami and joined by Rick Beckwitt, our co-CEO and co-President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross is here, our CEO of Lennar Financial Services. Happy to have Bruce back in the seat. And of course, Alex, who you just heard from. Jon Jaffe, our co-CEO and President is on -- is out in California and on the line and will participate remotely. As usual, I'm going to give a macro overview and strategic overview of the Company. I'll be a little longer than usual. We've got some strategic matters that we want to cover. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to walk through our markets as he did last time around. Jon's going to update supply chain, cycle time and construction costs, and give a little overview on land as well. I think that Rick and Jon will both talk a little bit about land. As usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight and we'll give some rough boundaries for the first quarter to assist in looking forward, thinking and modeling. And then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit yourselves to one question and one follow up. So, let me go ahead and begin by saying that once again, the Lennar team has turned in excellent results for the fourth quarter and year-end 2022, which continue to enhance our positioning for evolving market conditions. Market conditions continue to deteriorate in the fourth quarter as the now well-documented interest rate driven sales slowdown and pricing correction intersected with the still stressed supply chain, high labor and material costs and elongated cycle times to make for a very complicated landscape to bring the year 2022 to a close. The very sudden movement in interest rates experienced over the past six months has very quickly affected both, affordability and consumer confidence, resulting in a very rapid change in market conditions and demand. Sales and sales prices are down materially across both, the new and existing home markets and given commercial underwriting and lending criteria, new for rent properties are being curtailed as well. Our current view is that production of single family and multifamily dwellings nationally will be down between quarter to a third in 2023, exacerbating the national housing supply shortage. Numerically that means that approximately 1.5 million homes produced over the past couple of years per year will drop to around 1 million homes produced. Now, Rick's going to go through market review and market conditions across our platform in a few minutes. So, stay tuned for that. But even as demand has cooled very quickly, the overhang of a now correcting, although disrupted supply chain, stubbornly high labor and materials costs and production or cycle times that have grown by over two months, have created an unusual wedge that the home builders have been left to navigate. Jon will give a lot more detail on that. On a positive note, very limited new home inventory exists. Limited existing home supply exists as existing homeowners hold on to extremely low mortgage rates and very limited multifamily production combines with the chronic housing production shortfall over the past decade and leaves the industry in the middle of what we believe will be a fairly short duration correction without an inventory overhang to resolve. Against this backdrop, in addition to the two hurricanes that swept through Florida, the home building and financial services team at Lennar have focused and have executed on the strategies that we've detailed over the past quarters as we have very quickly and efficiently adjusted our business and business model. We laid out that -- the Lennar strategy playbook over the past quarters and those strategies, the successes and the misses are reflected in our first quarter and year-end results. And I'd like to give a brief overview. So, first, as the first playbook strategy, we detailed that we are going to continue to sell homes and adjust pricing to market conditions and maintain reasonable volume. In fact, we relied on our proprietary dynamic pricing model developed by our inimitable Jeff Moses to guide to volume-based pricing in order to drive sales at market pricing so that we maintain the volume that maintains our starts and sales base, so they remain in sync and drive steady production. The result of this program is that margin as opposed to volume becomes the so-called shock absorber, and fluctuates up and down like an accordion as market conditions especially interest rates change. Accordingly, interest rate changes, especially downward, potentially improve lagging margins. In the fourth quarter, we saw our margins adjust rather quickly, down some 270 basis points to 25.3% before impairments as we used price reductions plus incentives in the form of both, closing cost payments and interest rate buy downs to offset volatile interest rate and market shifts. We did this both to sell homes as well as to protect our backlog by adjusting pricing and incentives to ensure closings. While our cancellation rate of 26% is decidedly higher than the 12% last year, it has been falling from the peak of 28% reached in October, and we expect it to normalize below 20% in the near future. Also in the fourth quarter, we used our pricing strategy to in orderly fashion maintain our volume. While our sales were still down some 15% year-over-year, that result has compared favorably to reported market conditions and enabled us to start over 68,000 homes in 2022, which is only a 1% reduction year-over-year and gives us visibility to potentially flat 2023 deliveries. While this is not intended to be a projection, it is within the broad boundaries of our outlook ahead. We derive confidence in our ability to achieve sales base at the best possible prices from our significant investment in digital marketing, which is more relevant than ever before. Our proprietary digits platform, which we built on a Microsoft backbone, provides digital marketing insights and analytics that guide us to better execution with appropriate pricing from our dynamic pricing model. Our digital marketing team under the guidance of Ori Klein, is doing some very interesting, innovative, and very credible work. Our second playbook strategy was to work with our trade partners to right size our cost structure to current market conditions. On this item, let me say that Jon will cover this in great detail shortly, but Jon, together with Rick is giving a master class on cost reconciliation across our platform to our production and our purchasing teams, as well as to our trade partners. Make no mistake, Lennar led the way with reduction in margin, while maintaining volume and increasing market share as the market has corrected. We expect our trade partners to work side by side with us and follow suit. As margins expand -- expanded in the best of times, they benefited; and as margins have now contracted in the more difficult times, we are driving costs down as prices are reduced and we expect participation as well. While there is no doubt a lag in those reductions coming through our -- there is no doubt, a lag in those reductions coming through our reported numbers; there will also be no doubt a significant reduction coming, period. Cost reductions will improve lagging margins. Our third playbook articulated strategy was to sharpen our attention on land and land acquisitions. While Rick and Jon will give additional detail on our land reviews, this has been a specific concentrated focus by all three of us, myself, Rick, and Jon, across the platform, working, connected and together to reconsider every land deal in our pipeline and minimize exposure to falling land values. In that regard, I dare say we have stopped the bleeding early. We have reconsidered every land deal in our pipeline; we have reconsidered land development dollars being spent; we have walked from deposits or renegotiated terms and price; and we have been relentless in focusing on protecting cash and only purchasing the next strong margin at today's pricing. Newland purchases will improve lagging margins. Fortunately, we are well-positioned with well-structured contracts and shorter-term deal structures that enable our capital allocation to be micromanaged constructively. We started the quarter with $2.5 billion of expected land closings. We ended the quarter with three quarters of that spend, either walked from, renegotiated to produce a responsible margin or pushed for reconsideration at a later time. As with our trade partners, our land partners or sellers understand that we are maintaining volume and increasing market share while taking the first hit to our margin. They will need to work together and participate or we'll need to move on. Our fourth playbook strategy was to manage our operating costs for our SG&A so that even at lower gross margins, we will drive a strong net margin, and as much as we have been driving our SG&A down over the past years, quarter-by-quarter to new record lows. And many of those changes, although not all are hardwired into permanent efficiencies in operations. Nevertheless, as average sales prices come down, the percentages won't hold without corresponding additional cuts. We also know that in more difficult times, there will be an upward pressure on some of our sales and marketing costs in order to drive and find purchasers, and drive new sales. In our fourth quarter, we were able to maintain our 5.8% SG&A at the operating level. And we believe if we continue to drive volume, we'll be able to contend increases and manage to a very attractive cost level. Each of our operating teams, as well as our corporate teams are looking for additional efficiencies, especially now that COVID is behind us, and teams are reconvening in person in our offices and finding those inefficiencies face-to-face and together. Our fifth playbook strategy was to maintain tight inventory control. This is exactly what drives the cash flow machine, and we're focused on this part of our business every day. Both land and home inventory control is the mission control of our overall business. And in our fourth quarter numbers, you can see in our 14.4% debt to total capitalization and our $4.6 billion cash position that our inventory is being carefully managed. Now, we know that the questions have been raised by the press and others about a mysterious 5,000 homes being sold to single family for rent purchasers at deep discount because of dire market conditions. The fact is that we, like other builders, provide a tape of homes available for sale to the single family for rent buyers, so they are aware of what is available in the ordinary course of our business, and we've been doing that over the past many quarters. That tape might have had completed homes and homes that are one to four months out from completion. Over the course of the past year -- and these are the facts, over the course of the past year, we have sold approximately 7% of our homes to single family for rent purchasers, including Quarterra. That percentage is approximately the same range quarter by quarter. And as we look ahead to 2023, we think the percentage will be roughly the same or less. Net margins on those homes are approximately the same as homes sold to primary buyers, and there is no unusual discounting or advantage. In our operating world, our focus is not on fire sales to manage inventory. Instead, it all starts with the starts, sales and closings management of our business. These elements of the business are managed through an every other day management meeting where numbers are reviewed at the regional and divisional levels by the entire management team. Starts, sales and closings are maintained in a controlled balance with the end result of volume that defines expectations. This is the most carefully reviewed and managed part of our business and enables us to maintain an extremely low inventory of completed not sold homes, which has consistently been at or under one home per community for the past years. And right now, we have approximately 900 unsold completed homes. Currently, land inventory is managed equally carefully. From the corporate office, tight oversight is maintained on the land and land development spend. Diane oversees every dollar spent on land acquisitions and development dollars and maintains accountability relative to years of land owned versus controlled and years of land owned overall. If we aren't hitting targets, we aren't spending money. Like with home, there are no fire sales, just careful day-to-day management. We're aware that inventory has grown through the year because of expanded cycle time due to the supply chain disruption. We also know that this inefficiency will correct over the next few quarters and will turn approximately $150 billion of inventory into additional cash and will provide the cash to pay down debt due in 2024. That is on the radar. Additionally, a pause on growth this year will reduce inventory and generate additional cash over the next year as well. Because of the tight control of land and completed home inventory, our cash flow has grown, pushing our balance sheet to the point where our net debt to total capital is actually negative at this point. That makes Diane happy. The sixth playbook strategy was to continue to focus on cash flow bottom line in order to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. If we reflect on our fourth quarter results, it is mission accomplished and we are still just getting started. If we continue to execute our playbook strategies, we will continue to drive strong cash flow and even through bottom line profitability -- and even though bottom line profitability will be compressed year-over-year, as prices and margins are impacted in a correcting market, our balance sheet and cash position will continue to improve. This improvement enables the flexibility to be opportunistic as market conditions stabilize as well as opportunistic in repurchasing both stock and debt. We have tremendous optionality.  Now, the final playbook strategy is the one where we must report a miss. That of course, being the spin of Quarterra by year-end. In spite of our best efforts, in spite of my best efforts, the current market conditions are simply not favorable to our commercial asset manager spin on the year end timeline. Not to be cliché, you just can't and don't want to fight the tape. We believe that we have a very high end public company waiting and almost ready to enter the public arena, but we're going to postpone for the time being and wait for the right timing, Quarterra deserves exactly that launch. While I remain confident, enthusiastic, that Quarterra will be spun and Lennar will become a pure play home builder as promised, it will not happen by year-end, and I'm not prepared to posit another date, given current market uncertainties. So, please be patient. So, at the end of the day, if you're keeping score and are considering success in the difficult market conditions, I believe that we from the Lennar homebuilding team to the Lennar Financial Services team, to the Quarterra team, have had a truly remarkable fourth quarter and year-end 2022. In extraordinarily difficult market conditions, we focused on strategy and we executed with precision. We ended the year with the highest revenues, the highest profit, the highest cash flow, the best balance sheet, and the highest liquidity in Lennar's history. We have a plan of execution to move into the uncertainties of 2023 with a focus on maintaining volume, maximizing margin, managing inventories, driving cash flow, managing land and land spend, and further enhancing our balance sheet, in spite of challenging market conditions. Accordingly, we are guarding our first quarter closings to between 12,000 and13,500 homes with the gross margin of approximately 21%, which we believe will be the lowest gross margin for the year. Additionally, we're targeting delivery volume to be flattish for the full year as we drive volume and pickup market share, and build margins through reconciliation of construction costs and land costs and adjustment to product efficiency, while carefully managing SG&A. We are prepared once again to look adversity square in the eye and stick to our strategies and pull out a big win. Simply put, that's what we expect of ourselves. As a conclusion or an epilogue, let me add that we've come to an end of another year, and we have a truly wonderful leader who will be retiring after 27 years of service. Jeff Roos is one of our Regional Presidents who has overseen many of our western divisions. Jeff has been an absolute warrior of Lennar over these past decades, but as with all great leaders, he leaves us with ample, handpicked talent to fill the void. In fact, his people will be even better than he has been. He wants it that way. While I have a somewhat heavy heart, I feel a great sense of pride to have worked so many years with such a talented partner. Many of you on this call don't know Jeff Roos, and he liked it that way. Jeff is the very essence of Lennar. He is a quiet engine under the hood, never the shiny paint job, extraordinary on the field, always a leader in execution and always willing to learn something new. They say that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Well, Jeff was always the old dog that taught us all new tricks. Off the field, Jeff is even better. He has been ever focused on making the world a better place through HomeAid or diaper drives or anything that works for community. He never stops caring, never stops driving, and you can't help but love everything that he stands for. So, with that said, Jeff is a shining example of all that drives us here at Lennar to be better and to reach higher. And it is Jeff and people just like him that make it a certainty that Lennar will continue to succeed. So, with that, let me turn over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart’s opening comments, the overall housing market has been reacting to a significant increase in mortgage rates, which has impacted affordability and home buyer confidence. While we continue to have many strong markets, in our more challenging areas, we've had to adjust base sales prices, increase incentives, and provide mortgage rate buydowns to maintain or regain sales momentum. As sales strategy -- our sales strategy has been to find the market clearing price for each of our homes on a community by community basis as quickly as possible, and price our homes accordingly. In many cases, we're solving to a monthly payment and not to a sales price. This requires a detailed understanding of community and product specific pricing, financing programs, traffic trends, inventory levels, and buyer sentiments.  During the fourth quarter, our new sales orders declined 15% from the prior year on a 4% lower year over year community count. Our year-end community count was lower than we projected at the beginning of the year as we walked away and renegotiated on many communities. Jon will walk you through this as he discusses our land strategy. While our cancellation rate and sales incentives increased sequentially from the third quarter, our sales orders and sales pace per community was relatively flat throughout the fourth quarter, as we successfully executed our pricing strategy in most of our markets. To maintain and regain sales momentum, our fourth quarter new sales order price declined 9.5% sequentially from our third quarter with mix accounting for 250 basis points of the decline, and base price reductions and incentives, accounting for 200 basis points and 500 basis points, respectively. The combination of adjusted pricing and rate buydowns have created a more stabilized environment. As we cleared out or closed many of our older contracts in our backlog, our backlog has reset to these new prices, admittedly at lower margins, and we're seeing more stability and a trend toward lower cancellation rates. To this point, our cancellation rate peaked in October, declined significantly in November, and we've seen a continued reduction thus far in December. We fundamentally believe that this price to market strategy reflects our balance sheet for its focus, where we can maintain starts and sales, generate cash flow, and keep our home building machine going. To this end, as Jon will discuss, by maintaining our starts pace, we've been able to get cost reductions from our trade partners, and significantly increase our market share as many of our competitors that either stopped or slowed starts altogether. I'd like to now give you an update on our markets across the country. They really fall into three categories: One, markets that are performing well; two, markets where we've adjusted pricing and incentives, found the market price and have successfully regained sales momentum; and three, markets that may require some additional pricing adjustments to regain our targeted absorption pace. During the fourth quarter, and so far in December, we had eight markets that are performing well. These include Southwest Florida, Southeast Florida, Tampa, Palm Atlantic, New Jersey, Charlotte, Indianapolis, and San Diego. These markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory and many are benefiting from strong employment and strong local economies. While these markets continue to be strong, we've had to offer mortgage vote, buydown programs, and normalized incentives. Our category two markets, which reflect markets where we've made more significant adjustments and have successfully regained sales momentum, include 23 markets. These include Jacksonville, Ocala, Atlanta, Coastal Carolinas, Raleigh, Virginia, Maryland, the Philadelphia Metro Area, Chicago, Minnesota, Nashville, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Colorado, Tucson, Las Vegas, California Coastal, the Inland Empire, The Bay Area, Central Valley, Sacramento, Seattle, and Boise. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we've had to offer more aggressive financing, base price reductions, and/or increased incentives to regain sales momentum. The size and adjustments -- the size of the adjustments is varied on a community by community basis and has often been limited to specific homes each week. In some cases, to avoid cancellations, we've had to adjust pricing on our homes in backlog. We’re being very proactive with our pricing and not reactive. This has allowed us to sell homes and avoid building up finished inventory. We're outselling the competition, and as I said, increasing our market share. Our category three markets which reflect the more significant softening and correction include eight markets. These include Orlando, Pensacola, Northern Alabama, Austin, Phoenix, Utah, Reno, and Portland. While the driver of the individual dynamics of these markets vary somewhat, traffic is slowed, buyers are taking more time to purchase and many need to be convinced that now's the time to buy. There is fear that prices haven't hit bottom, which has led to elevated cancellations. In these markets, we're focusing on establishing pricing that generates new growth sales to offset the cancellations, and we have achieved that. This is required to work with our backlog to prevent cancellations. It's also required a mix of base price adjustments, sales incentives, and mortgage buydown programs. While we've made progress in each of these areas, we still need to make some adjustments going forward. There's not a one size fits -- one size fits all solution. I'm confident however that we're making progress in each of these areas and we're very fortunate to have limited completed unsold inventory, so we should be able to get these markets back on track in the first quarter. I hope this gives you a better picture of our markets across the country and what we're doing to keep our sales activity going. The markets are very fluid and we're making proactive strategic decisions and adjustments every day. We are committed as a management team to address any future market changes. And as we've said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine going to maintain our starts and price our homes to market. This is our balance sheet first focus. I’d now like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thank you, Rick. Our well executed strategy of pricing to market to maintain sales volume as Stuart and Rick have detail, set us up for the next part of our game plan, our construction strategies. Simply put, by continuing to sell homes and generate cash flow, we'll keep starting homes. Our construction playbook has three primary areas of focus, lowering construction costs, reducing cycle time, and achieving even flow production. Properly executed, these strategies improve both, gross and net margins, allowing us to profitably continue the cycle of finding the market to sell homes. Let me address each area. Reductions in construction costs have historically lagged the change in market conditions. While that is true this time, what is different is the speed of change in the market conditions has caused a sharp reduction in industry wide starts, thus speeding up the availability of labor and materials for Lennar. This is very quickly turning the shortages of the last two years into excesses. Taking a look back at our fourth quarter, construction costs continue to increase as we guided on our last earnings call. Increases in both materials and labor resulted in a total direct construction cost increase of 6% and 16% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively. Moving forward, our process is a three-pronged approach of first, working with our trade partners to reduce the cost of labor materials; second, evaluating all specifications in the home; and third, an intense value engineering review. We have very strong relationships with our trade partners. We have demonstrated to them that we have taken the first step by lowering sales prices to drive sales, and they understand this and understand the dynamic of labor availability as overall starts slow and they're working closely with us to lower their prices. Since the beginning of our third quarter, we have reduced contracted costs by approximately $14,000 per home, or $6.22 per square foot. And this amount will grow throughout our first and second quarters as reduced demand for labor and materials accelerates. These savings will start to flow through our results in the back half of the second quarter, and will primarily be seen in closings for the second half of the year. What has been a steady increase in construction costs over the last few years will reverse course in our first quarter with a small reduction in cost per square foot compared to our fourth quarter. This is primarily driven by lower lumber costs from earlier in the year. This improvement is already baked into our backlog as these homes started in the last four to six months. Cycle time is the second area of focus for our construction strategy. We see meaningful improvement in this area as cycle time was flat sequentially for the quarter, despite the cumulative effect of supply chain disruptions experiencing the two hurricanes that impacted production in Florida and parts of the Carolinas. Importantly, we saw cycle time improvement during the quarter for the front end of construction, which measures the duration of time from trenching to insulation. This first part of construction process is the first to see labor free-up and came down an average of eight days during the last four weeks of our quarter as compared to the prior four weeks. As Stuart noted, bringing down our cycle time throughout the next few quarters will free up significant amount of cash that is tied up in inventory, further strengthening our balance sheet. The third area of focus is even flow production. Prior to the pandemic and its related supply chain disruptions, even flow production was a core focus for us. It is a key pillar for being the builder of choice for the trades as it maximizes efficiencies for them. The steady pace and rhythm of starts through completions is absolutely critical and is only achieved with real time communication between all parties. From Lennar’s offices and fields to manufacturers, to distributors, to trades, and then back to us, information such as projected start dates and day by day scheduling in the field is enabled with rigorously adhered to technology driven tools and processes. Level construction flow of our homes drives field and G&A efficiencies for both the trades and Lennar open improved margins for both. As Stuart noted, this is an intense focus of both Rick and myself, along with our national, regional and divisional purchasing and construction teams. All of us are focused every single day on lowering cost, reducing cycle time and achieving even flow of production. Turning next to our land light strategy, this focus has been the primary driver of cash flow generation over the past several years, leading to the strongest balance sheet in our company's history. And we have taken it up a notch in the current environment. Quarter-after-quarter, we have worked with our strategic land banks and land partners where we have established relationships to purchase land on our behalf and deliver just in time finish home sites to our homebuilding machine on a quarterly basis. During the fourth quarter, we reassessed every land deal in our pipeline, utilizing updated underwriting, we either restructured the price, the terms, and/or the timing, or we did not proceed with the transaction. The result of this focus was that 75% or approximately $680 million of land purchase in the quarter were just in time deliveries from our land banks or land partners. The remaining $220 million of land purchases were made up of option payments and small short duration land purchases. In fact, about 88% of the land purchased in the first quarter were for transactions under $2 million each. During the quarter, we also terminated contracts totaling about 27,800 home sites. There was approximately $37 million in forfeited land deposits associated with some of these terminations. The ongoing focus on our land light strategy resulted in ending fiscal 2022 with a controlled home site percentage of 63%, up from 59% last year. Additionally, we reduced the years of owned home sites to 2.5 years at the end of the fourth quarter down from three years last year. Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick, and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance, so I don't need to provide any additional details. Therefore, I'll spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet, some points already noted, and then provide high level thoughts for Q1 ‘23. So starting with Financial Services, for the fourth quarter, our Financial Services team produced operating earnings of $125 million. Mortgage operating earnings were $80 million compared to $77 million in the prior year. We benefited from a higher level of lock volume than expected as buyers locked in the attractive rates offered with our interest rate buydown programs. These discounted interest rates provided certainty to our buyers to avoid potential future rate increases.  Title operating earnings were $44 million compared to $30 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volume and a decrease in cost per transaction as the team continues to focus on efficiencies through technology. These solid results were accomplished as a result of great connectivity between our homebuilding and Financial Services teams as they successfully executed together through this choppy environment. Then turning to our Lennar Other segment. For the fourth quarter, the Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $106 million. This loss was primarily the result of non-cash mark to market losses on our publicly traded technology investments, which totaled $96 million. Although, it's been a very tough environment for technology stocks, we have found and continue to believe that there are incremental operating efficiencies through these technology partnerships for both, our homebuilding and Financial Services platforms, as well as greatly improving our home buyer's experience. Then turning to the balance sheet. As we've all noted, this quarter, we were laser-focused on our balance sheet. We focused on pricing to market, turning inventory and thus generating cash as we -- and we also focused on preserving cash by matching our starts pace with our sales pace, and as Jon mentioned, reevaluating every land deal in our pipeline to ensure the underwriting aligned with today's market conditions. The results of these actions is that we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash and no borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $7.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity. During the quarter, we continued our progress of becoming land lighter. At quarter-end, we owned 166,000 home sites and controlled 281,000 home sites, for a total of 447,000 home sites. This translates into 2.5 years owned, which exceeded our year-end goal of 2.75 years owned and was an improvement from three years in the prior year. We controlled 63% of our home sites, which was slightly lower than our goal of 85% since we walked away from approximately 28,000 home sites related to option contracts that we terminated this quarter. Last year's control percentage was 59%. When we calculate our years owned and home sites controlled, we include home sites with vertical construction that is homes in inventory. Since the goal of these calculations is to assess future balance sheet risk and homes in inventory present lower risk since they turn into cash in a short period of time, we plan to exclude inventory homes from the calculations on a go forward basis. It's just a better way to look at our business and will provide greater comparability to others in our industry. So, for reference, we had approximately 40,000 homes in inventory, mostly under construction at November 30th. If we exclude those homes from the calculations, our years owned was 1.9 years and home sites controlled was 69%. We also remained committed to our focus on increasing shareholder returns. During the fiscal year we repurchased 11 million shares totaling 967 million or about 4% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Additionally, during the year, we returned cash to our shareholders by paying dividends of $438 million. From a leverage perspective as we mentioned, we continue to benefit from our paydown of senior notes and strong generation of earnings, which brought our homebuilding debt to total capital down to 14.4 at quarter-end, our lowest ever, which was an improvement from 18.3 in the prior year. And as we mentioned, our net debt to total capital at quarter-end was a negative 2.4%. As we look forward, we do not have any senior note maturities in fiscal ‘23. Our next maturity is $400 million due in December of ‘23, which is our fiscal ‘24. And just a few finer points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders’ equity increased to $24 billion. Our book value per share increased to $83.16. Our return on inventory was 32.8% and our return on equity was 20.9%. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provides us with significant financial flexibility for the upcoming year. And with that brief overview, let me turn now to the first quarter of ‘23. It continues to be difficult to provide the targeted guidance that we have historically provided, given the uncertainty of market conditions. So, as we did last quarter, we're providing very broad ranges to give some boundaries for each of the components of our first quarter. So, starting with new orders, we expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 12,000 to 13,500 homes and expect our Q1 ending community count to be about flattish with the prior year as we walked away from deals that would have produced new active communities. We anticipate Q1 deliveries to also be in the range of 12,000 to 13,500 homes. Our Q1 average sales price should be in the range of 440,000 to 450,000 as we continue to price to market. We expect gross margins to be about 21%. This number will adjust somewhat based on the number of deliveries, primarily as a result of our policy to expense field costs. As Stuart mentioned, as we see things today, we expect our Q1 gross margin will be the low point for gross margins for the year. And we expect SG&A to be about 8%. This too will adjust based on deliveries and homebuilding revenue. For the combined homebuilding joint venture and land sale and other categories, we expect to have a loss of about $10 million. And looking at our other business segments, we anticipate our Financial Services -- earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. We expect a loss of about $25 million for our multifamily business and for the Lennar Other category also a loss of about $25 million. This guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments, since that adjustment will be determined by the stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A percentage to be about 2.0% to 2.2%, as a result of lower total revenues and our continuing investment in internal technology initiatives to produce efficiencies. Our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. The weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 287 million shares. So, when you pull this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of approximately a $1.40 to a $1.70 per share for the first quarter. Finally, given the market uncertainty, we're providing boundaries for deliveries only for the full year of 60,000 to 65,000, but are not providing further details at the time. However, we do look forward to giving another update on our next earnings call. So, with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate all the information, very exciting times here. I thought that the most interesting thing you commented on today was your outlook for gross margins in 1Q to be the low point for the year. And so I wanted to explore that a little bit. I think you -- there were a few components. I think you talked about lower costs that would start flowing through -- I think you said in the back half of 2Q and mostly into the back half of the year. You also mentioned, I think, Jon, that lumber benefit is already in the numbers for 1Q. So, that's probably not the reason. So, there's two other potential reasons I could see why margins might improve. One of them is that maybe you're benefiting from having lower the level of specifications or finishes, finish level of the homes, and so its cost in U.S. Maybe -- and those would be delivered in Q2? Or that maybe you've seen an improvement in buyer demand over the past several weeks. And so, I was wanting to see if you could comment on either of those. And also tell us what range of mortgage rate are you assuming in your outlook?
Jon Jaffe: So, that's a lot of questions, Steve. So, let me start by saying we do expect that our first quarter margin, we think, is going to be a low point. I think it derives in large part from a very general notion, and that is we've gotten out ahead of the migration downward in pricing. We've done it by price reduction and by incentive structure, as noted. And we took a very strong first move in that regard in order to keep the machine, the volume moving in the right direction. With that in mind, we started the reconciliation process with land. Remember, our land position is much shorter term than it's been in past. And therefore, we have flexibility. And so, we think that we'll be able to reconcile some land pricing. And as far as our trade partners are concerned, I think I was clear, we've been working with trade partners, both on labor and material. Some of those materials like lumber are already filtering through, just at the very early stages filtering through some of the price reductions that will build as we go through the year. But we are working hand in hand with our partners. And given our volume and pickup in market share, there's a lot of labor, a lot of other people out there that are looking to do business with us. We think we'll be able to bring our pricing down. And additionally, we've been hard at work, reconciling efficiencies in the homes that we built, changing product where appropriate and making sure that we are best positioned at sales prices, at interest rates that are higher to be able to access the market and refine our margin as we go through the year. You asked a question as what our assumption is relative to interest rates. We've kept a flexibility in our numbers. We recognize that the Fed is focused on unemployment numbers and wage numbers and are likely to continue raising interest rates. But the tenure has had a mind of its own, and mortgage rates have been trending down. I noted the flexibility, the shock absorber nature of our program, our dynamic pricing program that we have in place. All of it is almost agnostic to interest rates. We're going to keep moving through the year, adjusting our pricing and the affordability for our customers in order to do what we can to maintain volume. So, we don't have a forward view on interest rates that defines how our program is working, we're going to be adaptable to the interest rate as it evolves through the year. All indications though are that we're probably not going to see much more spiking and more moderating relative to interest rates. But that's a toss-up question.
Rick Beckwitt: I guess the only thing I think I would add to that is very thorough -- is that -- our gross margin is impacted by the volume of closings that we have at every quarter. And Q1 is most likely going to be the lower volume quarter. And as we close more homes, as Diane said in her description, the level field overhead that gets absorbed is spread over more closing, so that has a positive impact on margins.
Stuart Miller: And I know Jon wants to add something. Go ahead, J.
Jon Jaffe: I just want to clarify, Steve, on what I said about construction costs. As I noted, we're currently working closely with our trade and adjusting contracted pricing. That's what I was referencing in terms of will start flowing through in the second half of the second quarter. The biggest needle mover is lumber, which moved down throughout the year, and we will see a benefit of that throughout the entire second quarter.
Stephen Kim: Gotcha. Okay. That is helpful, Jon. So, in other words, you're not talking about deliveries in the back half of 2Q with that lower contracted pricing. That's going to be on stuff you're sort of starting in the back half of 2Q, I guess.
Jon Jaffe: No, starting now and through quarter and even on some open commitments on homes already started. It's just that we'll see the first benefits of those renegotiated prices with trade starting to happen in the latter part of the second quarter, and we will see the full -- the benefit throughout the full quarter of lumber reductions that started happening in the summer of '22.
Stephen Kim: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. Second question is on your owned lot count. I know you talked a lot about the ratio in years and all that. But your actual number of owned lots declined for the third straight quarter, and it's down almost 20% from 1Q. And so, I'm wondering, can you help us anticipate how much the actual owned lot count might fall over the next few quarters if market conditions stay challenging and conversely, what kind of market conditions would you need to see for your owned lot count to start rising again?
Rick Beckwitt: Diane, do you want to start that one off?
Diane Bessette: Yes. I mean, Steve, the way I look at it, I think that it's a positive direction that our owned -- home site count has been going down. The desire is to always protect the balance sheet and reduce risk. So, the growth really comes from controlling as much as we can and keeping our owned at a much lower level. But the owned home sites really should be primarily finished home sites where we're going to put a shovel on the ground pretty quickly. So, I'm not bothered by the reduction of owned. The goal is to keep that as low as possible and keep growing the controlled percentage.
Rick Beckwitt: Well, and I think that basically, if you think about what we're doing strategically, really building the pipeline between our land bankers, our land bank programming and the execution strategy embedded in our volume-based programming. And that's just going to continue to build confidence. I think that you'll see our owned home site count continued to moderate and be right sized relative to the business to be able to adequately provide for either stable delivery levels or growth levels as we choose. But that confidence that we're building and that pipeline I think is really value-add for the future.
Stephen Kim: Great. Yes, I didn't mean to imply that. I thought that that was a bad thing, Diane. I certainly agree with you. It's a good thing.
Rick Beckwitt: Very good. It's good, and it's getting better.
Diane Bessette: Yes.
Operator: Next, we'll go to Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari: My first question is thinking about the sales pace, would you actually maintain ahead of your historical normal level in the last quarter, despite everything that's going on, on the ground. And assuming that that does kind of tie to this broader strategy that you have around, inventory controls and cash generation, can you talk to how we should be thinking about the sales pace for next year? The ability to hold it perhaps elevated even as we do continue to move through this environment and what that will mean for the level of cash that you can generate in 2023?
Rick Beckwitt: So, looking at our sales pace for last quarter as well as our go-forward sales pace, we're going to keep -- as Stuart said, we're going to keep the machine going and feel that from an overhead and operational standpoint we get greater leverage by keeping that sales active. We know it's above where we were in 2019 from a pace standpoint and our focus is to keep and maintain that pace as we move forward into 2023.
Stuart Miller: I think you can expect a lot of consistency. I probably haven't spent enough time talking about our dynamic pricing model, but it is really at the core of how we're running our business, and we're doing it on a day-by-day basis, focusing on how do we get the right pricing for the customer base for today's affordability to maintain that sales pace. I think you're going to continue to see us working hard in that direction. As I noted, it has the ancillary business of informing our land banking pipeline, but the dependability they expected is the dependability they'll get. And we're moving through our pipeline of higher-priced land that was priced or bought to yesterday's pricing, and we'll be bringing in land that is more appropriately priced to current market conditions. All of this kind of works synergistically to really inform us to keep that volume and that sales pace consistent.
Jon Jaffe: I would just add and remind you that our strategy has been and remains matching sales to our start pace, and we have a very steady start pace that will inform our sales pace as we move forward. That ties directly into the dynamic pricing model that as a tool our operators use to do exactly that.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's all very helpful. And I guess it also leads to the next question of how do you think about the uses of that cash. You mentioned that you're obviously in a net cash position now as it relates to your balance sheet. What are some of the priorities? You bought back stock in this past quarter. Would you consider getting more aggressive there, or anything else that's on your radar?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So, I'm happy you asked that question. I know it's on the minds of many of our investors and people that follow the Company. We're not ashamed of having too much cash. In fact, in these -- in times like we've been in, it's a tremendous advantage and produces a lot of optionality. Looking backwards to this quarter, this was a tough reconciling quarter. Again, you have the clash of prices coming down in a very complicated supply chain that was in this repair, exacerbated by two hurricanes rolling through our primary markets. This was a very good quarter to focus on our balance sheet and cash generation. But here we sit in what we do with cash, we're likely to continue to generate cash with the program that's in place. Stock buybacks are clearly one of those avenues. We're constantly looking opportunistically at repurchasing stock. We did purchase some stock this quarter. But in the abundance of caution, we just decided to go slow before we go fast. Stock buybacks are on the table. But, also as we come around, we know -- and remember that in the body of my messages, we are going to sit with a production reduction, I think, it's going to be by a third, maybe more, a reduction in production of homes, both multifamily and single-family. We are not going to see the existing home market, putting a lot of supply in place because buyers are protecting low interest rates. And we're not going to have an inventory overhang. So, it is our belief that the duration of this correction is going to be somewhat smaller or more limited. And having additional capital enables us to be opportunistic in growing our business when those signals start to come our way as well. And you know us from the past. People have seen how we operate in the past. Lennar tends to be a first mover; we probably will be in this case as well. So, book to grow our business and to buy back stock and to pay down debt, all of these are viable uses of cash. We're fortunate to have the optionality to go slow first and then to accelerate and to pick and choose where the best returns are garnered.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Ken Zener: Stuart, an iconic movie says, ABC, always be closing, which requires you to start homes to optimize inventory turns, which reduces your land, your most cyclical asset. A simple strategy as many investors overlook when considering margins alone. My first question is, with starts leading orders, could you comment on how you balance the unit economics of, let's say, the lower margin, 5% versus the incremental cash flow of selling that unit as your land goes down 20% or perhaps 50% when your actual inventory units decline because I think the idea is the income statement is nice, but the cash flow that comes from these choices is much more cyclically important.
Stuart Miller: Well, in your question, you basically embedded the entirety of our strategy because the reality is if you look backwards, we have been reducing our SG&A to extremely low levels so that as margins come down, we're still producing cash and we're producing profit and bottom line. But at the same time, it enables us in tougher time to continue turning our inventory, turning our land inventory, as I noted, our higher price purchased to yesterday's pricing land inventory. We will continue turning that. It is cash productive and we'll redeploy that into repriced land purchases for the future. All of this is symbiotic and works to drive cash flows, replenish inventory appropriately positioned while keeping the trains running on time and generating cash flow, improving the balance sheet and maintaining profitability. So, that is basically the game plan.
Ken Zener: Great. And then second question, Diane, I think your comments on owned land, 2.5 years versus 1.9 [ph] absent WIP is new. Within that context, my question is if you do 12,500 starts at 50,000 annualized, just to make it simple, does that suggest or imply your ending inventory units will probably be down versus -- year-over-year versus your 60,000 closing because that's going to be potentially an enormous amount of cash flow from that unit reduction? Thank you.
Diane Bessette: Yes. I think that's right, Ken. I mean, as you've heard us say consistently, we're very focused on keeping volume up, capturing our market share. We're enthusiastic about resolving some of the supply chain issues. You heard Stuart mention that we think embedded in our balance sheet might be about $1.5 billion. So, whether that's the exact right number or not is we can debate. But directionally, the point is there's a lot of cash sitting on our balance sheet. And so, as we unwind all of that, that would lead me to believe that you'll see lower inventory level and low home and construction -- construction.
Stuart Miller: And by the way, it reminds me of a meeting that we had with one of our investors some years ago, where we mapped out -- and when I say some, I’m talking about like 6 or 7 or 8 years ago, where we mapped out exactly the strategy. You remember that, Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes.
Stuart Miller: We mapped out exactly the strategy and said, this is what we're going to do, all the way down to the reduction in that inventory level, and this is exactly the game plan.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Matthew Bouley: So, I just wanted to ask about sort of the, I guess, the downside scenarios. The balance between price, margins and pace, clearly, your price taker model is successfully keeping that sales pace elevated and you're getting the cash generation out of that. And I know you mentioned the 21% gross margin is going to be -- or potentially the low point for the year. But my question is if market conditions were to deteriorate, kind of where the limit is to your willingness to trade margin further? Is there somewhere where you would draw the line? Basically, how does the model kind of change when you get to these levels on gross margin? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Well, let me just say that as I noted just a minute ago, we've been preparing for this for quite a long time. We have been focused on building efficiencies, sticky efficiencies into our SG&A, especially at the division level over the past years, quarter-by-quarter, basis points by basis points, we have been refining, reducing the cost of doing business. I think that if market conditions were to continue to deteriorate, we're going to continue to lean into the consistent program going forward. We have a lot of room to be able to make those adjustments. I think that there's been some concern about notions of impairment. There might be some modest impairments that flow through with further deterioration, but it's not going to be the significant kind of programming that you've seen in the past. I think we've got really terrific shock absorbers within our operating platform to be able to continue the program even as -- even if you look at a downside scenario, we'll continue to be building and volume focused through alterations of the market.
Rick Beckwitt: And you really can't underestimate the leverage that we get in working with our trade partners as things slow down across the board. People are looking for work. If we're going to be the ones out there to do -- starting homes, we're going to get cost concessions, bringing cost concessions from our trade partners, from our land partners, and we're just going to continue, as Jon said, value engineer and re-specify product in order to make it more affordable, so we can have more higher margins.
Matthew Bouley: And second one, Stuart, you just alluded to it, but I wanted to ask about the impairment side. You did take the small write-downs in the quarter. It sounds like you're -- as you just mentioned, that you might expect some smaller ones going forward. But just kind of I guess, number one, given what you did write down this quarter, did that kind of clear the deck, so to speak, or as you think about potential market deterioration, what would be that kind of next decile of communities where there is risk? Just kind of any elaboration on owned land impairments and then further option walkaways?
Stuart Miller: Okay. Look, I understand the concern and the black box of impairments that naturally people feel. If you look historically, we've been very quick to get ahead of the curve. And so, when you ask the question, did we clear the decks, we're always clearing the decks and that's how we think about it. The answer is as if the market is going to continue to deteriorate, and we can't put a boundary on what that might mean. We're going to always be straightforward and give as much visibility as possible. And I don't think there's additional visibility to give right now. I think that the size and scale of what we took as an impairment is about all there is. We really -- especially given cash and balance sheet and everything else, we really shook the tree this time and -- as we always do, and the -- cleared the decks, as you say. I think you're going to consistently see that with Lennar. It's always been the case with Lennar. Diane, do you want to add to it?
Diane Bessette: Yes. I was going to say, Matt, if you think about what you're looking for an impairment, it's where you're finding negative net margins. And so if you look at where our gross margins are, it's not a surprise that our impairment split between backlog and active communities. On the active communities side, it was 8 communities, and we have 1,200. So, there's always going to be some communities that have negative net margins. But given where we are as a company on average, I don't think that the concern for net margin should be as great as some people are articulating. There's always going to be some backlog adjustments. There's always going to be some communities that are below the norm, but I don't think we're anywhere near the widespread impairments that people are voicing concern over.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research.
Truman Patterson: Diane, congratulations on the cash balance. So first question is kind of three part with your dynamic pricing model. One, could you just elaborate on it a bit more with perhaps not giving away too much competitively, if you will. But second, I understand every market is different, but could you just discuss generally what level of pricing maybe below nearby competing communities is generally needed to move the inventory. And then three, you all, Stuart, I believe, said that incentives kind of accelerated through the quarter, discounts. Any way in orders, you could just kind of give us an understanding where you sat in November, December versus maybe a year ago?
Stuart Miller: So, was the first part that he was asking about the pricing model?
Diane Bessette: Dynamic, yes.
Truman Patterson: Yes, yes, the dynamic pricing.
Diane Bessette: And the one of the questions...
Stuart Miller: To be able to understand and really get into the pricing model, you'd have to talk to the inimitable Jeff Moses, and he doesn't talk to anyone. Keep it internally. But, do you want to go ahead and answer that, Diane?
Diane Bessette: It's really an incredible tool, Truman, and we really should spend -- and I'm happy to do that, I'm really happy to spend some time. It's much more involved than you would imagine. It's a home-by-home assessment, each home, each community, each market, and the tool looks -- of what we've sold that exact plan for over time. And it also looks at the market competition for that plan in that community in that market. So, it's a lot of detail, but the point is it truly gives us an unbelievable amount of real-time detailed information because that's really the only way that you can price. We talk about it at a very high level, but pricing really is at a planned community market level. And it allows us to be really flexible when pricing is going up as well as pricing is going down. We use the tool in all market conditions.
Stuart Miller: And it is real-time available to the local market as well as to the corporate office and everyone in between. And so that connected engagement really enables us to stay close to the market, close to the pricing and very interactive at all levels of the company.
Diane Bessette: And react quickly. Yes.
Jon Jaffe: The other thing that tool does, you hear us throughout our strategies, talk about start pace and sales pace. This tool connects all of the dynamics and metrics Diane just referenced to that pace, so we can adjust in real time to make sure that we're not ever getting behind the pace that we want to be at.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then any -- I'm just trying to understand maybe the elasticity of demand with how much might be needed to move relative to some competitors nearby?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, as we said in the commentary, we're constantly evaluating what's going on with other competitors, what their inventory position is, what their pricing is, are they generating sales? And this is a very fluid conversation that Jon and I have with the regional presidents and the division presidents. We are all over this. And to the extent someone make a pricing adjustment and if we need to move something, we're going to move it. We want to stay ahead of it and hopefully have them follow what we do. And there's not anything that we're really not familiar with that's going on out there.
Stuart Miller: And it dovetails -- all of this dovetails with our digital marketing focus. We have a robust digital marketing group with data science component that dovetails exactly with the dynamic pricing program. So, we're generating -- we're generating the customer base and building the pricing that is going to appeal and creating the intersection.
Rick Beckwitt: And I think that the drop to mic or the proof in the pudding is, and Stuart mentioned that we've only got 900 completed homes in the Company right now. And in many ways, I would tell Jon, I’d like some more. Jon said he'd like less. We have our even flow and machine going and homes are being produced as we match them to sales, we've got the perfect amount of inventory.
Stuart Miller: Yes. And I'm going to say as long as you brought it up, we have 900 homes in inventory. We would actually be better with more of that standing inventory because of today's customer is...
Diane Bessette: Premium.
Stuart Miller: Yes, it’s premium. And I'd want to emphasize one more time there were no bulk sales at discounted rates to clear inventory. And you don’t always trust what you read. So, let's go from there.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. And then just on the vendor and contractor savings specifically, what inning of cost savings do you think we're in today? And as of, we'll call it, December 15th, are the savings primarily on the labor side, or are there certain materials, products, outside of lumber?
Jon Jaffe: Look, we're clearly in the early innings because as the homebuilding industry is completing the fourth quarter of the year, you have for all builders really the largest production quarter, so labor has been -- has remained very busy while the market has slowed down prior to the fourth quarter. And as Stuart noted and I noted, it's -- that's why you typically always see a lag between sales prices moving down and then construction costs moving down. So, we're clearly in the early innings of that. We feel like we've got tremendous traction. And as I noted earlier, I think we'll see significant movement as we move through our first quarter, into our second quarter in terms of reductions. And that will happen primarily because starts have dramatically slowed within the industry. We've kept our start level at a consistent pace. And so as that labor frees up, that brings the cost of labor down. But also as the starts come down, that creates more availability of materials for the manufacturing production. So, material prices come down as well. That also tends to lag a little bit more behind labor because it's got a longer production cycle where labor is more immediate.
Operator: Our next question is from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Stuart, I'd love to drill in a little bit on your kind of industry-wide starts outlook for next year. My initial reaction when you kind of threw out down 30% was a little bit of a surprise. And I guess the way I'm thinking about it is, you guys are targeting a pretty flat pace for the year. Your largest competitor D.R. Horton has kind of articulated something similar. You guys are 25% of the single-family production market. There's been a lot of other builders that pulled back very sharply this year on starts as they were kind of clearing through some of the spec they built up in the spring. But if you have said we see the advantages of spec. We're going to ramp our start pace heading into the spring to kind of capitalize on that as well. So, I guess, my question is, how do you kind of arrive at that number? And let's say, for argument's sake, the decline is less than that, let's say, 10% or 20%. Does that impact your confidence on kind of getting the cost savings that you're clearly expecting for the year and the margin guidance that you gave as far as 1Q being the low watermark?
Stuart Miller: So first of all, Alan, I'd say that we could look at some of the larger builders, and I'm sure that they'll adjust their start pace and no one has fleeted the switch in industry, a lot of very smart participants. But there are some practical realities relative to smaller builders across the country. Remember, the larger builders are that we make a proportion. And the capital markets are complicated right now. It's not just a question of strategy for some. It's a question of what can you actually get started and how are the capital markets supporting it. I think that it might be only 10% or 20% or 30%. I don't know what the percentage is going to be. My personal view is that it looks like many of the smaller builders are really pulled back, the complication of price reductions and what's been paid for land and stuff like that. The other side of it, which makes up about a third of production is multifamily. And the multifamily capital markets are very frozen up right now. I think that the number of new communities coming out of the ground for multifamily and even the single-family for rent buyers are kind of seized up because of capital markets considerations. So, let's not even throw in strategy just from a capital market standpoint, it feels to me, can't prove that, a very sizable portion of starts for next year are going to be under limitation. Now, if it ends up being only 10% instead of 25%, still, you're looking at a housing shortage. I know that there are many with different opinions on this. I believe there's been a production shortage, housing shortage across the country. If you talk to mayors and governors across the country, their single biggest concern is workforce housing supply and affordability. It is a drumbeat that is in almost every major city and every state. And we feel that there is a shortage that is going to be compounded by the fact that there will be some production and reduction out of this and whether 10% or 35%, it's still going to be short supply, and I think a more limited downturn.
Alan Ratner: I appreciate the insight there, Stuart. Secondly, I think you kind of touched on it a little bit. You highlighted your can rate peaking in October, but just to kind of be more explicit. Can you just talk about what changes you have seen over the last 3, 4 weeks with the pullback in rates? Have you seen home buyer demand improving? And any pricing power coming back even or maybe a moderation in the need for additional incentives thus far in November and early December so far?
Stuart Miller: So, we've seen a combination of increased traffic, greater buyer demand, traffic increase, both on -- in the community level and on our website, definitely fewer cams, [ph] which we noted. And all of that has just been stabilizing the environment, hasn’t quite led to higher pricing yet, but those are generally happened before you gain some sort of pricing power accounts.
Alan Ratner: And just to be clear, that is incorporated in your 1Q order guidance of down 15% to I think 25 or so percent that incorporates...
Stuart Miller: Yes. That's the range that we're expecting at this point in time.
Operator: Our final question comes from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Rehaut: First question, just wanted to be clear. I am sorry if I'm not fully grasping elements of the guidance or comments. But on your view around or outlook around first quarter gross margins being the lowest of the year and improving from there on in. Just wanted to be clear that -- or perhaps you could articulate a little bit what type of view on price or pricing trends over the next 6 to 9 months does that incorporate? Because certainly, it appears that it's incorporating some amount of cost relief, I guess, as you're going into the back half. I'd be curious how much of a basis point standpoint the cost relief is. But more importantly, what type of view on price does that outlook for gross margins throughout fiscal '23 reflect?
Rick Beckwitt: So from a price ASP standpoint, we're not assuming any appreciation in the market. That's what our underwriting is at. That's what we see out there. To the extent that there's price appreciation or we're able to increase our ASP, what we do with incentives and there's a benefit in the financing market, that's just incremental upside to what we view will happen in 2023.
Jon Jaffe: Just to emphasize Rick's point, Michael, if you think about mortgage rate buydowns is really being a very effective tool in making sales in this environment. To the extent that rates come in, the cost of that buy down becomes less expensive and you could see probably potentially the biggest benefit from that if that come in.
Mike Rehaut: So just to be clear then, you're not baking in, obviously, any price appreciation. But on the flip side, you're not baking in any further softening in pricing trends from here on in as well in terms of additional incentives or price discounts needed if the market continues to slip from here?
Rick Beckwitt: That's correct. So, we're assuming no price appreciation, no incremental price reductions. We think that the incentives that we've been offering are good, solid incentives and base prices in order to attract the volume. I think you can see that in the numbers that we've been generating. The margin upside throughout the year as we noted Q1 is going to be the low point. It’s really going to come from several things. One, Jon went through the cost side, Jon went through the cycle time, Stuart talked about land and we're going to continue to value engineer product to the extent that we need to.
Stuart Miller: And to the extent that prices curtail a bit more, some of the embedded cost savings are going to be offsets to that. But I think that we've gotten ahead of where prices have been going. And so, we're looking at kind of a level field right now.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. No, I appreciate that. And I guess just secondly, any thoughts around community count growth as the year progresses? I know obviously, there's been movement on the lot side and walking away from different amounts of lots on the option side. But oftentimes that might impact one or two years out. So, any thoughts around where the community count might be by year-end '23 versus '22?
Stuart Miller: So we rather not talk about community count right now because it's a very moving picture. You might expect since we’ve renegotiated, repositioned deals that community count could or should grow in the back half of '23. But I think right now, it's just too soon to give any guidance as to what those numbers would be.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you, Mike, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I know that we went on a little longer than normal, but these are complicated times. It's been a complicated year-end and we wanted to give a lot of detail. Look forward to reporting back in our first quarter. And if you have further questions, give us a call. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This morning, I'm here in Miami joined by Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from; Jon Jaffe and Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEOs and Co-Presidents are on the line also, but they will be participating remotely for the Q&A. As usual, I'm going to give a macro overview and strategic Lennar plan. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about our markets around the country. Jon will update on supply chain, construction costs, land strategy, and as usual Diane will give a detailed financial highlight and will give some rough boundaries for the fourth quarter to assist in go-forward thinking and modeling. And then, we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit to one question, one follow-up. So, let me begin and start by saying that once again, the Lennar team has turned in an excellent third quarter result, which continues to enhance our positioning for the evolving market conditions. Throughout our third quarter, we continued to manage the still constrained supply chain and workforce and delivered over 17,200 homes with a gross margin of 29.2%, and the net margin of 23.5%. These deliveries continued to drive very strong cash flow and bottom-line earnings as we continue to refine our already efficient operation with SG&A of 5.8% for a 120 basis-point improvement over last year. With strong bottom-line earnings of $1.47 billion or $5.03 per diluted share, driving strong cash flow, we've continued to fortify our balance sheet. After paying down $575 million of maturing senior debt without replacement, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash, nothing drawn on our revolver and a 15% debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to 21.2% last year. As a matter of careful capital allocation this quarter, given current market conditions, we chose not to repurchase stock in favor of early retirement of debt. As we continue to drive strong closings and performance, we are well-prepared to handle the current market conditions. In addition to the well-documented supply chain constraints and limited workforce slowing production, housing has now been considerably impacted by the more than doubling of mortgage rates over the past months and therefore, the doubling of monthly payment costs and reduction of housing affordability. The housing market has continued to weaken, as expected, in response to the Fed’s too late, but now very rapid and aggressive reaction to inflation. Home building finds itself, once again at the forefront of all that is happening in the economy, and the Fed's use of its interest rate tool to curtail inflation is certainly having the desired effect on the for-sale housing market. The market is now adjusting. The interest rate movements were very sudden and adjusted very quickly, and that suddenness has always led to a pullback in housing demand. Part of the pullback is driven by simple affordability, and part of the pullback is driven by the psychology of the sudden and aggressive interest rate hike, causing either monthly payment sticker shock or a sense of having missed the boat. The Fed chair's additional increase of 75 basis points of the Fed funds rate yesterday together with an articulated determination to do more, suggests that even more challenges lie ahead. While demand has cooled at once high pricing levels, demand for shelter still exists, where price intersects with current interest rates to produce an affordable monthly payment. There is still a housing shortage across the country, especially workforce housing and household formation has continued to rise. There's still very limited inventory and there's very little exposure to traditional inventory overhangs like foreclosures and speculators. Additionally, buyers are still seeking shelter from inflationary pressures on rentals as scarce rentals and increased demand from those who would otherwise purchase, drive and keep rents higher. As we bring prices down and incentives up, demand is still there. And these fundamentals give us assurance that while there is short and medium term reconciliation, the long term prospects for housing continue to be strong. Demand remains reasonably strong at adjusted prices as buyers still have jobs as well as down-payments and have attractive credit scores and can qualify. With higher rates, prices must be adjusted downward and incentives used to find the market or sales just drop off. Accordingly, we have carefully managed sales price and our pace through the third quarter, exactly as we said we would last quarter. Although our sales are down 12% from last year's levels, we have focused our management's attention on finding pricing levels that attract demand. Each market is different, and as much as it is an art and not a science, our efforts have slightly lagged our goal of matching our sales pace with our start pace, but we feel certain that we will find pricing and accelerate that pace in the near future. In a few minutes, Rick is going to give a more detailed overall market review that will give a more comprehensive snapshot of what we've seen in our markets across the country. Along with bringing home sales price down, we are also laser focused on bringing down production costs as well. We are working with our vast network of trade partners to recognize that the world has changed and we all have to work together to keep the machine working. In fact, last night I returned from a two-day extraordinary supply chain conference that was hosted by our purchasing leadership group led by Kemp Gillis, trade partners and Lennar division leaders convened to work together to attack costs, find efficiencies and adjust to current market conditions. Rick and Jon will drive continued and focused attention on this critical initiative. And as the market recalibrates, land costs will have to adjust as well. Accordingly, we are reviewing and re-underwriting every land deal in our pipeline to the current market conditions. In time, new land deals will have different pricing that will be properly sized to the home sales prices. Overall, these are the trends as we see them. And while we can choose to fight against the trends, the reality is that the market has been changing and we are getting ahead of it by making all necessary adjustments. Last quarter, we laid out our simple strategy playbook going forward. Let me review and add a few items. We're going to keep it simple and focused and here to this core strategy. First, as I said, last quarter, we're going to continue to sell homes, adjust pricing to market conditions, and maintain reasonable volume. We have discussed over the past years that we have a strong -- that we have a housing shortage across the country. We will continue to build even as prices adjust in order to fill that shortfall and provide much needed workforce housing. As we have noted many times in the past, whether the market is improving or declining, we employ our dynamic pricing model week-by-week to price product to current market conditions in order to maximize pricing and margin while we maintain a very carefully and limited inventory level. As the market moves, that is how we will continue to be responsive. Second, we are going to work with our trade partners, as I've said, to right-size our cost structure to current market conditions as well. Third, we will and have sharpened our attention on land acquisitions. We are being extremely selective on new land acquisitions and new communities. We have re-reviewed and re-underwritten every land deal in our pipeline, and we are re-underwriting to current market conditions. Capital allocation is being micromanaged as every dollar invested in land must compete against repurchasing our own stock as we seek to maximize total shareholder value and return. In sync with selling homes, we will continue to improve our cost of doing business by focusing on and reducing SG&A. We have seen quarter-over-quarter improvement in our SG&A over the past years, and we expect to drive efficiencies through technology and process improvement to offset market adjustments where possible while we leverage our extraordinary management team across the country. Next, we will maintain tight inventory control. We are aware that our inventory levels are up 20% year-over-year. This increase is mostly a function of growth, supply chain dysfunction, and expanded cycle time. As our growth rate is reduced to zero and our cycle times revert to normal, our inventory should shrink and should generate sizable cash flow in the future. Our commitment to sales pace will ensure that we will not create standing inventory in its place. Next, we'll continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line to protect and enhance our already extraordinary balance sheet. And finally, we will conclude our long-planned and awaited spin-off by year-end. Recent back-and-forth questions with the SEC could push the final date by a month or so, but Quarterra will be listed very soon. Of course, prior to the spin, we will have a comprehensive company overview and conference call to introduce the new management team and to further detail the financial elements of the company. Stay tuned. As we have continued to refine and finalize the three verticals of our spin company, we will spin a mature asset management company into the public market along with billions of dollars of assets under management that we previously held on Lennar's books. Lennar will be a pure-play homebuilding company with a simple mandate to build and sell homes that delight our customers while we drive and maximize shareholder value. The final spin of our new company, Quarterra, will trade under the stock symbol Q, and will have -- as noted before, will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. We are very excited about the prospects for Quarterra as this is our second spin in our history, and we have great confidence for its prospects for the future. So, let me conclude by saying that while the market is shifting and adjusting to a new higher interest rate environment, we at Lennar are prepared. We have been here before, and we have navigated adversity. We have a seasoned team that knows exactly what to do and how to do it. Every member of the Lennar management team is fully aligned and working in a coordinated way. We are extremely well positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and to succeed in these conditions. We recognize that interest rates are rising, inflation continues to be a legitimate threat and important parts of the economy are slowing. We know that the Fed is determined to curtail inflation, and this will take some time. But we also know how to adjust to the market -- to these market changes, and we are making those adjustments. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we recognize there are challenges in the market that we must carefully regard, expect that we will meet the challenges and that we will continue to adjust to maximize opportunity and drive Lennar into an ever better future. With that, let me turn over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the overall housing market has been reacting to significant increases in mortgage rates, continued inflation and a volatile stock market, all of which has impacted affordability and homebuyer confidence. While we continue to have some strong markets, in our more challenging areas, we've had to adjust prices and increase incentives to regain sales momentum. Our sales strategy has been to find the market clearing price for each of our homes on a community-by-community basis as quickly as possible and price our homes accordingly. This has required a detailed understanding of traffic trends, inventory levels, community and product-specific pricing, financing programs and buyer sentiment. During the third quarter, our new sales orders declined by 12% from the prior year on a 1% lower year-over-year community count. While our cancellation rate and sales incentives picked up during the quarter, our sales orders and sales pace per community increased sequentially each month as we successfully executed our pricing strategy in more and more markets. To put some color on this, our sales pace per community in June, July and August was 3.7, 3.9 and 4.5, respectively [Technical Difficulty] for the quarter. To achieve this, we lowered our base new order sales price and increased sales incentives in many communities. On a company-wide basis, new sales order incentives increased during the quarter from 2.3% in June to 6% in August and varied significantly by market and community. Based on these combined adjustments, our new net order sales price declined 9% sequentially from the second quarter but was up 1% from the prior year. This pricing strategy produced enough new gross sales to offset cancellations company-wide as our third quarter cancellation rate was 21%, which is slightly above our historical average. Our pricing strategy has continued to work successfully in September. It gives us confidence in our new sales orders guidance for the fourth quarter. We fundamentally believe that this price to market strategy reflects our balance sheet first focus, where we can maintain starts in sales, generate cash flow and keep our homebuilding machine going. I'd now like to give you an update on our markets across the country. They really fall into three categories: one, markets that have continued to perform well; two, markets where we have adjusted pricing and incentives, found the market price and have successfully regained sales momentum; and three, markets that may require some additional pricing adjustments to regain our targeted absorption base. During the third quarter and so far in September, we have had 9 markets that continue to perform well. These are Southwest Florida, Southeast Florida, Palm Atlantic, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Charlotte, Indianapolis and San Diego. These markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory and many are benefiting from a strong local economy, employment growth and in-migration. While these markets have continued to be strong, we have had to offer mortgage buydown programs and normalized incentives to maintain sales momentum. Some communities in these markets have required targeted price adjustments on a limited basis. Our category two markets, which reflect markets where we have made more significant adjustments to regain sales momentum, include 22 markets. These are Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, Coastal Carolinas, Atlanta, Chicago and Nashville, Raleigh, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, Colorado, Coastal California, Coastal Carolinas, Inland Empire, Bay Area, the Central Valley, Sacramento, Seattle and Portland. Each of these markets’ traffic has slowed, and we saw a pickup in cancellations. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we've had to offer more aggressive financing programs, base price reductions and/or increased incentives to regain sales momentum. Size of the adjustments has varied on a community-by-community basis and has often been limited to specific homes each week -- in each community each week. In some cases, to avoid cancellations, we have adjusted pricing on our homes in backlog. We believe we are being very proactive with our pricing and not reactive. This has allowed us to sell homes and avoid building finished inventory. We are outselling the competition and are increasing our market share. Category 3 markets, which reflect more significant market softening and correction, include 7 markets. These are the Philly Metro area, Minnesota, Pensacola, Austin, Reno, Boise and Utah. While the drivers and individual dynamics of these markets are varied somewhat, traffic has slowed significantly, buyers are taking more time to make a purchase decision, and many need to be convinced that now is the time to buy. There is fear that sales prices have not hit bottom, which has led to an elevated level of cancellations. In these markets, we are focused on establishing pricing that generates new gross sales to offset cancellations. This has required us to work in many cases with backlog to prevent cancellations. It has also required a mix of significant base price adjustments, sales incentives and aggressive mortgage buydowns. While we've made progress in these markets, we still need to make some adjustments on a community-by-community basis. There's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Everything needs to be fine-tuned to the specifics of the market and community. I'm confident that we'll make progress in each of these markets in the fourth quarter. We're fortunate to have solid gross margins and limited completed unsold inventory, so we should be able to get these markets on track shortly. I hope this gives you a better picture of our markets across the country and what we're doing to keep our sales activity going. Markets remain very fluid, and we are making proactive strategic decisions and adjustments every day. We are committed as a management team to address any future market changes quickly. As we've said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine going, maintain our starts pace and price our homes to market. This is our balance sheet focus. Before I turn it over to Jon, I'd like to thank all of our trade partners and associates for their hard work and endless dedication during these rapidly changing times to successfully execute our operating strategies. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. This morning, I will discuss our sales and inventory management focus, our land strategy, and give an update on the status of the supply chain. I'd like to start by laying out a few additional thoughts on the detail that Rick just walked you through. As discussed, this quarter was all about the daily process of adjusting home prices to find market clearing values in each individual community. As noted, our starts and sales pace for the quarter were 4.4 homes and 4.0 homes, respectively. This gap between starts pace and sales pace comes from the time it takes to make the pricing adjustments necessary to be perceived as value by the consumer. Finding that value proposition is a process that takes several weeks and is ongoing. In other words, once market pricing is found through discovery, the market often experiences further adjustments, and a new value proposition must be discovered. As we went through the process of finding clearing prices in communities, this informed our decision-making, which enabled broader pricing adjustments, leading to our improved sales pace across our entire platform for the month of August. As Stuart noted, our operators use our dynamic pricing model to help them understand the timing of inventory as it moves through the construction process. This tool gives us visibility into sales pace and associated pricing by community and even by plan, allowing us to maintain our starts pace without building up excess inventory. Our inventory position at the end of the quarter was just over 500 completed unsold homes or 0.4 homes per community. Next, I want to discuss our land focus in the third quarter. As expected, we focused a lot of attention on reassessing every land deal in our pipeline along with updating our underwriting. Based on our intense review, we move forward only on those deals with starts in 2023 and where we were also confident in the updated financial underwriting. Most of the land deals we closed on in the quarter came from our strong land relationships with existing structured quarterly takedowns. These takedowns are deals where we would be starting the homes quickly and still projected healthy margins. All other deals based on the updated underwriting, either had its timing delayed, was restructured or we did not proceed. Our intensified focus on our land-light strategy was evidenced by our controlled home site percentage increasing to 63% at the end of the third quarter, up from 53% last year. We also further reduced the years of owned home sites to 2.9 years at the end of the third quarter, down from 3.3 years last year. And we reduced the number of home sites purchased in the third quarter to about 13,100, down 21% and 25% year-over-year and sequentially, respectively. Our extreme focus on a deal-by-deal review and adherence to our disciplined land lighter model drove the significant improvement in the strength of Lennar's balance sheet, as Stuart discussed. Now, I'd like to turn to the current state of the supply chain. Our third quarter continued presenting some favorable cycle time results while still dealing with ongoing disruptions from certain material shortages. Although it was minor, it's still significant that we achieved a three-day reduction in cycle time in Q3 from Q2. Additionally, over 50% of our markets experienced cycle time reductions in the third quarter compared to 25% in the second quarter. The primary material disruption in the third quarter was related to the delivery of electrical equipment such as switchgear, multimeter boxes and pad-mounted transformers. Construction labor remains very tight as industry-wide high levels of volume for second half deliveries moves through the various stages of construction. We expect to start seeing some easing in labor as the overall industry reduces the level of construction starts. This easing should start to first occur in the fourth quarter with front-end trades and in the first quarter with finished trades. As expected, cost increased in our third quarter as increases from lumber that spiked in Q1 flowed through our third quarter closings. We also saw increases in other material costs and labor in Q3 closings, resulting in a total direct construction cost increase of 6% and 21% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively. As a reminder, the drop in lumber prices we saw earlier in the year materially benefited the cost of our starts in the third quarter and will flow through deliveries in the first half of 2023. Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then turn to Q4 guidance. So, starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our Financial Services team produced operating earnings of $99 million, excluding the recording of a onetime litigation accrual. And then looking at the details, our mortgage operating earnings was $64 million compared to $80 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market continues to be extraordinarily competitive for purchase business. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. This decrease in earnings was partially offset by an increase in interest rate lock commitments. Total operating earnings were $33 million compared to $26 million in the prior year. Final earnings increased primarily as a result of higher volumes and an increase in revenue per transaction. Our Financial Services team continues to rise to the occasion each and every quarter to assist our homebuilder divisions to properly service our customers. And then turning to the Lennar Other segment. For the third quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $118 million. This loss was primarily the result of a noncash mark-to-market loss on our publicly traded technology investments, which totaled $86 million. As we have mentioned before, we are required to mark to market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, we believe these technology partnerships provide significant operational efficiencies for both, our homebuilding and Financial Services platform and greatly improve our customers' experience. And then looking at our balance sheet quickly, as you've heard all of us mention this quarter, we were laser-focused on managing our balance sheet. We focused on generating cash by pricing to market, and we focused on preserving cash by monitoring our stock space and carefully reviewing potential land purchases. The end result, as you heard us say, is that we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.6 billion revolving credit facility. This provided a total of $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity. During the quarter, we continued our progress of becoming land lighter. At quarter end, we owned 184,000 home sites and controlled 307,000 home sites for a total of 491,000 home sites. This translates into 2.9 years of home sites owned, an improvement from 3.3 years in the prior year and 63% home sites control, an improvement from 53% in the prior year. Most important, though, we believe this portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position to continue to grow our market share. Additionally, we continue to delever our balance sheet as we repaid $575 million of senior notes that were due in November of this year, and we have no additional maturities in fiscal 2023. In the last several years, we have repaid $5.4 billion of senior notes with an associated annual interest savings of almost $300 million. A continued paydown of senior notes and continued strong generation of earnings brought our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio down to 15% at quarter end, our lowest ever, which is an improvement from 21.2% in the prior year. Our stockholders' equity increased to $23 billion. Our book value per share increased to almost $79. Our return on inventory was 32.7%, and our return on equity was 21%. Finally, we received an upgrade from Moody's during the quarter. Our credit rating was increased from Baa3 to Baa2. We greatly appreciate Moody's confidence in our company and continue to be very pleased to have an investment-grade rating from all three agencies. In summary, the strength of our balance sheet, strong liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant confidence and financial flexibility to navigate this uncertain market. With that brief overview, I'd like to turn to guidance. As Stuart mentioned, it continues to be difficult to provide the targeted guidance that we have historically provided, given the uncertainty in market conditions. So, as we did last quarter, we are providing very broad ranges to give some boundaries for each of the components. So, let's start with new orders. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 14,000 to 15,500, and we expect our Q4 ending community count to increase about 5% from Q3. We anticipate our Q4 deliveries will be in the range of 20,000 to 21,000 homes. Our average sales price should be in the range of $475,000 to $480,000. Our gross margin is in the range of 26% to 27%, and our SG&A between 5.7% and 5.9% as we continue to price to market, turn our inventory and generate cash. For the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, including non-controlling interest, we expect a loss of approximately $15 million. We anticipate our Financial Services earnings for Q4 will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million as market competition for purchased business continues to increase. We expect earnings of $15 million to $20 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss of about $20 million. This guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments since that adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.2% of total revenue, and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery. We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 288 million shares. And so, when you put all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.65 to $5.30 per share for the fourth quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research, you may go ahead, sir.
Truman Patterson: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, you all have been pretty open about the fact that you intended to throttle the incentive level to really drive volumes, and the orders down 12% is I think a good result in the current environment. So your order ASP fell 9% sequentially. All four regions looked like they ticked lower. I'm just hoping you can help us understand how much of that 12% decline was a function of base price cuts, incentives, et cetera? Was it the overwhelming majority, or was there some product mix shift in there?
Stuart Miller: Why don't I let Rick take that? Go ahead. I'm going to play a role of traffic cop here because we are in remote locations. So go ahead, Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: So as I mentioned in my commentary, there was about a 4.5% incentive that was priced in the quarter. Some of that was a base price change with a slight mix adjustment as we closed a more significant amount of entry-level homes during the quarter.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Perfect. So, that 4.5% increase captures both, the incentive level and the base price cuts. All right. Thanks for that. And you all now have increased your option land 63% of your portfolio. It's been a pretty rapid shift over the past couple of years. And you mentioned that you reassessed every deal in your pipeline, and you're working with partners to improve underwriting standards. Could you help us understand if you've actually been walking away from deals at an accelerated pace? I noticed your option lot declined in the quarter. Could you discuss just the willingness of your partners to work with you all? And any chance you might be able to help us quantify what portion of controlled deals might be on the watch list or at risk?
Stuart Miller: So, let me give a broad thought process on that. There is -- there are a couple of buckets you got to think about. Some of the shorter-term deals that we have been working through that we own home sites in, those home sites continue to be valuable assets that we're working -- that we're putting into production and generating an attractive margin on even in current market conditions. We will continue to build through those communities. That's one of the benefits of shorter-term deals is they generally will work through and still generate an attractive margin. In every land deal that we have in our pipeline, we are going back and doing the re-underwriting on -- not just onetime, but on a pretty regular basis, given the movements in market conditions. And so, the answer to your question is we will walk away from programs that we have or land that we have under contract that no longer meet the underwriting criteria and where we have the ability to walk away at an attractive cost. We're just not going to go forward on deals that no longer meet the underwriting criteria. And that is the benefit that comes to bear, given the way that we've migrated our land program over the past couple of years. So, over this past quarter, there are deals that meet the stringent underwriting criteria and deals that don't, and those that don't, fall out of the filter, and we've walked away and we'll come back another day. So, we've probably walked away from something in the nature of 10,000 home sites just over this past quarter. Is that it, Diane?
Diane Bessette: Yes.
Stuart Miller: Yes. And Rick, Jon, do you want to weigh in on that?
Jon Jaffe: I would just add that we have extremely strong relationships with a lot of land partners. And relative to your question, we are able to work with them to either adjust timing, to restructure, to change pace. And that combined with, as Stuart described, just a constant refresh analysis just keeps us very current so that the land we are acquiring is turning into starts very quickly with very acceptable margins. And if it doesn't fit that criteria, we're finding the appropriate alternative solution for the asset.
Operator: Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs, you may go ahead.
Susan Maklari: My first question is, Stuart, you talked a lot about cash generation. And as we do think about the overall market moderating, can you talk to some of the changes in the business today relative to the past cycle? What that will mean for your ability to generate cash as we think about things changing on the ground, and the areas that you're really focused on investing in, in order to position the business for that eventual recovery, and where you see Lennar going over time?
Stuart Miller: Great question. Historically, if you look at the composition of Lennar, many of the builders, we've migrated away from those longer-term land positions that have really stuck us in the mud as the market has gotten slow. And because we have basically converted our land asset to short-term assets, those assets will turn over as we continue to produce through the current market conditions. And so -- and we'll replace those assets with land assets that are repriced, given the current market condition. So that's a structural change in Lennar specifically and in the industry more broadly that I think is going to be very cash generative. There are a number of things that work against homebuilders in downtime. One of them is long-term land, and that's been mitigated. The second thing I'd say is when you're growing a homebuilding company, one of the big cash users is the growth component. We're constantly buying land and putting more sticks and bricks in the ground to accommodate growth. As you migrate to a slower growth level or a zero growth level, that in itself is cash generative. So now, short-term land position plus migration to a no-growth environment, both very cash flow positive, and then the one anomalous component is the cycle time that is derived from the supply chain impairment that we've been dealing with. That has added about 25% more cash use inventory buildup relative to normalized times. As we've noted before, we've added about 2 months to our generally 6-month cycle time. And I think that's an industry kind of average. And that two months ultimately is going to find its way to resolution. We will see a reversion back to a normalized kind of cycle time in production. And that also should be tailwinds, winds at our back in terms of generating cash as we have a normalization, might take place this year, might take place over the next couple of years, but it should generate cash as we go forward.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's very helpful color. And then following up, affordability is obviously a key focus as rates rise and the macro changes. Can you talk to some of the benefits of your underlying operations and how you're able to sort of drive that narrow band between the tensions that exist on the cost side relative to what the consumer needs and the ability to get those first time kind of home buyers into a house?
Stuart Miller: Well, listen, I'm going to have Rick and Jon both speak to this. Let me just say as a general overview along those lines, the three of us just left a two-day session with our trade partners. And the partnership that exists among our operating groups in the field and our trade partners really came to light as we had straight conversation about what the market is doing and partnership and recognizing that we've all got to find a way to reconcile costs to enable affordability in the sales price of the home. That goes to our land partners as well as to our trade partners. I think that across the industry, everybody recognizes that there's going to have to be a cost reconciliation as interest rates go up. It's clear that there's going to be more increase in interest rates that we're going to be dealing with. So, we've got to band together to make the machine work, and that means a cost structure that enables affordability. Rick, Jon?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. It's exactly what you said, Stuart. It's a combination of us reducing sales prices and having the margin impact, and you saw that we executed on that during the quarter. We've discussed with our trade partners that there needs to be a sharing. Everyone made a lot of money during the up cycle, and it's time to work as partners to restructure the cost side on both the labor and material side. And in addition, as Stuart walked through the land side of the business, there's going to be some adjustments in land pricing. So, it's the collective of all three of those that we will do in order to execute the strategy to keep the sales momentum going.
Jon Jaffe: The only thing I would add is that we're also -- during this time, as Rick highlighted, we have to find the right price to match the affordability perspective and reality that our customer has is -- we look very carefully at our product offering to see where we can do some significant value engineering as well as introduce smaller, more efficient product into certain markets. So we continue to move down the price curve and meet the place where affordability for the consumer intersects with mortgage payment and home prices.
Stuart Miller: Yes. I guess, the bottom line, this is a dynamic situation. And the execution part of that is alignment. You hear alignment with me, Rick and Jon, and we've conveyed that to the Lennar organization, to the trade partners and to our land partners as well that work has got to be done, and everybody is at work.
Operator: Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI, you may go ahead, sir.
Stephen Kim: Just first question just from a housekeeping perspective, from calculating your starts, we're probably about 15,700. Correct me if I'm wrong. And then, you talked about inventory, maybe freeing up some cash. I think you said that cycle times, moderating cycle times eventually was 25%, I guess, of the growth. I suppose that was a comment about your sticks and bricks inventory. So, the bottom line is on the inventory, I'm thinking that the cycle time negative impact. Am I right in thinking that you're saying that that's about $1.8 billion of cash that's burdening your current inventory? So that number and then also the 15,700 starts, is that in the ballpark?
Stuart Miller: So, happy you asked the question that way, Steve. I will tell you that Diane has tried to figure out what the number is. And that specificity is we haven't been able to put our finger on it, but it is in that kind of neighborhood. It's a significant amount of dollars that are tied up because of the cycle time increase.
Stephen Kim: Yes.
Diane Bessette: And Steve, you are pretty close, we had about 16,000 starts this quarter, so good math.
Stephen Kim: Got you. And then in addition to that $1.8 billion neighborhood kind of number, you had also mentioned that you could see your inventory shrink further due to slower growth, more on the land side and that sort of stuff. But I assume that growth comment is temporary. So I'm thinking that near term -- the longer term, the opportunity is probably really on the WIP. [Ph] So, correct me if I'm wrong on that. But I wanted to ask about your standing inventory comment as well. You said, I think, Jon, you mentioned about 500 finished completed -- or finished specs right now. The way I calculate that that's about 2 to 3 times -- where you typically have 2 to 3 times more than that before the pandemic hit and all that on a per community basis. And so, I'm wondering, is this 500 like the new normal for you? Is this a new desired level for you? And if so, why is that if what we've been hearing is true that you're seeing that folks actually fairly actually preferring customers or preferring homes that they can move into more quickly. Just wanted to understand if there's any change in your thinking about managing specs as they get near completion, and why you might be looking to reduce that number in light of customer preferences.
Stuart Miller: So, it's another good observation. You're absolutely right. We basically run our inventory around about one home per community. And you're right, we're a little bit less than half of what normal has been pre-pandemic. And we do envision that we will grow our inventory to a more normalized level. We might even go beyond that. And the point in raising the low level of inventory is we don't -- we want people to understand, we want everyone to understand that we're not just putting production in the ground and allowing inventory to build up. We have a disciplined approach to sales and making sure that we're clearing inventory. That's what our dynamic pricing model is all about, and we're on it every day. But at the same time, your point that having some standing inventory is a benefit to customers looking for an instant movement. We will -- we haven't been able to have inventory on the ground during the pandemic. It is best practice to have a little bit more than we have right now. And we'll grow to that level, but it will be done in a very-disciplined way. Jon, Rick, do you want to add to that?
Jon Jaffe: I think you really covered exactly what our operating strategy is, Stuart. And Stephen, your assessment of the numbers is right and the consumer desirability especially in a changing interest rate environment for a quick move-in. They can lock in their rate if they buy today and create that certainty for themselves. So, that is definitely an advantage. But we're very-focused, as Stuart highlighted, using dynamic pricing to make sure our homes are sold in time. So, as they come off our construction assembly line, we're able to deliver them to the customer. And that will fall in that range in a more normalized time of about one community per week. It will fluctuate from time to time, but that's our focus.
Rick Beckwitt: The only thing I'd add to that, Steve, is as Stuart said in his comments and I mentioned as well, we're very focused on cash generation. Easiest cash to generate is the sale of a completed home. But to the extent that we have standing inventory, we're going to sell that home because we've got homes moving through the production cycle that are going to replace that. Whether it's a half or one, we've continued to refine our pricing strategy to maximize the cash and quickly sell the inventory as it progresses from stage to stage.
Stuart Miller: And then, just to add -- to go back to your earlier comment, yes, Steve, a zero growth rate would be a temporary condition, not a permanent one. But there's an overhang or an overshadowing concept, and that is we don't want to fight to take. So, we're not going to try to grow when the tape is telling us not to, and that's clearly the case. But as the market comes back and as I noted in my comments, the long-term prospects for housing are strong and good. As the market turns around, we'll be very well positioned with a very strong cash position to be able to lean into market conditions improving as that happens.
Operator: Our next caller is Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead, sir.
Alan Ratner: I guess, first, Stuart, maybe directed to you. We've talked in the past about build for rent and that space being a potential kind of countercyclical vehicle in the event of a slowdown in primary demand, which is clearly what we're seeing today. I'm just curious if you could talk to your current BFR business, whether perhaps you're leaning a bit more heavily on that in the current climate. And obviously, with your relationship with the fund and the investors there, what the current appetite is among those investors?
Stuart Miller: Great. I'm going to ask Rick to jump in after. I'm going to give a first comment and say that I do believe that single-family for rent is going to continue to grow and be a meaningful part of the housing market. I've learned over the years that SFR has always been a part of the market more dominated by the mom-and-pop participants. Now, it's been professionalized, and more institutional buyers are a significant part of the market. But that part of the market has pulled back as interest rates have gone up, as prices have come down and it has moderated. So, it is still a very small part of our production and our sales program overall. And I have no question that as prices moderate, the SFR business will push in and become more of a significant part of the recovery. So Rick, do you want to fill in some of the thoughts and numbers there?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. Stuart, as you mentioned, as rates have risen, several of the SFR players use leverage that's floating in order to underwrite and finance their deals. Accordingly, some of the investment in that space has slowed down, but rents are continuing to maintain. And as a result, they'll get -- they'll ultimately get their embedded yields that they're looking for. For us as a company, we had about 1,000 homes that we sold to the single-family rental space in the last quarter. It's probably underestimated because there were some additional sales in our communities that other folks are investing in and renting that aren't captured in that number. But it was about 1,000, and our SFR program itself was a little bit more than 700 during the quarter.
Stuart Miller: Let me just add to that and say that embedded in your question, I think, is the question of what percentage and are we ramping up the Quarterra part of our SFR program. And the fact -- the reality is that our program has taken a very-disciplined approach to stepping back and waiting for the market to kind of reconcile itself. So, contrary to what you might have thought, we're probably selling less to our own program and more to other SFR programs outside of Lennar.
Alan Ratner: Okay. No, that's really helpful. And thank you for that disclosure there. It's very helpful. I guess, second question just on the kind of the monthly cadence you described. I think, given the 4% increase in incentives/base price reductions, combined with the fact that in August, we obviously saw mortgage rates pull back temporarily, it's not too surprising to see that kind of be the strongest month of the quarter. I think you mentioned that September was kind of following a similar trajectory, which, I guess, I'm a little surprised given the continued increase in mortgage rates or the reemergence of mortgage rates since the end of August. So have you further increased incentives or gotten even more aggressive on price reductions to kind of combat that move we've seen in rates, or are you still seeing that momentum continue in spite of the higher rates?
Rick Beckwitt: Let me clarify something. So for Q3, our incentives were about 4.5%. There was probably about 3% that was base price reduction on top of the incentive with the balance being somewhat mix oriented to a lower price point. As we move into [indiscernible], we actually have been fairly consistent with where we were in the -- in the third quarter and in August. From a pricing standpoint, we're just slight -- ticked up slightly from an incentive standpoint. Our actual net sales price is up higher than it was in August. That might be mix. And from a cancellation rate, we're right on top of where we were for the quarter. So, we are -- and from a sales pace standpoint, we're very consistent with where we were in August. So, we haven't seen any dramatic changes. I think what this is really demonstrating is we really fine-tuned our sales execution strategy.
Alan Ratner: Got it. That's great to hear.
Stuart Miller: We are finding the market, and we are finding the market primarily with primary buyers. And as we find the market, there's demand out there, but the demand needs affordability. So, that's basically what's happening.
Alan Ratner: To that point, Stuart, if I could sneak in one more. It sounds like many of your competitors have been a bit more reluctant to be as aggressive as you have on the pricing side. So I'm curious if you're seeing more builders of late kind of respond in force to try to match what you guys are doing and presumably one or two of the other larger builders are doing, or is there really a clear divergence right now in terms of strategies out there, some builders trying to hold on to margin as long as possible and others trying to find the market as you guys are doing?
Stuart Miller: Look, it's a mixed bag. There are some builders that are going along with the program that we have in place. There are a lot of others that have different strategies. The smaller builders are reacting a little differently than some of the larger builders. And that's just -- that adds to the choppiness of the market condition. All I can tell you is that market by market, we know exactly what the competitors are doing. We see the inventory buildups where they're happening. We see the migration to sell to price, hold and wait and ultimately, falling off the cliff and saying reconciliation. Each of these plays out in each market. That's why we emphasize our dynamic pricing model to each of our divisions because that's what keeps us tuned into the competitive field, exactly what's happening and making the judgments that are necessary. I think Rick said it really well. This is an art, not a science. And we are playing the game in each market that exists by knowing what the competitive field is and reacting to it.
Operator: John Lovallo with UBS, you may go ahead, sir.
John Lovallo: Thank you for taking my questions, guys. The first one is, can you just help us on the sequential walk in gross margin from 3Q to 4Q? It's about 270 basis points at the midpoint. How much is base price reductions? How much is other incentives, rising costs? And how much of an offset is sort of the typical seasonal operating leverage?
Stuart Miller: Rick, why don't you take that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. So, putting cost aside, I would say that half of it was probably sales incentives. 40%, 30% of it was base price reductions, and the balance was probably some cost and mix. Jon?
Jon Jaffe: I think that's right. As we've talked about on prior calls, the second half and the fourth quarter will be our peak construction cost as the highest lumber work through that. And that will start coming down at the very end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. So, that makes sense what you said, Rick. And clearly, the biggest driver is what we're doing to adjust to market to keep our sales pace.
Stuart Miller: Yes. Let me just add to that and say that in addition to pricing and base price as well as incentives management, we're also managing our backlog, recognizing that as prices adjust, we also sometimes have to go back to our backlog. We don't want to turn yesterday's sales and customers into a cancellation. And so, there's some administration of that as well. And so, a lot of moving parts in the walk from third quarter to fourth quarter margins. It's not as linear as just what the new sales are.
John Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful, guys. Thank you. And then, maybe switching gears to Quarterra. Third-party equity commitments for the asset management business, I think, were $4 billion last quarter. What has that grown to? And how much third-party capital has been committed to the land strategies?
Stuart Miller: We haven't put those numbers out, so I really can't put those numbers on the table. We're a bit restricted as to what we can disclose at this point. And we're going to do something more comprehensive and putting together a conference call to really let all of those pieces and numbers be known as we're getting ready to actually go public. So, I say it again, stay tuned.
Operator: Mike Rehaut from JP Morgan, sir, you may go ahead.
Mike Rehaut: Just wanted to get a sense directionally for gross margins at least as we think past the fourth quarter. And obviously, I totally appreciate you're not giving guidance for a good reason at this point for fiscal '23. But, as we think about maybe the first quarter or two, and you look at the 4.5% average incentive for the quarter, and you ended August around 6%. So, you're talking about another 150 bps -- if we just kind of held things there and also held costs, and I know you're working hard on costs as well. But is that a good starting point to think about the difference between first quarter '23 gross margins and what you're doing currently that additional 150 bps again, holding other understandably key variables constant?
Stuart Miller: So Mike, I think the best way for me to answer this is to say that we have decidedly not given guidance for the fourth quarter because there are so many moving parts. We recognize the best we can do is give some boundaries to help the modeling. I think that there -- it gets even more complicated as we go out to the first quarter. So, we're not going to wade into those waters simply because there's a lot moving around. As we sat yesterday and listened to Chair Powell lay out kind of his thinking for the way forward, it just helps us recognize that that we're living in a dynamic environment that's going to change a lot of things month by month, quarter by quarter. And we're focused on week by week. Our management team gets together every other day to coordinate, to find alignment and to look at the patterns that are revealing themselves real-time in the marketplace, and each market is different. So, I guess, that's a big and long-winded excuse, but we're not really going to weigh in on our first quarter numbers right now.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. I appreciate that. I guess, similarly, at the risk of asking another question that might be hard to answer, but directionally, how should we think about community count in '23? Obviously, this year, you're looking to end with some sequential growth 3Q to 4Q. Given the moderation in sales pace, obviously, delays and such can impact the rate of openings. But is growth how we should think about next year? And if so, any sense of degree of magnitude?
Stuart Miller: Great question. We've given that a considerable amount of thought. I'm going to turn to Rick in a second on this because this is his favorite topic. But we are thinking about community count growth into next year. I can't prove it right now, but we think that there's going to be some comparable reconciliation in land pricing, which will enable us to find opportunities that will rightsize for current market conditions. But we're going to have to wait and see on that. Rick, could you add to that?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, community count is so tricky because it has -- it's impacted by your sales pace and your existing communities, development timing, whether it's internal development or third-party developers and whether they get the communities done at the appropriate time. Sitting here today, we believe our community count will increase in 2023, probably a single-digit, low single-digit increase. And that could be skewed by what happens in the land market because as other builders may walk away from deals that have finished home sites that will look good for us from an underwriting standpoint because of our low-cost structure, we may find some opportunities to add to community. But as Stuart said, it's a tough read right now, but it looks slightly up.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, Mike. All right. We'll wrap it up there. I want to thank everyone for joining us. These are tricky times, but this is a seasoned management team that's been there -- been here before. We have a game plan, strategy. You can expect that we're going to be adhering to that strategy with certainty and look forward to reporting back as we get to the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'm here in Miami and I'm joined by Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Rick Beckwitt, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; and Bruce Gross, CEO of our Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from. As usual, I will give a macro and strategic overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about our markets around the country. Jon will update our land program and supply chain and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight. And as noted in our press release, give some very limited boundaries to assist in go-forward thinking and modeling. And then of course, we'll answer as many questions as we can, please limit to one question and one follow-up. So let me begin and start by saying that we're very pleased to announce another hard fought and well executed quarterly performance by the associates of Lennar. Throughout our second quarter, we continue to sell homes and still offset higher land, labor, and material costs. Our gross margin as reported was 29.5%, net margin was 23.4%. They continue to drive very strong cash flow and bottom line results, as we continue to refine our business model for durability with a very efficient SG&A of 6.1%, which is a 150 basis point improvement over last year and a record for third quarter. With this strong performance and cash flow, we have continued to fortify our balance sheet with $1.3 billion of cash, nothing drawn on our revolver and a 17.7% debt-to-total cap rate ratio, as compared to 23.1% last year. Accordingly, we're very well-positioned to pay down another $575 million of debt later this year, as it comes due and further strengthen our balance sheet. We also managed our sales price and pace through the second quarter and increased new orders by 4% year-over-year, even though we began to see signs of weakening in the overall market. This weakening has continued into the third quarter. The housing market has cooled as expected in response to the Fed's aggressive and rapid reaction to inflation. The resulting very rapid almost doubling of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate in six months has had the desired effect of slowing price appreciation and moderating demand by increasing monthly payment costs and reducing affordability. While the market has cooled, it has clearly not stopped. Demand remains reasonably strong as buyers still have down payments and have attractive credit scores and can qualify. Household formation has continued to rise and although, we have adjusted some prices in many markets, those prices remain higher on a year-over-year basis. Buyers are seeking shelter from inflationary pressures as scarce rentals drive rents higher. Supply remains limited across the country and the need for affordable workforce housing continues to be at crisis levels. Clearly, production must catch up to the growing household numbers as production of dwellings over the past decade has lagged -- has lagged prior decades by as many as 5 million homes. Nevertheless, the rapid increase in interest rates together with price appreciation have created at least sticker shock and perhaps a more structural cooling of demand. In a few minutes, Rick is going to give a more detailed overview market by market review that will give a more comprehensive snapshot as to what we have seen to-date. Although, these preliminary reflections of market conditions are not as positive of the state of the market, indicators have been building since the Fed's tightening began, and given the Fed's expressed conviction to combat inflation by the definitive statements made recently. It seems that these trends will harden as the Fed continues to tighten until inflation subsides. While we can choose to fight against the trend, the reality is that the market has been changing and we are getting ahead of it by making all necessary adjustments. So what is the playbook going forward? We're going to keep it simple and we're going to adhere to our core strategies. To begin, we are going to sell homes adjusting price -- pricing to market conditions and maintaining reasonable volume. We have discussed over the past years that we have had a housing shortage across the country. We will continue to build as prices moderate and adjust in order to fill that shortfall and provide much needed workforce housing across markets. As we have noted many times in the past, whether the market is improving or declining, we deploy our dynamic pricing model week by week to price product to current market conditions in order to maximize pricing and margin, while we maintain a carefully limited inventory level. As the market moves, we will continue to be responsive. In sync selling homes, we will continue to leverage our extraordinary management team across the country and improve our cost of doing business. We have seen quarter-over-quarter improvements in our SG&A over the past years and we expect to drive efficiencies through technology and process improvement to offset market adjustments wherever possible. Next, we will continue to focus on cash flow and bottom line to protect and enhance our extraordinary balance sheet. Our great success over the past years to rise from the successes around careful land management and inventory controls which have driven cash flows, enables us to reduce our debt, repurchase shares of stock, and drive shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we repurchased another 4.1 million shares of stock for approximately $320 million and drove our return on equity to 21.4%, a 260 basis point improvement over last year. Finally, we will conclude our long planned spin-off by year-end. As we have continued to refine the three verticals of our spin company, we will spin a mature asset management company into the public markets along with billions of dollars of assets under management that we previously held on Lennar's books. The final spin of our new company, which we will call Quarterra, will trade under the stock symbol Q, and as we have noted before, will be an asset light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. By finalizing the spin, we will further reduce Lennar's asset base by another estimated $2.5 billion, which will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base and will not result in a material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share. We're very excited about the future prospects for Quarterra as this will be the second spun company in our history and we have great confidence in the future -- in the prospects for its future. So let me conclude by saying that while the market might be shifting and adjusting to a new higher interest rate environment, we at Lennar are prepared. We are extremely well positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and to succeed in this evolving housing market. We recognize that the interest rates are rising and inflation continues to be a legitimate threat. We know that the Fed is determined to curtail inflation and this will take some time, but we also know that we can adjust as the market changes and we will. We also know the difficulties in the supply chain continue to persist and we know that land and labor remain in short supply. And we know that cash flow matters and that a strong balance sheet enables us to operate from a position of strength. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we recognize that there are challenges in the market that we must carefully regard expect that we will meet the challenges and that we will continue to adjust to maximize opportunity and drive Lennar into an ever better future. With that, let me turn over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market has been reacting to a significant increase in mortgage rates, increased sales prices, continued inflation and the impact of a declining stock market. These changes accelerated during the quarter with May marking the most pronounced impacts. With this in mind, I would like to focus my comments today on the monthly changes during our quarter, current sales environment in our markets and our strategic and operating focus as a company. During the second quarter, our new sales orders increased 4% from the prior year on flat year-over-year community count. Sales pace per community increased from 4.8 to 5 sales per month. We continue to sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize prices and offset potential cost increases. During the quarter, we saw a year-over-year increases in new sales orders in each month of the quarter, with a variance of less than 125 sales orders between each monthly total. Our sales incentives on new orders during the second quarter were down 10 basis points year-over-year. However, the percentage did increase sequentially each month during the quarter with May new sales order incentive totaling 1.6% of the gross sales price of the home. While the sales percentage in May marked the high point during the quarter, it was still relatively low from a historical perspective. In fact sales order incentives in May were slightly lower than the average new sales ordering incentive for the latest 12 months. Our cancellation rate during the quarter totaled 11.8%, which increased sequentially during the quarter, but was significantly below our long-term historical average. We ended the quarter with only approximately 250 completed homes that were installed across our national footprint, putting us in a great position in a soft new sales environment. So far in June, new orders, traffic, sales incentives and cancellations have worsened in many of our markets due to a rapid spike in mortgage rates and headwinds from negative economic headlines. Many markets have also slowed as we've entered a seasonably slower part of the year. I'd now like to give you some color on our markets across the country. They really fall into three categories: one markets, reflecting no and minimal impacts; two, markets reflecting modest impacts; and three, markets reflecting more significant impacts. During the second quarter and so far in June, we had 19 markets continue to perform well. These include our six Florida markets, New Jersey, Maryland, Charlotte, Indianapolis, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Phoenix, San Diego, Orange County and the Inland Empire. All of these markets are benefiting from extremely low inventory and many are benefiting from the strong local economy, employment growth and in migration. While these markets have continued to be strong, our sales pace and pricing power has started to flatten or has flattened in each of these markets. The main sales -- maintain sales momentum, we have offered mortgage buydown programs and normalized market incentives. Our category two markets, which reflects a modest softening in pricing and a slowdown in the markets, includes 10 markets. These included Atlanta, Colorado, Charleston, Middle Beach, Nashville, Philadelphia, Virginia, the Bay Area, Reno and Salt Lake City. In each of these markets, traffic had slowed and we've seen an uptick in cancellation rates. While inventory is limited in each of these markets, we had to offer more aggressive financing programs and targeted price reductions to reduce our sales pace to keep our sales pace in line with our production schedule. Selectively reducing the sales price to solve for a mortgage payment that works for our buyers has worked well in these markets. Notwithstanding these price increases, net pricing remains higher than year ago periods. Our category three markets, which reflect a more significant market softening and correction, includes seven markets. These include Raleigh, Minnesota, Austin, Los Angeles, The Central Valley, Sacramento and Seattle. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing these markets and what we're doing strategically from a sales standpoint. Raleigh was an extremely strong market in the second quarter, but softened significantly at the beginning of June. This stems from a combination of higher mortgage rates, steep price increases over the last two years, and some job concerns in the Texas. We believe pricing pressure will continue until the market resets and we've been reducing pricing and offering aggressive mortgage buydown programs. Our pricing adjustments have started to take hold and sales activity has begun to stabilize. On a positive note, cancellation rates have not been a problem, inventory is limited and our net new order pricing is still up on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we have room for any needed future pricing adjustment. The Minnesota market has been very challenging. Buyers have always been conservative in this market and as rates have increased, there have been a strong pushback against current pricing. There is very little in migration in Minnesota which makes pricing much more challenging because we have a limited pool of only local buyers. We have reacted with strong price reductions, competitive mortgage programs and we're solving through a mortgage payment that works, which is starting to rebuild sales. Austin has been the most impacted market in Texas, following back to back years of 40% plus appreciation and bidding more on available inventory. Higher rates in June and headlines on the stock market decline and the distressed national economy have sidelined many buyers who are waiting for a reset in home values. While inventory is limited, cancellation rates have increased and we've reduced prices in many communities on a home by home basis and have offered extremely competitive mortgage programs. These pricing adjustments are starting to generate increased sales activity. Fundamentally, Austin is positioned for long term growth with low unemployment, higher apartment block (ph) occupancy, loan and home inventory, and strong projected job growth. Our communities in Los Angeles, Central Valley and Sacramento have experienced a significant slowdown with traffic dropping off considerably in late May and into June. With the spike in interest rates, buyers in these markets have been extremely credit challenged and cancellation rates have increased. We've adjusted prices are using financing incentives and in some cases have included non-lease solar systems as part of our home package to rebuild sales. Net new water prices remained higher than the year ago period and completed inventory for the most part have not been a problem. The issue continues to be a reset in pricing to solve for the mortgage payment that works in these markets. This is consistent with what Stuart said in his opening remarks. Seattle was one of the strongest markets in the country over the last few years. The markets saw strong integration, solid job growth and sales prices that grew approximately 20% annually in each of the last two years. While market fundamentals with limited land supply and low inventory remain extremely strong, buyers have pushed back for a reset in pricing. The higher priced and highly sought after locations around Seattle has seen a significant pullback in sales in May and early June. This pullback is a result of both continued price appreciation in the first quarter, causing concern over home values being overpriced and stock market corrections, which have had a direct impact on employee stock compensation plans. We've adjusted prices in some communities to Q4 pricing and have seen a sales uptick with this correction, which demonstrates the underlying strength of the market. Once again in this market, we were at prices to still significantly higher than the year ago period. I hope this gives you a better picture of our markets across the country and what we're doing to keep sales activity going. The markets remain very fluid and we are making strategic decisions and adjustments every day. As we've said in the past, we're going to keep our homebuilding machine dwelling, maintain our start pace and price our homes to market. I'd like to now turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. This morning, I'll discuss our land position and give an update on the status of the supply chain. I will be brief as I know that sales and interest rates dominate the interest of our investors. We are pleased with the excellent progress we continue to make on our land light strategy as evidenced by our controlled homesite percentage increasing to 62% at the end of the second quarter from 50% last year. We also continue to make progress by reducing the years of supply of owned homesites to 3.1 years at the end of the second quarter, down from 3.3 years last year. To-date, we have worked with our land strategies group, which will become a vertical of Quarterra to continue to reduce our years of land owned even lower. Using this strategy, we have cycled some $10 billion of land and land development from owned to controlled as we refined the supply of just in time home sites to our homebuilding machine. Our extreme focus on the land lighter model saved us a significant amount of cash spend on land acquisitions during the quarter. We ended the quarter as noted with $1.3 billion in cash, no borrowings under $2.6 billion revolver and homebuilding debt to capital 17.7%. As Stuart noted, we are very well positioned to manage through the changing interest rate environment with our excellent asset land light position and very strong balance sheet as the foundation for that position. Turning to the supply chain and its well documented challenges for the industry. Our second quarter started presenting some favorable news. There were still intermittent disruptions and an increase in construction costs, but for the first time since the disruptions began, we saw a flattening in cycle time. Over the past four months, cycle time has expanded by only five days, which we believe signals at peak. Additionally, about 25% of our markets experienced cycle time reductions in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. There are still challenges that occur, but we are managing them effectively evidence not only by this flattening of cycle time, but also by being above the high end of our guidance for second quarter closings. Our direct construction costs in the second quarter were up 1.6% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, both lower than the comparable increases for the same period in the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2021. Rise in labor cost accounted for all of the increase in the second quarter. Material costs were lower due to the lower priced lumber from starts in the second half of last year. We expect costs will rise again in the back half of 2022 as increases in lumber that's back in Q1 will flow through those closings. The current drop in lumber prices that we're experiencing would start near the end of our second quarter will lower the cost of our starts in the second half of this year and related deliveries in the first half of 2023. Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance, so therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then review our thoughts for Q3. So starting with financial services. For the second quarter, our financial services team produced $104 million of operating earnings slightly above the high end of our guidance. And then, when you look at the details between mortgage and title, mortgage operating earnings were $74 million compared to $92 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, and as has been greatly documented in the media, the mortgage market has become extraordinarily competitive for purchase business as refinance volumes have all, but halted and resale inventories have declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreased. This was the primary driver for our lower second quarter earnings. Title operating earnings were $30 million compared to $24 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily as a result of higher premiums driven by an increase in average sales price per transaction. And then turning to our Lennar Other segment. For the second quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $108 million. The loss was primarily the result of non-cash mark-to-market losses on our public company technology investments, which totaled $78 million. The remaining loss was primarily related to other strategic investments in this segment. As we have mentioned before, we are required to mark-to-market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to believe that these technology partnerships provide significant operational efficiencies for both our homebuilding and financial services platform and greatly improve our homebuyers experience. And then turning to the balance sheet. As we've mentioned, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and no borrowing on our revolving credit facility for a total of $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity. And one note regarding our credit facility, last month, we successfully amended and extended this facility. We now have almost $2.6 billion of commitment, $350 million matures in 2024 and $2.2 billion matures in 2027. We were pleased with the execution, which was greatly enhanced by our investment grade ratings. During the quarter, as Jon mentioned, we continue to focus on becoming land lighter. As a result, at the end of the quarter, we owned 193,000 homesites and controlled 319,000 homesites for a total of 512,000 homesites. This portfolio of homesites provides us with a strong competitive position for continued market share expansion. Our homesites controlled increased to 62% from 50% in the prior year and our years owned improved to 3.1 years from 3.3 years in the prior year. Land transactions may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but progress is made year-over-year. We are still on track to reach our goal of 2.75 years owned and 65% home sites controlled by year end. And we remain committed to our focus on increasing shareholder returns. As we mentioned during the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares, totaling $321 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $111 million during the quarter. Our next senior note maturity is $575 million, which is due in November this year and we have no debt maturities due in fiscal 2023. The result of all these transactions with the homebuilding debt to total capital of 17.7%, which improved from 23.1 in the prior year. And then just a few more points on our balance sheet in return. Our stockholders' equity increased to $22 billion. Our book value per share increased to 72.12% (ph). Our return on inventory was 30.5% and our return on equity was 21.4%. In summary, our balance sheet is strong and positions us well for the future. So with that brief overview, I'd like to turn to our thoughts for Q3. As we mentioned in our press release, it is difficult to provide the more targeted guidance that we typically offer given the uncertainty in market conditions. So alternatively, we thought it would be more appropriate to provide very broad ranges to give some boundaries to each of the components of our third quarter. So starting with new orders, we expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 18,000 homes. We anticipate our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 17,000 to 18,500. Our Q3 average sales price should be slightly higher than our Q2 average sales price, which as a reminder was 483,000. We expect gross margins to be in the range of 28.5% to 29.5% and we expect our SG&A to be between 6% and 6.5%. For the combined homebuilding, joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a loss of about $10 million. And then, as we anticipate our financial services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $70 million to $75 million as market competition for purchase business continues to increase. We expect earnings of about $20 million our multi-family business and for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss of about $20 million. This guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments since those adjustments will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues. Our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 24% and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 288 million shares. So when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of approximately $4.55 to $5.45 per share for the third quarter. And then turning to the full year, as we mentioned, we're maintaining our previous deliveries guidance of approximately 68,000 homes for the year. However, at this time, recognizing that market conditions are fluid, we will not be providing updated guidance for the other components of earnings. We do look forward to updating our thoughts for Q4 on our next earnings call. With that, let me turn it back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Exciting times. Appreciated all the color you gave on the call. There was a couple of comments you made about incentives and lumber, and you also gave a range of guests for 3Q gross margins. And so I was curious, it was a pretty strong 3Q gross margin number. And I was curious, how much of the sequential increase in incentives is envisioned in that guidance? I think you said incentives were running at 1.6% in May, so I'm kind of queueing off of that? And then also how much of a headwind from lumber, because I think Jon mentioned that there was going to be some of that. So in both cases, I'm talking sequentially from what you experienced in 2Q?
Jon Jaffe: 32:06 Hey, Stephen. It's Jon. So relative to incentives, they're still relatively low. As Rick mentioned, we're calling about 1.6% of our -- that's what we're seeing today's market -- in some of those markets as they continue to adjust. It might get a little bit more. In lumber, what's flowing through our numbers and is already in our backlog, which gives us comfort our guide on gross margins is about a $6 a square foot increase from our start over the year. So we have good visibility to exactly what that is.
Stuart Miller: Right. Let me just add to that Steve, most of what you're seeing flowing through our third quarter is already in backlog. So it's not just lumber that's in backlog, it's also many of the incentives. There will be some cancellations and some rotation through. And so we'll see some movement through the quarter. And as we noted, given the changing environment it’s going to be hard to say what actually the numbers are going to round out to be. There's going to be some averaging. Just remember that on the third quarter, we have a pretty good sense of visibility given the fact that a lot of our backlog is focused on the third quarter.
Stephen Kim: Yeah. That's a fair point. And so I guess in regards to that, I was curious as to the exposure to cancellations, a lot of the builders -- well, all the builders, really, except you guys are sort of providing your documents, how much earnest money deposits they collect from their customers as a percentage and we look at that as a percentage of the ASP. I was curious, if you could talk about that and the other part of my question relates to the single-family rental business because Rick when you were going through all your markets. It was interesting you didn't really talk much about rents, but obviously that's an important part of the equation. I know that the single-family rental, appetite to acquire units has been really strong, but people are talking about whether that bids going to disappear in the current environment. And so, I was wondering if you could just sort of talk about the ability of your company to actually benefit unlike in cycles past from some of the rising rates pushing business into the rental arena?
Rick Beckwitt: So first let me address the question on backlog and deposits. One of the things that our mortgage company has done is really attack and lock our Q3 and Q4 backlog. We've had a very concentrated effort to make sure that people have mortgages in place so that when closing comes up, they're good to go.
Jon Jaffe: Just mortgages in place, but interest rate dropped.
Rick Beckwitt: The interest rate dropped.
Jon Jaffe: Yes. And what was the back part of that question, Steve?
Stephen Kim: It was referring to the single family rental appetite for newly built homes.
Stuart Miller: So let me say, Steve, that the entire rental market is interesting right now. We've talked a lot over the quarters about housing shortage. The fact is that even as interest rates go up, people still need a place to live household formation remains strong. I know you've covered a lot of these dynamics. And at the end of the day, we're probably going to push more people from homeownership towards rental that will mean multi-family, traditional multi-family as well as single family for rent. And I think there's going to be some dynamic shifting that moves around in all of these areas to the extent that we move more people out of home ownership and towards rental, it increases the demand for an already supply constrained component of the market, that's the rental market both SFR and traditional rentals. If you look at rental rates, and where they have been moving over the past year, both on the traditional rentals and the single-family for rent, you've seen pretty aggressive movements upward in rental rates. That is a function of limited supply and growing demand. So how this is going to play out, as part of what we point to as some of the confusion or some of the question marks that sit out there over the next quarters as the market reconciles to a new interest rate environment, rental rates that are moving and shifting and even the SFR buyers are going to have to rethink what their model looks like. They have higher interest rates in their capital stack, but they also are getting higher rental rates from their customers. So we're going to have to see how that plays out.
Rick Beckwitt: And as I said in my comments, Jon, Stuart and I are making daily adjustments to pricing to make sure that we maintain them and those adjustments incorporate what's going on with rents in the single-family communities and the investment buyer.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks.
Stuart Miller: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Buck Horne: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the time. I wanted to talk a little bit about the pace of starts that you maintained through the second quarter. It's interesting that the starts pace was still well ahead of the absorption pace even as mortgage rates were consistently rising through the quarter, was that a function of the quality of the traffic you were seeing or that the buyers that you saw coming in the front door in terms of their ability to purchase? Was there some larger thinking in terms of maintaining the starts pace at that elevated run rate?
Stuart Miller: I think we've noted before our start pace is primarily a function of an orderly program of building and delivering homes on a recurring basis. Our start pace has been more constrained by the availability of permits and people to actually generate the entitlements and permits that are required in order start a home. And so you'll see some variability in our starts as we look ahead to our third quarter, we actually see some modest pullback just because the difficulty in getting permits out. As I've said in my comments and I'll say again, we've been looking at over the past years a supply -- a limited supply of housing across the country. And while the country goes through the interest rate and sales price kind of reconciliation or rebalancing, we're going to continue and orderly start program even as demand moves up and down, we'll adjust pricing in order to get the appropriate amount of deliveries into the system to make up some of the work force efficiencies that exist in most major markets.
Rick Beckwitt: And we've said over the past years that we match our sales to our start pace versus the other way around to maintain that orderly discipline that Stuart described. We feel that gives us much better control of our cost inputs and then keeps our machine very efficient.
Stuart Miller: The other thing that is behind the numbers is that we've been -- we strategically have as we've done in the last several quarters sold our homes later in the construction cycle, which works very effectively in this market because our buyers want to lock their loan closer to the time that they're going to be closing on the home. As a result, we've limited presales or early sales which makes the start pace a little bit higher than the sales pace.
Buck Horne: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for all that. And following up a little bit on the kind of the way the pricing adjustment process works that you're managing through that. It sounds like as we talk with investors, there's still a lot of concern about potential land impairment risks with falling prices from here. But as you work through this, it sounds like all the pricing that you're still looking at is higher on a year-over-year basis. Are there instances where your pricing adjustments are reducing base prices below what the backlog customers might have already paid?
Stuart Miller: I think it's important to recognize, we have virtually no land impairment risk in our backlog. Our margins remain healthy. We remain focused on recognizing that prices are going to move around a little bit and we'll continue to build efficiencies in the way that we create value for our customers. But our land acquisition model and our land acquisition program has been rock solid and I think the market is going to have to fall an awful lot for us to start talking about impairments once again. That's a throwback to the last financial crisis and we just don't -- we have a lot of room in margin. We have a lot of adaptability in our program long way before we start thinking about impairments.
Rick Beckwitt: Also very different from last cycle as mentioned in my comments, our land strategy is focused has been on really positioning land on a controlled position and structures that can adjust to a changing market environment, which really gives us further insulation from the potential of impairments.
Stuart Miller: And the other thing that we've seen with regard to backlog is to the extent in many markets that someone cancels out, we have a replacement buyer because there's such limited available inventory that's ready to close on.
Buck Horne: That's all very helpful. That's perfect. Perfectly answered, guys. Thanks for the additional color.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Truman Patterson: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Truman Patterson: Just wanted to follow-up, main incentives were I believe 1.6%, when I'm thinking through the midpoint of your third quarter orders gas up kind of 4% to 5% year-over-year pretty healthy in the market I think right now. Just what sort of incentives or pricing adjustments do you think are needed in the upcoming quarter kind of sequentially to hit that metric? And then also when you're thinking across the three buckets of markets that you mentioned, are there any structural items or reasons that the no impact bucket might not move closer to the second or third tier?
Jon Jaffe: Of course, let's say that the analysis that Rick spoke about in that, still we're going to focus on daily as a community by community analysis. So you got to first understand that it's very varied from each community. So even when we speak of a market that's a broad overview. Within that market, we'll have some communities that are still performing very well and some that need the assistance with incentives or mortgage rate buydowns that were described. And as it was said, it's very hard to look forward as there is this rebalancing between price and interest rates of very exactly when incentive will be needed and that's why I say, regular focus on a community by community analysis.
Stuart Miller: As I said in my opening remarks, our incentives have still historically run much higher than the 1.6% level. As we look forward, there's probably another point 1% that has been factored into our go forward look with regard to incentives. And as Jon said, that could be 0% in some markets and a little bit higher in others.
Jon Jaffe: Yeah. But look, I'd even say don't let the 1% be a boundary or limitation. I think the fact is, you're right now hearing from a group that is looking at these numbers real time on a market by market basis and it is changing and evolving in a variety of markets. The tipping point from a Tier 1 to a Tier 2 to a Tier 3 market, as Rick properly described them, it is a matter of timing and it's a matter of supply within that market and the confidence level that's embedded in that market very hard to anticipate and you don't really get a warning sign before you see it. So you're really hearing the -- or you're seeing the picture kind of like a balance sheet, a snapshot of where we are today. Tomorrow could move a little bit one way or the other.
Truman Patterson: Yes, I know. Understood. And clearly, you all are maintaining elevated absorptions to drive returns. But next question on your old shift in your land bank has been pretty dramatic over the past several years and option or control lots are now up to 62% this quarter. I'm trying to understand whether there's been any shifts in the land market, the past couple of months from either your land developers or land bank partners willingness to option deals, change in terms competition et cetera., that by year end is that kind of 65% metric maybe kind of cap this cycle?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, it's just like for us this is all happening in real time in that same evaluation, happens with our relationships. But to-date, there's been willingness to proceed to acquire assets that are properly underwritten. And I think as we sit here knowing what we know now we have a good deal of confidence that we'll we get that -- hit that 65% target, but like, with everything we have to see how things evolve where the market goes to.
Stuart Miller: We have a couple of strategies embedded in our land program. First of all, we have some really comprehensive relationships with some of the land developers. I think we move in sync and everybody understands that sometimes markets move up. We all make money together. Sometimes markets move down, we all shift and adjust to market conditions. I think that's not a difference in the land development world. It's exactly the way that we've constructed our land development world. Additionally, Jon properly pointed out that our land strategies component of our Quarterra ultimately asset management business is a really important structural change for the company. We've built in elasticity in that program really to be able to act as a shock absorber as we go through the ups and downs of market conditions. And I think it's one of the more important structural changes that will provide stability for our land programming as we go through the years. And so this is something that we've been focusing on, anticipating gyrations and movements in the homebuilding world and building land strategies that are flexible for times just like these.
Truman Patterson: Perfect. Thank you for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the detail. Appreciate it. First question, I guess, really helpful kind of bucketing those markets there in terms of ones that you're seeing maybe more of an impact versus others. I'm curious in the bucket with the seven where you, you have been more aggressive on incentivizing and reducing prices. Are you able to quantify what the margin impact from all of those various actions you've taken is on the orders you've placed in June vis-a-vis what maybe deliveries were or orders were earlier in the year? I'm just trying to figure out, you kind of mentioned all the tools you're pulling, but it's hard to tell exactly what the margin impact might be in those various buckets at this point?
Stuart Miller: It’s why we've given broad boundaries and instead of guidance, we don't want to guess because there are a lot of moving parts, a lot of them. They're the obvious ones like lumber prices and realtor costs and variety of things that, that we can put our finger on, but then there's also operating leverage and where ASP is going to go and a variety of things. We know that we're trying to aim for a moving target and that target is moving in ways that we can't always anticipate. So the answer to your question is, we're not quite sure yet. We've tried to give some boundaries as to what we see coming up in the third quarter and we're going to address the fourth quarter as we get closer to it and see what that landscape looks like, Alan. To get more granular than that would be a series of guesses but I don't think brings any of us closer to something that's actionable.
Alan Ratner: Okay. I appreciate that Stuart. I know it's certainly moving target here. Second, congrats on the land strategy shift and the execution there getting the option share higher. I guess just from a bigger picture standpoint, when you think about the land market and you think about your land portfolio, your lot count is up about 70% over the last two years and that growth has come entirely through option deals as the own piece has shrunk a bit. Your closings this year are going to be up about 25% over that two year time period. And you're talking about wanting to maintain the start pace so even if we kind of assume that’s through this choppier period here, you're able to maintain volume. It doesn't seem to me at least that there's a real reason why you would need 70% more lots under control and recognizing a lot of that is off balance sheet. There's still a fair amount of capital tying up that land, which is on your balance sheet and presumably when you kind of move forward on deciding whether to take down these deals, you're going to have to make that decision. So how are you thinking about tying up incremental land today? Have you slowed the pace of acquisitions? And does it make sense at this point to maybe walk away from some of those deals if the market at best is maybe more flattish from a volume standpoint for the near term or intermediate term?
Stuart Miller: Well, look Alan, I think you know, you've been around us and the business for a long time. Land is the most complicated and difficult part of the strategic composition of a homebuilder. And we have spent -- we at Lennar have spent tremendous hours thinking about land strategies and how we can have -- how do we create greater visibility to our future without greater risk to our balance sheet and that has very much been the balance that we've migrated over these six (ph) years. It's what we're most enthusiastic about as it relates to our land strategies vertical in Quarterra, the ability to tie up more land, to give us more visibility, but to do it in ways where we have maximum flexibility. The ability to, as you say, if the market changes in dramatic fashion, we can pull back or renegotiate or reposition some of the longer dated strategies. The shorter dated strategies are going to be more durable and we'll be able to just build through. So what we've done is we've trifurcated our thinking around land into short, medium and long term buckets And we have carefully crafted flexible programs so that we can enhance our visibility and reduce the risk to balance sheet and enhance flexibility in doing so. And I think that's what you're seeing evolve with our company. You look at our balance sheet today, it is as strong as it's ever -- it's stronger than it's ever been and the visibility to land only benefits our future.
Alan Ratner: Great. All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just circle back also to the bucketing of the different markets and appreciate all that detail, it's extremely helpful. Wanted to get a sense of in the second and third buckets, as a percent of sales perhaps, what have those price adjustments been? And or if you could talk about it perhaps on a net pricing basis inclusive of incentives. And is it fair to just anticipate that those adjustments would flow through into the fourth quarter?
Stuart Miller: Well, as I said in my remarks, we're adjusting pricing on a home by home basis. And in many of these markets, net pricing and gross pricing is up 40% to 50% over the year ago period. So it takes relatively modest price adjustments to move the needle in order to spur some activity in these markets. What buyers are really focused on right now is just sticker shock. There's been an increase in mortgage rates and that combined with the economic headwinds, people just are concerned are they making the right decision at this point in time. Reality is that the market has very limited inventory. We're seeing rent growth in all of these markets. So folks are really just trying to make sure that they don't feel that as when they talk to their neighbor that there is a downward pull. So people are working through the process. They understand that values have adjusted. And in the overall mix of the composition of our company as a -- on a global margin basis, these are very small percentage changes and what you've seen us factoring those into the go forward guidance.
Jon Jaffe: Just one point of clarification as Rick has mentioned earlier, it's a combination of mortgage rate systems and form of buydowns for commitments, arms, combined with some price adjustments. So the mortgage component is a very important component as you deal with. Stuart mentioned earlier, people buy monthly payments. So we really -- most of the markets in the second two buckets don't see much in the way of price adjustments versus a combination of mortgage rate help with a smaller price adjustment.
Stuart Miller: And I just want to direct my partner Rick and just say, downward pull was a little severe. I think the greater pool was a little bit [Multiple Speakers]. Go ahead, Mike.
Mike Rehaut: Appreciate that. And just for clarity also, some of those mortgage rate either adjustments or areas of health. Just to be sure, I understand that would also flow through the cost of goods sold or impact of gross margin as opposed to the financial services line. Just wanted to make sure we understood that. But my second question is also kind of shifts to the Quarterra spin by the end of the year. And just I guess you said that you would expect $2.5 billion of assets to come off Lennar's balance sheet. If you could give us any sense of what the total amount of either any additional detail around Quarterra itself in terms of total assets under management, and obviously, you have the different businesses, any type of review or update would be helpful there?
Rick Beckwitt: So we're not giving regular updates on Quarterra just yet and it don't want to get locked in that bucket, but I think we've given some boundaries in our past calls as to assets under management relative to Quarterra. I don't want to give you a number right now. I don't have it at my fingertips. But what I did say is an additional $2.5 billion over time, I think Jon highlighted some of the migration of some of our land assets through our land strategies program. But we've really seen quite a lot of assets come off our balance sheet already relative to our Quarterra verticals and the way they have developed over the past couple of years. I think as we move forward, we're going to continue to see our land strategies program really continue to develop and that will benefit Quarterra. It will also benefit Lennar, but the $2.5 billion that I've highlighted is additional to the dollars that have already been -- that have already migrated from the Lennar balance sheet to the Quarterra private equity components.
Stuart Miller: And Mike, what was the first part of your second question?
Mike Rehaut: Yes. No, it's just the clarification or follow-up here, the answer to my first question on mortgage buydowns or adjustments. [Multiple Speakers] component, where that flows through on the income statement if it's the financial services or the regular gross profit?
Stuart Miller: Plus the sales line.
Mike Rehaut: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. You bet. Why don't we take one more question?
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone or good afternoon, I guess.
Stuart Miller: Good afternoon.
Susan Maklari: My first question is, you commented that you have seen some relative improvement in the supply chains and it feels like we are maybe at or coming off of the peak there. Can you give a bit more color in terms of what you're seeing on that side? And obviously as the demand does shift and moderate a bit, how you're thinking of the further improvement that can come through there?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, relative to the second part of your question, as always, there's a lag between a shift in markets and a shift in what's going through in terms of construction volume as the construction trades and the supply chain build through the backlog that's under construction. Relative to what we're seeing, as I said in my comments, there's still disruptions, but both we and our suppliers are much better positioned today. Everyone has learned a lot over the last two years and are able to respond very quickly to solving problems where at the earlier parts of the pandemic and disruption, it sometimes could take months to solve problems. We are now being resolved in days. And the two areas where there is ongoing shortages really in electrical equipment. and in flex duct. But even those were in close communication with our trade partners, that supply that they've got all visibility in terms of what our needs are for the coming quarters. It's very close working relationship.
Stuart Miller: Right. Is it the resolution of supply chain issues is not so much in the supply chain and has gotten easier. It's that we've figured out and worked hard to manage it better. We have the residual impact of the fact that our cycle time still remains a sticky kind of larger version of itself. So it still takes us longer to produce a home, which is inefficient and a derivative of supply chain management.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful color. My follow-up question is, when you do think about balance sheet and uses of cash in general, you noted that you did buyback some stock in the second quarter. As things do moderate, but you continue to pursue your strategy around land and the spin of Quarterra and all these other efforts that you've been working on. How do you think of uses of cash and especially maybe shareholder returns in a more moderate housing environment?
Stuart Miller: Well, here's the positive thing about what's happened at Lennar is over the past years, we've had terrific prosperity and we've used those moments not to sit back on our laurels, but instead to really focus on enhancing our business model. We've refined the cost of operation. We focused on cash generation. We've built models that limit inventory and limit the exposure land on our balance sheet and enabled us to generate a tremendous amount of cash. We expect to continue to think very much the same way as we go forward that we're going to be positioning our company with land visibility that enables us to continue to build our business in an orderly fashion. We expect to continue to pay down debt. We expect to continue to opportunistically buyback stock and we have the capital in the balance sheet to be able to do that, even while we're spending $2.5 billion of additional capital from Quarterra -- so -- with Quarterra. So I think that we are in an enviable position of strength. We said so at the end of our press release and in my comments and that position of strength at times like this is a great way to be positioned and to deal with the market condition. I think that's a good off road, good time to wrap up. Let me say that we as a group, as a management group, are happy to have our partner Rick back in the fold after his belt with COVID last week. He was manned down for a few days, but the company was still able to operate without losing a step, but now we're at full strength. And we look forward to reporting back at the end of third quarter, hopefully with a bit more certainty. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your line, and please enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-03-17 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar’s First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning, thank you. And thank you all for joining this morning. I’m here in Miami, joined by Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEO and President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from; and we also have Rick Beckwitt, Co-CEO and President on the line with us, and he's joining us from Colorado. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick's going to talk about market strength and land and community count. Jon will update on supply chain, production and construction costs. And then as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlights and additional guidance, and then we'll answer as many questions as we can, and we'll limit to one question and one follow-up, please. So let me begin and start by saying that we're quite pleased to announce another hard fought and well-executed quarterly performance by the associates of Lennar. Our operating results reflect both the extraordinary focus and determination of Lennar's management and operating teams, as well as the general strength in the housing market. As questions abound given geopolitical turmoil, inflationary pressures building both around the globe and domestically, and interest rates are rising, the housing market remains very strong in all of our major markets. Demand trends remain strong, as family formation continues to rise. As our team from around the country reviewed our weekly sales starts and closings on Monday for our regions and our divisions, the unanimous view was that our sales pace range in each market from strong to very strong. Buyers are seeking shelter and they are seeking shelter from inflationary pressures as scarce rentals see rents escalating and escalating housing costs can be controlled with an owned home with a fixed rate mortgage, while wages are going up, so too our housing costs. So with employment strong and home prices rising, it is best to fix these costs. Additionally, the home is ever more the control center or hub of our customer’s lives and frankly, geopolitical stress makes the security of home all that much more comforting. While demand is strong, supply is short and constrained, the ability to actually build and deliver homes has been slowed by the supply chain that is all but broken, by the workforce that is short in supply and the intense competition for scarce and titled land assets. Therefore, the supply of homes has remained quite limited and is not prone to overbuilding. Accordingly, we're pleased to report operating performance that reflects the general strength in the housing market. Setting aside for the moment, our noncash mark-to-market gains last year and losses this year, our operating performance is consistent and very strong. While deliveries increased 2% year-over-year to 12,538 homes, our gross margin improved 190 basis points to 26.9% and our SG&A improved 90 basis points to 7.5%, which drove net margin to 19.4% and drove net earnings from operations to just over $800 million and almost 20% bottom line improvement from operations. Although deliveries have been constrained by the supply chain disruption, efficiency in our operations continues to drive strong bottom-line improvement and very strong cash flow. Additionally, our financial services group continues to perform exceptionally for the company, adding $90 million of earnings, while supporting the closings of every possible home and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current, very difficult environment. Our strong cash flow has been constructively deployed, as our operations have been our primary focus. First, with the lengthening of our cycle times by 6 to 8 weeks over the past year, driven by supply chain disruption, we have more capital invested in our inventory, as we are increasing starts and taking longer to deliver homes, even as we are significantly reducing the amount of land held on our books. We are deploying more cash into shorter-term assets, while generating cash from longer-term assets. Next, we're continuing to pay down debt as it comes due, with the next tranche available for paydown in August, and that's $575 million that we expect to pay down from cash flow. And of course, we have continued to repurchase stock with another 5.3 million shares purchased in the past quarter and another $2 billion authorized by our board just yesterday.  With strong performance and cash flow, we have fortified our balance sheet with $1.4 billion of cash on book, nothing drawn on our revolver and an 18.3% debt-to-total cap ratio as compared to 24% last year. We expect our results to continue to strengthen throughout the year, as our already increased start pace results in more deliveries and as we use our size and scale and our builder of choice relationships to alleviate and resolve some of the supply chain friction. To that end, last quarter I noted that Jon and Rick, our co-CEOs have not chosen to sit idly in difficult times, but instead, they went to the problem and visited each of our 38 divisions over a six-week period. Well, that was last quarter. Monitoring Jon and Rick came this quarter, I noted that on top of regular in-the-field operations reviews at division offices, they have jointly with Kemp Gillis, our esteemed Head of Alfen [ph] Supply Chain, gone to the problem and visited approximately 10 of our most strategic manufacturers at their offices to engage directly the problem-solving process. This is just the beginning, as many more trips are planned, and the supply chain problem will find its way to becoming a supply chain opportunity. I'm betting on them time, focus and attention, problems are being solved and that is simply the Lennar way, leadership matters. So let me quickly turn back to the mark-to-market volatility that I mentioned earlier. Our total first quarter earnings in the first quarter were $503.6 million or $1.69 per diluted share compared to first quarter 2021 earnings of $1 billion or $3.20 per diluted share. These numbers include our mark-to-market loss this quarter and gain last year at this time. Let's avoid confusion. We have made significant strategic investments in various new technology companies that are working to reshape various parts of our company and our industry. Some are disruptors and some are enhancers. All of them are core to the future of, as well as the presence of our core operating platform. They have informed change in the core that have reduced SG&A and production costs. These cost reductions have made the investment in the company and the and the LenX strategy extremely valuable in creating long-term shareholder value. These investments are also the tip of the spear in identifying and engaging our substantial industry-leading sustainability initiatives from solar on the rooftop to microgrid technology across the community, from water conservation to sustainable cement, our LenX strategy is setting the course from Lennar's sustainable future. A number of our LenX investments have matured and become public companies and their short-term market price movements are volatile. And that volatility runs through our earnings. On the one hand, this causes some confusion on both the upside and the downside. For example, in Q1 2021, we reported a $470 million mark-to-market profit, and in Q1 of 2022, this quarter, we reported $395 million mark-to-market loss. On the other hand, these investments have been stepping stones to our higher gross margins, as well as our never been lower SG&A at 7.5% in the first quarter, which is now the lowest we have ever seen in the first quarter. These are non-monetary and non-operational profits and losses, and they really do not reflect the state of the housing market, or the operating performance of the company within that market. With that said, we choose not to sell the ownership in these companies, just because they go public. Instead, we are strategically engaged in the businesses because -- in the businesses of these companies and because we are very enthusiastic about the future of these businesses and our LENX strategy. And of course, you can expect to hear a lot more about this part of our business in the future. Now, finally, let me talk briefly and update our progress on SpinCo and are focused on becoming a pure-play homebuilding company. As noted last quarter, we filed our private letter ruling with the IRS. Since then, we've taken the next step with SpinCo and filed our confidential Form 10 filing in February, so we can control the timing of the spin. We have received, since then, our first round of comments from the SEC. We have also initiated the process with the NYSE to have the shares of SpinCo listed. Nevertheless, given the choppiness of the capital markets and the work that is still being completed, we're pushing our expectations for the actual execution to the third or fourth quarter of this year. We have noted before that the spin company will be an asset-light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. Many of the assets targeted for SpinCo will be either part of the limited balance sheet of SpinCo or are currently being monetized in the form of assets under management that will be housed within the private equity verticals of SpinCo, or they're being resolved and monetized in other ways. Additionally, while we are taking more time to execute the spin, we continue to migrate assets from the Lennar balance sheet into the assets under management that will comprise SpinCo. Therefore, we are growing the management fees and returns that will define the value of the spun company. This monetization has been and will be completed over the next year or so and the cash proceeds will be deployed in Lennar to fortify the balance sheet and/or to continue to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis. As a reminder, our three core verticals of SpinCo have been identified in business plan and are already growing AUM and fee generation. They are multifamily, single-family for rent and land strategies. Each of these verticals already have raised and are continuing to grow third-party capital and our active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform, had almost $10 billion of AUM at the end of 2021. And as of the end of our first quarter, had approximately $10.7 billion of gross capital under management and is very close to our first closing for our third fund. LSFR, our single-family for rent platform, has grown from approximately $1.2 billion of assets deployed at the end of 2021 to approximately $1.9 billion deployed as of the end of our first quarter. And our land strategies platform, which is still being refined for SpinCo, expects to have $4 billion to $5 billion of assets under management at the time of the spin. As I've noted in the past, the remaining Lennar Corporation will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base and the spin will not result in a material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share. So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that we're extremely well-positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. As I said earlier, we expect our results to strengthen throughout 2022. We are picking up steam, and we are picking up confidence. We recognize that interest rates are rising and inflation is a legitimate threat. We also know that difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar and for the industry, and that land and labor are in short supply. But we also recognize that the economy remains strong with wages rising and the housing is in short supply across the country. Strategically, we remain focused on orderly targeted growth, with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production, while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, and therefore maximizing our net margins. As we look to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued strength in the market and double digit growth for the company. As noted in our press release, we are projecting 16,000 to 16,300 deliveries in the second quarter at a 28% to 28.25% margin. And we are now projecting 68,000 deliveries for a year-end at a 27.25% to 28% margin for the year. At this pace, we will have a very strong bottom line and a very strong cash flow with a projected spin-off in the second half of the year. And Lennar will have another record year. So with that, let me turn it over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks Stuart. As you can tell from Stewart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well-coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been rent been running and finely tuned home building machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. We have continued to strategically sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize sales prices and offset potential cost increases. To that end, we have slowed sales, rather than writing sales contracts when customers visit our website or welcome home centers, we are putting people on a waiting list to contact them later when we release the homes for sale. This shift in the sales process is driving higher sales prices and stronger margins. Our first quarter results prove out the success of this strategy as we achieve gross margin increases of 190 basis points year-over-year. During the first quarter, we started 4.7 homes per community, sold 4.3 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 180 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. This production, margin driven and sales focus program will continue to improve margin and lead to increase deliveries and profits in fiscal 2022. In the first quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were solid in each of our operating regions. We continue to achieve price increases and saw strength in all product categories from entry level to move up and in our active adult communities. Let me give you some color on our markets. As Stuart said in his opening remarks, all of our markets are strong right now, but here's some color. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited. The state is experiencing tremendous job growth, with employment exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The hottest markets in Florida are Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest, Miami, Dayton, Broward in the Southeast in Tampa, Orlando is also a robust market benefiting from a significant rebound in tourism. All of these markets -- in all of these markets, we are the leading builder with the best land positions. Atlanta continues to see strong and steady growth, driven by limited inventory, relative affordability, and strong job creation. During the first quarter, we entered the Huntsville, Alabama and Florida, Alabama coast markets. Both markets are experiencing strong demand, driven by limited inventory and quality of life. Huntsville is especially thriving due to significant employment growth fueled by an influx of many diverse industries attracted by a world-class airport, a supply of educated workers, and a relatively affordable home price. The Gulf Coast is also experiencing outsized employment growth, while providing a healthy outdoor lifestyle, a favorable weather, and the beauty of the Gulf of Mexico. In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte, and Charleston are extremely strong markets. Inventory is very limited and the combination of core local demand and in-migration continues to push both sales pace and price. We are the top builder in all of these markets. Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country, with in-migration from the East and West. The state's pro business, employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and exceptional job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from a surge in oil and gas prices. The strongest market in the country continues to be Austin. The Colorado market continues to gain momentum, benefiting from strong in-migration and solid job growth. Inventory is very limited and we are seeing great pricing power. Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be two of the hottest markets in the country. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth, and immigration from California. Nevada continues to lead the nation in new jobs, with employment significantly exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Phoenix is driving due to real affordability, inventory is extremely limited, and demand continues to accelerate. The Pacific Northwest continues to be a strong market, as significant land use and development restrictions limit production to meet growing demand. Notwithstanding these restrictions, we have an excellent land position with great growth opportunities. Portland and Seattle are experiencing outstanding job growth, with both markets ranking in the top 10 in the country. With strong demand and limited supply, we continue to see strong price increases. The California markets remains very strong, driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there was more demand than supply even with much of the out migration from the state. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and East Bay Area have remained some of the strongest markets, with homebuyers looking for affordability. During the quarter, we also saw a resurgence in the core markets of the Bay Area, as employees are returning to work. As such, both our core and inland markets are firing on all cylinders. As I said, as Stuart said, these are some of the strongest markets, but there is broad strength across the country. Now, I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth in community count. During the first quarter, our community count increased 4% year-over-year as we focused on growth in our existing and new markets. We expect our community count to build throughout the year, and are still projecting to end 2022 with a low double-digit increase in community count year-over-year. While supply chain issues and inspection delays are impacting the timing of some of our community openings, we are in an excellent position for strong growth in 2022 and 2023. Our land pipeline remains robust, with plenty of land in the queue to meet our growth goals over the next several years. We continue to see great buying opportunities in all of our markets and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years, as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned or controlled. We are also pleased with the excellent progress we are making on our land-light strategy, as evidenced by our controlled home site percentage increasing to 58% at the end of the first quarter from 45% last year. We believe, we can increase this to 65% by the end of the fiscal year. Our extreme focus on a land liner model saved us a significant amount of cash spend on land acquisitions during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolver and a homebuilding debt to capital of 18.3%. As Stuart said, we repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $526 million. These repurchases, combined with our significant earnings contributed to a return on equity of 19.5%, which was a 180 basis point improvement from the first quarter of last year. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. This morning, I'll discuss how our first quarter was impacted due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary impacts on construction costs and on cycle time increases, as well as our team's ability to manage through these challenges. At Lennar, we continue to deal with our fair share of disruptions. Some of the supply chain disruptions were like the ones, we faced in our fourth quarter, where we experienced intermittent disruptions affecting different trades, at different times and in different geographies. The first quarter was also different and that the Omicron spike in January dramatically impacted everything. A significant amount of labor at manufacturers, suppliers, local trade partners and our own associates was out from work. This was most severe in January and then ease rapidly in February. At times, in January, it seemed as though as much as one-half of the workforce across the industry was quarantined at home. This challenged our management, purchasing and construction teams to be extremely nimble in finding workaround solutions to the unique challenges that the Omicron spike created.  Labor returned in February to the manufacturing plants and at our communities, as manufacturers and trades are now hard at work to make up for lost time. Many manufacturers have stabilized their lead times, and there are currently fewer situations of late deliveries. However, some manufacturers still have meaningful challenges ahead. The following categories are continuing to deal with significant constraints. These are electrical equipment, garage doors, HVAC condensers, flex duct and cabinets. In response to the ongoing disruptions and future unknown risk of new disruptions, our divisions are more closely managing the inventory of local trades and adding additional labor by onboarding new trade partners, while our regional and national teams stay in constant communication with manufacturers and suppliers in support of our divisions. The supply chain challenges in the first quarter resulted in an increase in cycle time and contributed to an increase in direct construction costs. Our average cycle time increased approximately two weeks sequentially over Q4 and about two months year-over-year. Given the severity of the challenges created by the sudden Omicron spike, I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our associates for their leadership, creativity and tenacity in overcoming this situation. Their extraordinary efforts enable Lennar to deliver over 12,500 homes to eagerly awaiting homeowners in our first quarter. As we look at the balance of the year and our guidance to deliver 68,000 homes, we are strategically focused on accelerating starts to give us more inventory under construction. This will provide a cushion against expanding cycle times, allowing our management teams more opportunities to complete homes in line with our plans. Turning to cost now. Our direct construction costs were up 3% sequentially from Q4 and 23% year-over-year. Lumber was relatively flat sequentially, but accounted for about 60% of the year-over-year increase. As you are aware, lumber dramatically increased again, up almost 100% since December 1 to $1,400 per thousand board feet. This increase in lumber will cause about a $5 per square foot increase by August of this year. Further increases are anticipated as lumber futures indicate short-term inflation through the spring cycle or into early summer. Then based on our analysis and on feedback from key lumber industry participants, we believe the deflation of lumber prices will follow. This pattern looks to mirror what took place last year with dramatic -- with lumber's dramatic rise and fall. Despite operating in this cost inflationary environment, our first quarter direct construction costs as a percent of revenue were stable at 43%, which is basically flat compared to 42% both sequentially and year-over-year. Simply put, our pricing power is offsetting these cost increases. As Rick noted, we are achieving this through the disciplined matching of sales pace to construction pace. Our divisions have been and remain laser-focused on being a production-first operation. Our execution is an ongoing refinement and improvement of our dynamic pricing and FIFO sales approach, allowing effective control of which homes are released for sale and at what price. In conclusion, it bears repeating that we remain disciplined and focused about our everything's included strategy and on being the builder of choice for our trade partners, a program, which is now entering its seventh year. This program has successfully created close-knit relationships with our strategic building partners, allowing both parties to make adjustments in these unprecedented times. These strategic relationships enable us to be better at solving problems in 2022 than we previously were. Additionally, as Stuart aptly noted, Kemp Gillis, Rick and I are currently traveling the country, meeting with senior management of key supply chain relationships to explore how to solve issues that need immediate attention and how to think differently about the supply chain going forward. We have meaningful exchanges of thoughts and ideas on how to alter the current configuration of the supply chain to reduce and/or remove future disruptions. We believe these -- the results of these efforts will provide for the fastest path to stabilization of the supply chain for Lennar. We also expect to achieve meaningfully improved efficiencies throughout the supply chain, providing for better control of both costs and cycle times. Thank you. And I'll turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So, therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then provide detailed guidance for Q2 2022 and updated high-level guidance for fiscal year 2022. So starting with Financial Services. For the first quarter, our Financial Services team produced $91 million of operating earnings, slightly above the high end of our guidance. And then, when you look at the details between mortgage and title, our mortgage operating earnings were $67 million compared to $100 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become increasingly competitive for purchase business, as refinance volumes and resale inventory has declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. This was the primary driver of our first quarter, lower secondary margins as compared to the prior year. Title operating earnings were $21 million compared to $30 million in the prior year. The prior year included a one-time $11 million gain related to the early paydown of a note receivable. Excluding this gain, earnings increased this year, primarily as a result of higher premiums driven by an increase in average sales price per transaction. And then looking at our Lennar Other segment, as Stuart indicated, for the first quarter, our Lennar Other segment had an operating loss of $403 million. This loss was primarily the result of our non-cash mark-to-market losses in our strategic technology investments which, as we indicated, totaled $395 million. As we've mentioned before, we are required to mark-to-market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And then turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, for a total of $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity. During the quarter, we continued to focus on becoming land lighter. As a result, at quarter end, we owned 202,000 homesites and controlled 279,000 homesites for a total of 481,000 homesites. This portfolio of home sites provides us with a strong competitive position for continued growth. As Rick mentioned, our homesites controlled increased to 58% from 45% in the prior year, while our years owned stayed flat from the prior year at 3.4 years. Land transactions may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but progress is made year-over-year. And so, we are still on track to reach our goal of 2.75 years owned and 65% homesites controlled by year-end. And we remain committed to our focus on increasing shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million shares, totaling $526 million. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $110 million during the quarter, which was the result of a 50% increase of our annual dividend to $1.50 per share that took place in January of this year. Our next senior note maturity is $575 million, which we will pay in August of this year, and we have no maturities due in fiscal 2023. The result of all these transactions with homebuilding debt to total capital of 8.3%, which improved from 24% in the prior year. And then just a few final points on our balance sheet, our stockholders' equity increased to $21 billion. Our book value per share increased to $69.98 and our return on inventory was 27.5%. In summary, we have a solid balance sheet that positions us well for the future. And so with that brief overview, I'd like to provide some guidance details. As we look forward to the second quarter, we're assuming that market conditions remain similar to what we see today, strong demand and limited inventory driven by continued supply chain challenges. So with that backdrop, we expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 17,800 to 18,200 homes, as we continue to moderate sales pace to match production cycle changing. Community count is always challenging to estimate as it's difficult to precisely predict when communities will open and when they will close out. However, we do expect our Q2 ending community count to be slightly up as compared to Q2 of last year. Taking into consideration the continued supply chain challenges, we anticipate our Q2 deliveries will be in the range of 16,000 to 16,300, and our Q2 average sales price should be about 470,000. We expect to continue to produce strong gross margins in the range of 28% to 28.25%, and we expect our SG&A to be between 6.8% and 7%, as we continue to focus on simplification, efficiencies and leveraging our overhead. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a loss of about $10 million. And then looking at our other businesses, we anticipate that Financial Services earnings for Q2 will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million as market competition for purchased business continues to increase. We expect a loss of about $10 million to $15 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss of about $10 million. This guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments to our technology investments. That adjustment will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenue and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered. And we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. The weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 292 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $3.80 to $4 per share for the second quarter. And then turning to full year guidance, we are increasing as mentioned our guidance for the year, we now expect to deliver approximately 68,000 homes more or less, which is an increase from our previous guidance of 67,000 homes. We believe our average sales price for the year will be in the range of $470,000 to $475,000. This would result in about $32 billion of homebuilding revenue, which would be an increase of more than 25% from fiscal 2021. We are also increasing our gross margin guidance for the year, as we mentioned. We now expect our margins to be in the range of 27.25% to 28%, which is an increase from our previous guidance of 27% to 27.5%. We've provided somewhat of a wide range to take into consideration some of the potential uncertainties as we look ahead. And with our continued focus on technology and efficiency and an increase in volume, we expect our full year SG&A to be in the range of 6.6% to 6.8%. And for Financial Services, we're affirming our annual guidance of $440 million to $450 million. And finally, our tax rate should be approximately 25%. And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet, and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are in an excellent position to have a strong fiscal year 2022. With that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research, you may go ahead.
Truman Patterson: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first you mentioned that cycle-time extended a couple of weeks, but you increased your closings guidance and starts to remain relatively healthy. So, two-part question for me on the supply chain. Just first, you all mentioned visiting manufacturers. I'm hoping you can elaborate on some of your internal initiatives that might be giving you better access to materials, labor. And whether some of the materials that you mentioned, if there's any kind of relief in sight going forward? And then the second part, you made an interesting comment about enhancing your market position. You all gained quite a bit of share last quarter. I'm hoping you can give us kind of the lay of the land in 2022 for smaller private peers in a pretty constrained environment and your ability to continue taking share.
Stuart Miller: So let me start, and I'll hand it over to Jon in a second and say that -- as I noted, Truman, we are not just picking up steam, but we're picking up confidence and a lot of that derives from the focus on starts. It's not that the supply chain is quickly getting resolved, it's that we are putting more homes in the ground. We recognize that cycle-time is extended and with additional homes under production that are farther along, we have a larger pool to draw from as we look at closings. So, we're picking up steam and picking up confidence and being able to, in the current environment, kind of, see some visibility to what we're able to deliver. And let me just say it is -- this is not an easy migration. It is taking a lot of focus, time and attention. And I just want to say that what we're finding is that size and scale matter quite a lot. That means the way that we engage with our building partners and that builder of choice kind of mentality that we brought to the table is critical and the day-to-day engagement directly with the participants in the supply chain is becoming more and more important. When you put those pieces together, you find -- we find that we're able to have greater visibility as to how our business is migrating forward. So Jon, maybe, you'd like to indulge on that.
Jon Jaffe: Yes, I think you hit a lot of the key points, Stuart. Starting with size and scale, as you mentioned, really gives us a seat at the table and the prioritization. But Truman, as you can imagine, if you sit down with CEOs and key executives of manufacturers, distributors for 4 to 6 hours, really opening up the thought process, how do we have a different approach to the products we buy, to the way that they're distributed, to joining together manufacturers and distributors to think through from the origin of the supply chain, all the way to the installation of our home. You're going to come up with a lot of interesting thoughts and ideas. And we're in the process right now of really vetting those, we'll be beta testing them and are very confident that we already see opportunities for significant improvement. And as I mentioned, it's going to give us better cost control for both us and for our trade partners and give us much more clarity as to the delivery process. And it begins a lot with our technology and our ability to give forecasting information with real clarity to our vendors, which is critically important for them as they plan how to strategically supply us.
Stuart Miller: And Rick, why don't you weigh in on market share and where we think the current supply chain programming brings us on ability to capture even greater market share.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. So, there's no question we continue to gain market share on the private builders and many of the larger or mid-market public builders. This is going to continue to happen. A lot of this is driven by really access to land. Because when we have 20% to 40% market shares, the land market needs to work with us. So those land relationships are driving a lot of the gain. And then just the efficiency of our product, our Everything's Included program allows us to work much more efficiently with the supply chain and as a result of that, we're capturing more product.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. And you all are acknowledging the risks, but you mentioned that demand should remain strong for the foreseeable future. My question is more on the land side and higher rates outlook, etcetera. Have you seen any shifts in landowner’s willingness to option or changes in land banking terms that might push out your ability to hit that 65% option target by the end of 2022?
Stuart Miller: The short answer to that is no, there haven't been shifts in appetite or ability to option. And remember that we're focused on building a structured approach to that the option program and have been working through land structures to do that. I think, that we'll be able -- we are certainly migrating in that direction with a greater portion of our land asset option versus owned and I think it will continue in that direction.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next caller is Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. You may go ahead sir.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to kind of go back to some of the comments you made on demand, and you very much appreciate the fact that you kind of stated in a couple of different instances in the prepared remarks about how demand remains so strong. I think, obviously, everyone is very, very much focused on any type of graduated difference. In other words, maybe, still remaining very, very strong, very robust. But any kind of changes on the edges? And what I'm referring to is, obviously, yesterday, we had an AHP survey where future sales component was down 10 points. Obviously, that's a national number and might be just truly more sentiment-driven. We also had a private builder call yesterday that we hosted where, on the margin, very, very minor and still, characterizing the market as strong as you did. The builder kind of pointed to maybe the first-time or entry-level buyer taking a little bit longer to make a decision, maybe, a very slight pickup in cancellations and even taking a slightly smaller home or a home further out to adjust to the new interest rate backdrop. So in that context, I was just curious again, on the margin, if you've seen anything across that entry-level, lower price point, if any markets stand out in that regard as well.
Stuart Miller: So Mike, I tried to be very clear in my comments. I noted that our -- earlier this week, management call, we surveyed almost exactly that question across our geographic footprint. And the answer is where that sales were ranging anywhere from strong to very strong. And I think that, that's the -- that's been the consistent answer by our divisions and our regional presidents. So that's what we've been seeing. Now, with that said, I also try to daylight in my comments that there are definitely elements in the economy that give rise to questions, and I know that some will kind of look for any evidence of kind of a change in the environment. We haven't seen it yet, and yet, we're very cognizant of inflation and inflationary pressures. Interest rates and the upward movement that is -- I can never predict interest rates, but it's seemingly all but certainly moving up, and we recognize that there are potential cross currency here. But those very crosscurrents can be arguments both for sustainable strength in the market as well as fissure in the market. In the current environment, as I noted, wages are going up, but so too are housing costs, the inflationary pressures on rental rates. This is really important as we look at first-time buyers and people coming into our welcome home centers, they're seeing significant increases in their rental rates and looking for a defense mechanism as stability measure that they can inject in their finances to at least hold steady one component of their cost structure. They can't really do much for gas prices and food, but their housing cost, they can fix with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. So there are cross currents out there, we have not seen to date any change in the demand patterns except towards strength, and we're watching it very carefully as you are. And we're just giving you a straight shot as we can. Across the country, it's been pretty strong.
Rick Beckwitt: And the only thing I'd add to that, Stuart, is sequentially, our cancellation rates actually went down. And what we're finding is that if something cancels, that home is gobbled up very quickly at a higher price than what it was put under contract. So the markets are strong and just continue to feel healthy.
Jon Jaffe: And Mike, I would also add that, as we mentioned, we're very carefully controlling what we released for sale. There's clearly demand across all our markets, where if we released more homes that they would sell. And people are waiting for us to release more homes. And I’d also point out one data point, which I think just supports the current state of what we're seeing, is that our web sessions online are over 20% year-over-year and the conversion of those to leads is up almost 50%. I'm just indicating the significant interest that's out there in homeownership.
Mike Rehaut: No, no. Those comments are really helpful, and I appreciate Rick and Jon, your added comments as well. It's very, very helpful. Maybe, a second question, kind of shifting to SpinCo. A lot of focus there, obviously. Just trying to get a sense, you mentioned -- kind of a two-parter here. You mentioned the land strategies component of the SpinCo that would have $4 billion to $5 billion of assets under management. Just trying to confirm if -- when you think about the SpinCo in totality, how should we think about the total amount of assets that will be taken off of Lennar's balance sheet? I assume the $4 billion to $5 billion is a part of that, but perhaps, there's incremental parts as well. And secondly, in terms of the fees that are made because, obviously, there's going to be an asset management business effectively. When you think about the fees on the multifamily, on the single-family for rent on the land strategies, how should we think about percent fees as a percent of assets under management in terms of an income stream?
Stuart Miller: So, decidedly, Mike, we haven't given enough detail for you to make those translations and we're not prepared to give that detail. In terms of the assets that are flowing from Lennar towards SpinCo, I think that it's still good math to think in terms of $5 billion to $6 billion. Some of it has already gone, migrated into assets under management that will ultimately be verticals of SpinCo. And -- but we don't have a clear translator for you at this point. But order of magnitude, from the assets that will actually be spun on the day of the spin to the assets that are being put into the SpinCo, it's in that order of magnitude. If you look at, for example -- if you look, for example, at the multifamily component. The multifamily component, year-over-year or from the end of the fourth quarter to the end of this quarter, we've gone from about $10 billion of assets under management to about $10.7 billion. I can't give you a percentage, but a sizable percentage of that increase in assets under management with actually, land and construction for multifamily that migrated into an asset -- an AUM asset management program. Relative to land, some of the land that will be in land strategies is coming from book. Some of it is coming from assets that we're purchasing that are never coming on to book. So there isn't a perfect translator. I still think that order of magnitude, we're looking in that $5 billion to $6 billion range of assets that will have migrated into that form of ownership, and you're seeing cash flow into Lennar reflective of some of that as we make the migration towards a spin-off day. In terms of the fee stream, we haven't laid out how those fee streams work, and we haven't built for the stream, yet the model of how those fees will work. But there will be that clarity as we get closer to a spin-off day.
Mike Rehaut: Great. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Yeah. Thanks a lot guys. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the land situation. It was interesting to me that your lots owned increased pretty noticeably this quarter, sequentially. I was just curious if you could talk about that because that number had been flat for quite a while. And just, if you could put it in the context of your broader overall outlook, which would seem to be calling for a downward trajectory from the 202 you own today. And then secondly, we did an analysis where we looked at where -- how much land you either owned or controlled right before the pandemic hit, and we assume that you didn't walk away from many of your options. And if you do that and work that down from whatever closings you've done since then, I mean, you wind up with a very, very significant number of lots that I would think, are probably reflecting pre-pandemic pricing. Something on the order of prior to this quarter, 180,000 lots, and then you only delivered another 12,000 or whatever this quarter. So a very, very significant percentage of the land you have still has pre-pandemic pricing embedded in. I was curious if you could comment on whether you think that, that's an accurate statement.
Stuart Miller: Okay. So I'm going to ask Diane to lead with an answer on this one because she spends all of their time focusing and assessing over the -- and Rick to follow-up. So go ahead.
Diane Bessette: Yeah. I guess I'd say, Steve, yeah, you're right. I mean, our -- look, as I said in my comments, land purchases are -- they fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. You often see a pickup in the first quarter because our land sellers are very motivated often to transact before the calendar year is over. But I wouldn't extrapolate that. It's just lumpy, and we're really focused on just making progress year-over-year. So you are right, a little heavier this quarter, but it's just lumpy and it fluctuates.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. Diane is exactly right. A lot of that was just timing. Some of it was driven -- a lot of it was driven by potential fear of tax rate changes, given some of the talk that was going on earlier in the election cycle. People wanted to avoid paying a higher tax and transacting in 2022. It's really just timing. We're very focused on bringing that down. And with regard to your question about pre-pandemic pricing and land opportunities, you're right, and I think that's why you're seeing our margins continue to improve. And the level of land embedded on a cost percentage to be very attractive. So we're really pleased with what our land teams have done.
Stephen Kim: Yes, it would seem to suggest quite a bit of hang time here in terms of the margin opportunity, particularly with the fact that home prices are still going up. And that sort of segues to my next question. You -- we know that when you look at your average price and backlog, for instance, that that can be influenced by more shorter cycle-times for cheaper homes and longer cycle times for more expensive homes and that sort of thing. But if I look at your order price, the average price you took in orders this quarter, I would generally think that those mix shift effects should be very muted. And we noticed that your average order price was something on the order of $495,000 which was, I think it was up like 6% or something like that sequentially, which is a very, very strong number. And I was curious as to whether or not you believe that, that's a reasonable level that we could expect your closings in some quarter in the not-too-distant future could reach. I know that your guidance for closings was $472,000. It seems like it's baking in a fair amount of conservatism when you contrast it with the $495,000 you did this quarter. So, I was hoping you could comment on that?
Stuart Miller: Rick, why don’t you take it?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, so we're not guiding for a $495,000 ASP for the 2022. A lot of this is just mix and timing of sale and which communities we've released product from. There's no question we are seeing a very healthy sales price. We'll continue to execute on a strategy of leasing sales and small releases to maximize that price. And there is tremendous pricing power out there. But given the overall mix of communities that we have for the balance of the year going in and the product that we've started, some of those are smaller homes that we just haven't released for sale yet, that are you going to blend that price.
Jon Jaffe: And Steve, just to add some color to what Rick said. We are very focused on accelerated growth in Texas. So, let me refer into that community-driven mix, it's not a timing thing. It's strategic and it's going to be ongoing as compared to the growth rate in California. The California is still growing and has a higher ASP, but Texas is growing about twice as fast, strategically, for us at a lower ASP.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Sounds good. We'll take it. Okay, thanks a lot guys.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. John Lovallo with UBS, you may go ahead sir.
John Lovallo: Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on the delivery outlook being raised, which is obviously encouraging. Just curious, though, what the impact from the Breland acquisition any sort of back half gross margin, negative impact from purchase accounting that we should consider? And maybe, that's why there's not that second half kind of move up in margins that some would have expected.
Diane Bessette: Yes, John, very, very small. Happy to have positioned ourselves into a new market, as Rick indicated, but it's very small. The Breland add only about 1% to our delivery count for the year. So, pleased to have a new market that's very small relative to total delivery.
John Lovallo: Got it. And then so the purchase accounting would also be very small, I'd imagine that.
Diane Bessette: Yes, that's right. Very little gross margin, as you can imagine, but again, not very impactful to total gross margin given the small volume.
John Lovallo: Got it. Okay. And then on the SpinCo, the land strategy, it seems like you guys are leaning towards spinning it and optioning back rather than, I think, at one time, there was some talk about possibly selling it and optioning the land back. Is that sort of the final decision, do you think? And what's driving that decision to sort of spin it?
Stuart Miller: I'm not sure I'm following the question. It's spinning versus selling an optioning back? Help me out with that.
John Lovallo: Yes, sure. So I'll try to be more clear. I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, that there was talk at some time of potentially not spinning the land, but actually selling it where there would be cash proceeds that would be received and they could be used for various things like funding working capital, buying back stock, things of that nature. Maybe, I'm misunderstanding, but that was impression.
Stuart Miller: That is exactly what's happening is, look, we basically, in all of these areas, stood up asset management verticals. And ultimately, they will be pulled together as SpinCo. Those verticals are -- they are currently using third-party capital to acquire assets and assets that in some instances, we have on our book. In some instances, we are buying from third-parties are going into those asset management verticals currently.  As the assets started on our book, that is generating cash for Lennar and being redeployed into the business as stock buyback, debt retirement or whatever the strategy is. But the SpinCo process is already in progress right now and the migration of assets to the asset management verticals is happening both for Lennar multifamily, for SFR and for land strategies. And as we pull that together, I think it will be clearer that some of the assets are coming from our book and generating cash to the core and some of them are just avoiding cash that would otherwise be spent. On the side of each of those verticals and that is happening currently as we prepare for the actual spin-off.
Diane Bessette: And maybe, John, I'll just jump in because you and I have talked about this. I think -- remember, you're absolutely right, there was going to be a contribution of land. But as Stuart mentioned, as we refined the thinking and thought that having a land lighter balance sheet, a land-light balance sheet or asset-light balance sheet for SpinCo is the better way to go. That was the migration into assets under management for all of the components, not just the multifamily and the single-family rental, which were always going to be assets under management. So, you might remember that we made that transition in the best interest of SpinCo.
Stuart Miller: Yes. And not only in the best interest of amount of time that has been taking to get SpinCo stood up, not to simply wait and then contribute and then reconfigure, we've just been doing it as we're going. Matt Zames as we've noted, has been working with us on this and has been an advocate for, let's not waste time. Let's get this going right now. If you know Matt, he's that kind of person. And so we have energized the program of converting assets into cash, turning cash into stock, buyback into debt retirement into increased inventory and increased certainty in deliveries and that's exactly what's been happening as we prepare to spend.
John Lovallo: Got it. Thank you guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Why don't we do our last question?
Operator: Thank you. Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. You may go ahead, sir.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Hey, Alan.
Alan Ratner: So there's been some data points that suggest maybe, more in a global kind of a housing market scale that recently, the strength in sales, at least on a year-over-year basis, has been driven primarily by non-primary buyers. So that would kind of be a catch-all for second home buyers, SFR investors and funds, build-to-rent, et cetera. And the actual primary buyer activity has kind of stalled a little bit, and there's probably a lot of reasons for that, and maybe, that's not representative of the new home market, specifically. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix of your business right now that is non-primary to the extent you can quantify it? I know it's often challenging to identify all investors that might come in through the MLS, et cetera, but are you seeing any differences in trends among the primary, non-primary buyers, maybe, over the last 60, 90 days, especially since rates have started to move?
Stuart Miller: Let me start and ask Rick to see if he can dig up a statistic or two, but there hasn't really been a big change or migration away from primary buyers towards the institutional group. But what I would say is it all seems to me to be a zero-sum game. If you look at both rental properties on the multifamily side, rental properties on the single-family side and for-sale properties where people -- primary buyers are actually buying, all of them are fully occupied. And rental rates are migrating upwards at a fairly rapid click, suggesting that these are not really institutional purchases or the building of spec inventory or things like that. It's all basically primary, but done in a format that might be primary buyer owning their home or institutional buyer enabling someone to access a single-family lifestyle or just multifamily tenants. And across the board, you're seeing pretty aggressive escalation in prices because demand is strong and supply is constrained. So that's what we're seeing in our world. Rick, do you have some specifics or anything?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I would say that probably, less than 5% of the homes in the last quarter were sold to folks that either are institutional renters of product. We sold some homes to our upward America venture that we have with are other investors that Stuart talked about that has about $2 billion of committed funds for that vehicle. But it's a very small percentage, and most of what we're seeing out there are primary buyers.
Alan Ratner: Got it. All right. No, that's helpful. And thank you for the thoughts there, Stuart. I appreciate that. I guess, second one, just to kind of end the call here. So the acquisition you made at Breland, I know you kind of talked about it being fairly small in terms of contribution for the overall business. But just curious, at this stage, you talked a lot about your views on likely continuing to take share from smaller private builders, and it's clear that you guys definitely have a real operating advantage in today's difficult kind of environment. Are you seeing, perhaps -- I don't know if capitulation is the right word, but more interest from private builders looking to sell or partner up given the challenges that are out there in the market and how high is your demand right now on the M&A front, from that standpoint?
Stuart Miller: So, let me just say that, I wouldn't -- Rick, you'll jump in, in a second, I know. But let me just add, I wouldn't say that we're seeing capitulation out there. The market is strong. Demand is strong across the board. Capitulation would suggest throwing up the arms and pricing coming down, I think that pricing is robust. The bigger issue or question for us is, we've identified markets where organically, we would like to step in and participate in those markets, and where we can find a first-class established management team and basically, make an organic step into a market, but with a management team. That's a unique opportunity. Breland is clearly best of class in this part of the world. We are really enthusiastic about the operators, as well as the assets and think that we have a unique opportunity with that one. Those will be few and far between, because we're so focused on the quality, not just of the assets, but the people, as we step into new and unique markets. And Rick, do you want to add to that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I think Stuart is exactly right. We're laser-focused on quality and professionalism, and that's exactly what the Breland opportunity brought to us. They're a great company. They are laser-focused on product that is simple to build. And one of the better parts of that opportunity was having the opportunity to create a land relationship on a go-forward basis with Louis Breland, who is an expert in finding land, entitling land, and it's just a continuation of our land strategies, business where we have that done, not on our balance sheet, but off balance sheet and controlling that pipeline. So it's very consistent with what our focus is.
Alan Ratner: Got it. And I appreciate that. And Stuart, just to clarify, I wasn't referring to capitulation on the demand side, more just the frustrations with the supply chain and how difficult that is for smaller builders in today's environment?
Stuart Miller: So I appreciate that, Alan. I don't think we've seen that yet, but earlier, the question was asked about picking up market share. This is kind of one of those markets where it kind of seems inevitable. Size and scale is working to our benefit in reconciling the supply chain. It's getting frustrating out there. We'll see what happens. We're not going to be engaging a lot of M&A as we grow our business at the large-scale side, but as we enter new markets, certainly on the table.
Alan Ratner: Great. All right, guys, thanks a lot.
Stuart Miller: All right. Very good. Thank you, everyone, for joining today, and we look forward to reporting back with our second quarter. Have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining. This morning I’m here in Miami joined by Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from. We also have joining us Rick Beckwitt, who is in Colorado; and Jon Jaffe, who is actually here in Miami, but not in the office. As usual, I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. After my introductory remarks, Rick is going to talk about market strength around the country, land and community count as well. John will give an update on the supply chain, production and construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give detailed financial highlights and additional guidance, and then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit to one question and one follow-up. So, let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that our fourth quarter and full year 2021 reflect extraordinary focus and determination by Lennar's management and operating teams across the country. While the housing market remains very strong in all of our major markets, the ability to actually execute and deliver results has been challenged and tested by the supply chain that is all but broken, the workforce that is short in numbers while driven to produce more, and the never-ending competition for scarce entitled land assets.  Lennar's managers and operators have been absolute warriors, recognizing that our customers need and want their homes and the burden of a strong but stressed market simply can't stand in the way. The proud associates of Lennar are pleased to report an excellent quarter and year of accomplishments, in spite of the elusive garage doors and short supply, the unimaginable scarcity of paint, the cabinet deliveries postponed by labor shortage, the electric meters, the windows and the countless other stumbling blocks and obstacles that have presented intermittently to ensure chaos in a production cycle that is difficult even when everything is going right.  The supply chain affects both land and construction, and that will continue into the first quarter of 2022 and beyond. But as we enter the second-half of the year, we expect that the supply chain disruption will be stabilized and mitigated by the greater number of starts that we have started, by the lessons learned and incorporated in our builder of choice relationships, and by the simplicity embedded in our everything's included offerings. And let me say that Kemp Gillis and his extraordinary purchasing team have done an amazing job of navigating this difficult landscape. I also want to warmly acknowledge John and Rick, our co-CEOs, who have chosen not to sit on high perch in difficult times, but instead went to the problem and sought for themselves, so they could be part of the solution. Together as partners, they visited each of our 38 divisions over a six-week period, met with our production and purchasing teams in the field, got a tangible feel for the most significant issues, and translated their visits into solutions. Time, focus and attention, problems are being solved, and that is simply the Lennar way. Even with the challenges in the market, in our fourth quarter, we delivered just under 18,000 homes, which is every single home that could be delivered as our customers expected and wanted their home for the holidays. We grew our deliveries 11% year-over-year, while our revenue from home sales grew 24% to almost $8.5 billion. And by remaining laser focused on orderly targeted growth, with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production, we drove a 300 basis point gross margin improvement to 28%.  Alongside gross margin, we recorded a significant improvement in operating efficiency as our SG&A decreased 150 basis points to 6%. We continue to limit our sales pace, especially as cycle times expand in favor of a significantly benefited bottom line. Accordingly, our net new orders grew 2%, and they're expected to contract slightly in the first quarter. With our sales discipline, our net margin increased 460 basis points to accompany all-time high of over 22% in our fourth quarter. This drove a 50% after-tax and before mark-to-market items, bottom line improvement in net earnings to over $1.3 billion this year. So with our focus on bottom line over top line improvement, 24% revenue growth drove 50% bottom line growth. Additionally, our financial services group continued to perform exceptionally, adding $111 million of earnings while supporting the closing of every possible home and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current environment. With the strong performance of our core operating divisions, our balance sheet and returns continue to improve as well.  Even after the repurchase of 10 million shares of stock and the reduction of $850 million of debt in the quarter, we reported a cash balance of over $2.7 billion and an 18.3% debt to total cap ratio, while a return on equity grew almost 800 basis points year-over-year to 22.6%. All in all, our core operating numbers are very strong in the fourth quarter, and we expect that strength to continue into 2022 and beyond. From a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong across the country. Demand has been consistently strong while the supply of new and existing home remains limited. Since new home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the demand, short supply is likely to remain for some time to come. Even though home prices have moved much higher, overall affordability remained strong. Interest rates are still very attractive, and personal savings for deposits are strong. Wages for the average family seem to be rising faster than monthly payments, and those higher wages are starting to be reflected in government numbers, and unfortunately in inflation as well. The upward spiral of housing purchases is accelerating. Millennials are forming families, apartment dwellers are purchasing first-time homes, first-time homes are selling at higher prices, and appreciated equity is enabling first-time move ups. The move-up home is selling its strong pricing with increased equity, enabling customers to purchase an even larger home, all this while supply is limited for everyone. And the eye buyer and single family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace. Against this backdrop, and although there has been some turbulence through the year, 2021 has been an extraordinary strategic year for our company. We established a strategic plan that included cash flow generation and debt reduction in order to improve returns on capital and equity. We also articulated a drive and desire to have a strong focus on new technology-driven efficiencies in our core business, while we spin ancillary businesses and become a pure play homebuilding company. Our 2021 performance reflects focus on these strategies, and 2022 will be an extension of the same focus. In 2021, we generated almost $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow to enable a reduction of debt by $1.3 billion, and a purchase of 14 million shares of stock for a 4.5% reduction in share count. Accordingly, our debt to total cap is below 20% and we have $2.7 billion of cash on hand. Our total debt is $4.7 billion, and will continue to be reduced. We also reduced our land holdings to three years as promised, and increased our land controlled versus own to 59%, exceeding our goal at the beginning of the year. We have almost certainly established Lennar as a technology-enabled and engaged company.  We invested in numerous new technologies, while eight prior investments were either sold or went public, which resulted in significant extraordinary profits for the company this year. Perhaps more importantly, we have invested in companies that have enabled improvement in our core business, while we have benefited both through the investments and through incorporation in our core. But this is just the beginning. We are working with numerous additional technology companies that are working to solve some of the most difficult problems facing our industry. As a case in point, we're working to solve the issues in supply chain, labor shortages and production using innovative technology in innovative ways. Many of you have read and commented on our investment in ICON, the 3D printing building company in Austin, Texas. We expect to start our first 3D printed community in Austin sometime in 2022, and hope to reduce labor, material and time as we help refine this structural production process. Alongside ICON, we have invested in two additional innovative production companies called Veev and Cover [ph], and they're engaged in innovative, factory-based manufactured solutions to production. Both Veev and Cover are focused on a more comprehensive solution beyond just the structural components, and encompass mechanical, electrical, and plumbing solutions in the factory as well. These companies are working on each of the major components of the home, and building better and more precise delivering systems that will reduce the need for labor and enhance precision and cycle time.  All of these companies are focused on the most frictional and problematic elements of the production process, and driving towards solutions for the industry. Given today's supply chain and workforce constraints, we should all be interested, if not laser focus on the success of these critical solutions, Lennar most certainly is. And finally, 2021 has in fact been a year of focus on the strategy of becoming a pure play homebuilding company. We have been hard at work refining our SpinCo that I've described in the past. As you can see from our balance sheet and cash flow, the case for SpinCo has become more compelling with each quarter’s successes. We have excess capacity and balance sheet to spin our well-established ancillary businesses, and we expect to complete a tax free spin by the second or third quarter of 2022. To that end, in November, we took our first significant in-depth to complete the spin by formally filing a request for a private letter ruling from the IRS. We are getting very close to being prepared with defined business lines, a refined business plan and a balance sheet. We expect to file our at first confidential Form-10 by the end of January or beginning of February, at which time we expect to have a name other than SpinCo and a management team in place. Some have asked about the time we've taken to disclose greater detail. The fact is, we're building a durable and sustainable public company that has to hit the ground running on day one. To that end, Matt Zames, as Senior Advisor to the company, has been focusing on the configuration and execution of our SpinCo strategy. In addition to and supporting Matt, Jeff McCall, and a sequestered team of senior internal leaders have modeled various configurations with different asset composition that has focused on getting both the program and the story right for the public markets. We have concluded that the spin company will be an asset light asset management business that will have a limited balance sheet. Many of the assets that we targeted for spin originally will be either part of the limited balance sheet of SpinCo, or will be monetized in the form of assets under management housed within the private equity verticals of SpinCo or have been or will be resolved or monetized in other ways. The monetization has been and will be completed over the next year or so, and the cash proceeds will be deployed in Lennar to fortify our balance sheet, or to continue to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis. And when our stock is on sale, like today, we'll be purchasing. Three core verticals have been identified, and business plans for the spin and they are multifamily, single family for rent, and land strategies. Each of these verticals already have raised third-party capital and are active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform has approximately $9 billion of gross capital under management, and is raising its third fund. LSFR, our growing single family for rent platform currently manages approximately $1.5 billion of equity already raised. And our land strategies platform is still being refined for SpinCo and we will provide more detail in the near future. The remaining Lennar Corporation will drive higher returns on our assets and equity base, and the spin will not result in the material reduction of either our bottom line or our earnings per share as we project them. Bottom line, this was a year of hard work at Lennar in the face of many issues, and there were no feet up on the desk during the year. So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that we have simply never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. The market in general remained strong. While difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar and the industry, the housing market remains strong and supply of new and existing homes is very limited.  We remain focused on an orderly targeted growth strategy with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production, while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, and therefore driving on net margin. As we look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market and double digit growth for Lennar. As we noted in our press release, we're projecting 12,500 deliveries at a 26.75% margin in the first quarter, and 67,000 deliveries at a 27% to 27.5% margin for the year. At this pace, we will have a strong bottom line with a projected spin off in the second or third quarter. 2022 will be another record year for Lennar. And with that, let me turn over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks. Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong, our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a fine tuned homebuilding machine, where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community by community basis. We have continued to strategically sell our homes later in the construction cycle to maximize sales prices and to offset potential cost increase. To that end, we have slowed sales to generate higher profits. Our fourth quarter results prove out the success of this strategy, as we achieved gross margin increases of 300 basis points year-over-year, and 70 basis points sequentially. During the fourth quarter, we started 4.5 homes per community, sold 4.3 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 160 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. This production, margin-driven and sales focus program will continue to improve margin and lead to increase deliveries and profits in fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were solid in each of our operating regions. We continue to achieve price increases and saw strength in all product cost categories, from entry level to move up and in our active adult communities. Here is some color on some of the stronger markets across the country. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand, as well as in migration from the North East, the Midwest, and the West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited. The hottest markets in Florida continue to be Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest, Miami and Dade and Broward in the Southeast and Tampa. Orlando has also been sustaining a strong recovery with a significant rebound in tourism. These are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land position. In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets. Inventory is very limited and the combination of core local demand and in migration continues to push both sales pace and price. We are also the top builder in each of these markets. Indianapolis continues to see strong and steady growth. The combination of in migration from the Northern markets in the West Coast, as well as affordable housing and quality of living is driving sales pace and pricing were the largest builder in this market. Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country, with in migration from East and West. The state's pro-business, employer friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and tremendous job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from a recovery in the oil and gas sector. The strongest market in the country continues to be Austin, with recent announcement by Samsung Electronics to invest $17 billion in a new chip manufacturing plant, and Tesla's announcement to relocate their corporate headquarters to Austin, in addition to finishing construction this month on a 1.1 billion giga factory. These two companies alone will create thousands of new jobs in Austin. The Colorado market picked up momentum in the fourth quarter, and we saw strength in both sales pace and price with over one sell per community matching our startup space. Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be strong markets, both benefiting from business friendly environments, real job growth and in migration from California. The casinos in Vegas are full and the city is benefiting from increased tourism. Phoenix is thriving because it's incredibly affordable. We entered the Boise market with two communities during the quarter, and anticipate having eight active communities by the end of 2022. This market continues to have strength driven by tremendous population growth. And we're excited about our land position and our Lennar Boise team. The Pacific Northwest continues to be a strong market as natural supply constraints and constraints by urban growth boundaries limit production. In spite of being land constrained, we are seeing solid year-over-year growth in these markets as we expand our geographic footprint. The California markets remain strong driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply.  As reported last quarter, the Inland Empire, Sacramento and East Bay Area have remained as some of the strongest markets with homebuyers looking for square footage and affordability. During the quarter we saw a resurgence in the core markets of the Bay Area, as more employees are returning to their offices, or anticipate returning in the near future. As such, both core and inland markets are firing on all cylinders. As I said, these are some of the strongest markets, but there is strength and depth of market across the country. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about growth and community count. During the fourth quarter, our community count increased 7% year-over-year and 6% sequentially, as we continue to focus on growth in our existing and new markets.  We expect our Q1 community count to be about 5% lower than year-end 2021. However, our community account will start to increase in the second quarter, and we should end 2022 with a low double digit increase in community count year-over-year. While supply chain issues and inspection delays are impacting the timing of some community openings, we are in an excellent position for strong growth in 2022. Our land pipeline remains robust, with plenty of land in the queue to meet our goals over the next several years. We continue to see good buying opportunities in all of our markets, and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years, as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned and controlled. We are also pleased with the excellent progress we made on our land light strategy as evidenced by our years own supply of home sites improving to our previously stated goal of three years at the end of the fourth quarter from 3.5 years last year, and our controlled home site percentage increasing the 59% from 39% for the same period. Equally important, these improvements were achieved while growing our overall owned and controlled land position by 44% year-over-year, with all of that increase in controlled home sites. Given the progress we've made, our new goal for 2022 is to end the year with 2.75 years of own home sites, and with a 65% control position. Our extreme focus on the land lighter model generated significant cash flow during the quarter. We ended the quarter as Stuart said, with $2.7 billion of cash, no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolver. And this was after repurchasing just under $1 billion of our common stock, and paying off $850 million in debt. I'd like to thank our team of great associates across the country, for their focus and solid execution to make all this happen. Now I'd like to turn it over to John.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. I’ll now give an update on how we managed through the impact of supply chain disruptions in the fourth quarter, and how we’ve planned for managing through them in 2022. As Stuart noted, we've had to deal with our fair share of disruptions. Similar to the third quarter, these disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies. They're intermittent, and they continue. It continues to be a game of whack a mole that creates stress and uncertainty in already strained labor base as materials often do not show up when expected. In the fourth quarter, the supply categories that were most impacted on a national basis were garage doors, windows, paint, HVAC condensers, and flex dock and cabinets. Regionally, there were a variety of disruptions in the delivery of materials and/or the availability of labor. On average, this increased our fourth quarter cycle time by an additional two weeks from the third quarter, bringing the year-over-year increase to a range of four to six weeks.  Despite these disruptions and the associated increase in cycle time, the team at Lennar still managed to deliver approximately 18,000 homes in the quarter as expected. This was in large part due to a record number of starts in our second quarter of 19,500 homes to ensure we had enough inventory to meet our delivery goals. Additionally, the extraordinary supply chain, purchasing and construction teams at Lennar have never been better coordinated, and are managing our scheduling on a day by day basis, in partnership with each of our trade partners. We continue to work with our partners to solve issues in real time, as well as planning ahead for our future demand needs. Examples of the strength of our strategic trade partnerships is when we had to take business away from our primary garage door manufacturer. They constructively work with us to move the business over to another vendor. When our major cabinet manufacturer fell behind due to labor and material shortages, they opened their factory for us on a weekend to manufacture 350 homes worth of cabinets in order to catch up. These are just two out of many examples where we and our value trade partners found solutions to the challenges of the current environment. Our decade long platform of Everything's Included, continues to be a strategic advantage and lessening the impact of the supply chain shortages. It's a simple program with fewer skews to manage, allowing us to plan ahead and order our material needs far in advance. As discussed in prior quarters, we are in our sixth year of focusing on being the builder of choice for our trade partners. This program has successfully created close-knit relationships with our strategic building partners, allowing both parties to be nimble and adjusting to these disruptions. We believe our strategic relationships have allowed us together with our partners to learn lessons from 2021 so we can be better prepared for 2022. We've been meeting with our key partners, along with additional new partners to allocate projected 2022 volume, as opposed to just prioritizing available volume. This way, we identify potential gaps and availability upfront, allowing for proactive versus reactive solutions. We have completed about half the categories, and will complete the remaining ones in the next few weeks. We've added manufacturing and trade partners and key categories to ensure availability, along with a continuous process of simplification through ongoing skew reductions. Lastly, we have secured alternative distribution solutions to provide safety stock at certain commodities and short supply materials. We believe the combination of all these efforts will allow for the stabilization of the supply chain for Lennar in the back-half of this year. Turning to the construction cost impacts on our fourth quarter closings were primarily from the lumber increases taken earlier in the year, that are now impacting cost as homes close. In the fourth quarter costs were up $6.78 per square foot over the third quarter, and lumber accounted for $4.18 of that increase. We will still see increased costs from lumber in our first quarter deliveries. But starting in Q2 and through Q3, we will benefit from lumber cost reductions. We experienced cost pressures in Q4 in other material categories and on labor that will start to flow through closings in the second-half of 2022. On a final note, as Stuart mentioned, Rick and I recently spent six weeks on the road, visiting communities and construction sites in each and every one of our markets. While we knew what to expect in terms of the supply disruptions and labor shortages that we would see, it was important for us to experience this firsthand so we can most effectively manage to this environment.  Importantly, this gave us the opportunity to meet with our teams and trade partners in the field, listen to their ideas, and shake their hands to thank them for their incredible dedication and effort they give in delivering quality homes to our customers. We can assure you that when our culture is alive and well and as strong as ever, we'd like to take this opportunity to again, thank all of our Lennar associates and trade partners for the incredible quarter that they delivered. Thank you, and I'll now turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet, and then provide detailed guidance for Q1 2022 and high level guidance for fiscal year 2022. So starting with financial services, in the fourth quarter, our financial services team produced $111 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings decreased to $77 million, compared to $125 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become more competitive with purchase business as refinance volumes have declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. This was the primary driver for our fourth quarter lower secondary margins as compared to the prior year. Title operating earnings was $30 million compared to $28 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to growth in profit per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in volume driven by a reduction in refinance orders. Quarter after quarter title team has been focused on automation and efficiencies with a goal of driving higher productivity. And then turning to Lennar Other, for the fourth quarter, our Lennar other segments had an operating loss of $176 million. This loss was primarily the result of non-cash mark to market losses on our strategic technology investments, which totals $180 million. As we've mentioned before, we are required to mark to market many of our technology investments that are publicly traded, and that valuation will fluctuate from quarter to quarter.  While the technology investment had downside with losses for this quarter, overall for the fiscal year, our investments provided approximately $500 million of unrealized gains. In addition, and most important, our investments continue to add value to our core homebuilding operations. And then turning to our balance sheet, for the quarter and the year, we focused on becoming land lighter. As a result at quarter-end, we owned 182,000 home sites, and controlled 257,000 home sites for a total of 439,000 home sites. Our year supply owned decreased to three years from 3.5 years in the prior year, and our home sites control increased to 59% from 39% in the prior year.  We were also laser focused on generating cash flow, reducing debt and increasing returns as you’ve heard. Therefore, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We also retired 815 million of senior notes that were due in 2022 together with 300 million of senior notes paid in the third quarter, we retired a total of 1.15 billion of senior notes in 2021. Our next senior note maturity is 575 million, which is due in November 2022. And we have no maturity due in fiscal ‘23. Also, during the quarter we repurchased 10 million shares totaling 977 million, bringing the total repurchase for the full year to 14 million shares, totaling almost $1.4 billion or 4.5% of our outstanding shares at the beginning of the year. Additionally, we paid dividends totaling $76 million, which brings total cash returned to shareholders through dividends for the year to $310 million. The result of all these transactions was a homebuilding debt to total capital of 18.3%, which was down from 24.9% in the prior year. As you can see, our primary focus was cash generation and capital allocation during 2021, but it's the continuation of a multi-year strategy. During fiscal 2021, we generated almost $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow. However, over the past three years, 2019 through 2021, we generated about $8 billion of homebuilding cash flow, and allocated approximately $5 billion to debt reduction as our first priority, approximately $2 billion to share buybacks, and approximately $600 million was returned to shareholders through dividend payments. And this focus will of course, continue in 2022. And just a final few points on our balance sheet, our stockholders equity increased to approximately $21 billion, our book value per share increased to $69.52. Our return on inventory was 27%, excluding consolidated inventory not own, and our return on equity was 22.6%. So with that brief overview, I'd like to provide some detailed guidance for the first quarter, and then high level guidance for fiscal 2022. Starting with the first quarter, we expect our Q1 new orders to be in the range of 14,800 to 15,100 homes, as you heard us say as we continue to moderate sales pace to match production cycle changes. This is consistent with the approach we have taken for quite a while. We expect our Q1 ending community count to be about 5% lower than the end of the year 2021.  However, community count will then increase in the second quarter, and we should end 2022 with low double digit year-over-year growth. We believe our Q1 deliveries will be around 12,500, but similar to last quarter, the assessment has some plus or minus to it because the supply chain challenges continue to bring a great deal of uncertainty. So the final number of homes delivered will be dependent on outcomes to the supply chain challenges, which of course we are navigating each and every day. Our Q1 average sales price should be about $460,000. And we expect our gross margin to be around 26.75%, which reflects the impact of peaked lumber prices from last year and less field expense leverage. We expect our SG&A to be between 7.8% and 7.9% as we continue to focus on simplification and efficiencies. Now, I will note again, that gross margin and the SG&A estimates will move up or down a bit, depending on the number of homes delivered. And so the combined category of homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other categories expect a loss of approximately $5 million. Looking at our other business segments and other additional items, we believe our financial services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $85 million to $90 million as market competition for purchase business continues. We expect a loss of about $10 million for our multifamily business. And for the Lennar other category, we expect to be about breakeven. But remember, this guidance does not include any potential mark to market adjustments to our technology investments. This will be determined by their stock prices at the end of our quarter. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2% of total revenue. Our charitable foundation will be based on $1,000 per home, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. And the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 297 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.54 to $2.57 per share for the first quarter. And then turning to the full year 2022, we expect to deliver approximately 67,000 homes with an average sales price of about $460,000. This would result in about $31 billion of homebuilding revenue, which should be an increase of approximately 20% from fiscal 2021. We expect our full year gross margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5%. And with our continued focus on technology and efficiencies, we expect our fiscal year SG&A to decrease to the range of 6.8% to 6.9%.  We believe our financial services earnings will be in the range of $440 million to $450 million as market competition continues. And finally, our tax rate should be approximately 25%. And so as we continue to execute on our core operating strategies, maintain strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and return, we are well-positioned to have a strong fiscal year 2022. Before I turn it over to the operator, let me take a moment to thank our finance teams, accounting, planning and all others involved. Our earnings release went out yesterday, 15 days after yea-end, and we are hosting our earnings call today 16 days after year-end. We've been holding our quarterly calls within this general timeframe for over a year. Although the timeframes have been consistent, make no mistake, the work has continued.  Our goal is to not be satisfied with what has been accomplished, but rather to make incremental progress through automation and efficiencies each and every quarter, while we compile and report our actual or forecasted results. The incremental progress is the result of a lot of hard work. So congratulations team, and a sincere thank you for what you've accomplished this year. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Susan Maklari: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on a great quarter.
Stuart Miller: Thanks.
Susan Maklari: My first question is really, thinking about the positive setup that you described, Stuart, against supply relative to demand, and that against the guide that you've given us for 2022. Can you kind of walk us through a bit and maybe talk through where you see the potential for upside and downside within that, and especially maybe as we think about the upcoming selling season and how you're thinking about some of those pieces coming together?
Stuart Miller: Sure. Let me -- before answering the question, I just want a second, Diane’s congratulations to the finance team with David Collins for the year. A lot of hard work goes into getting the year and quarter close. They're doing great job. But let me answer that Susan, the reality that we're seeing in the field as we have come to our year-end, and even as we go into December is the market remains strong. Traditional seasonality is coming back. But still relative to that seasonality, we're seeing basic strength in the marketplace. The constraining factor right now is the production cycle. And we have been decidedly focused on matching our sales pace with that production cycle, recognizing that we're going to maximize execution and bottom line by keeping those two pieces in parity. So, as we think about the upcoming selling season, it is feeling to us as we look at the market, as we look at week by week sales, traffic, demand, it is feeling to us that this is going to be a very, very strong selling season. It is going to be more of a traditional selling season, traditional selling season in that as we get to the end of February, March, we expect to see even more of a pickup. But make no mistake, it's strong out there right now. With that said, the production cycle, as I've noted, the cycle times have been extending through the quarters, we're cognizant of that. We recognize that it's a bit of, as Jon said, whack a mole out there. One day, it's garage doors, another day, it's windows or paint. And that kind of configuration is at least in our world, starting to feel like we're stabilizing it. I noted our purchasing team and the work that they have done around our builder of choice programs, where Everything's Included programs, working to really stabilize that purchasing side and logistics side of our business. And as we go forward, I think, you're going to see that parity that pairing of production cycles stabilizing and high demand in the marketplace, start to move things towards what I think is going to be more of an upside in 2022. And we'll just have to wait and see if it plays out that way. We've clearly conservatized some of our numbers to recognize the landscape that exists today. And we'll see how the market plays out as we go forward.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's very helpful color. Thank you. And my follow-up is, shifting to capital allocation, appreciating all the detail that Diane gave in her commentary around that. As we sort of look out and we think about, the community count growth and obviously the overall growth that you're sort of building and ramping the business, too. Can you talk about how you think about also balancing that with the shareholder returns and improving the overall return profile of the business, even as you kind of aim for a faster growth pace?
Stuart Miller: What is it that you want me to compare to? I missed that part, the first part.
Susan Maklari: Well, just sort of thinking about as you are obviously investing for growth going forward, right, but at the same time, you’re - it seems like you're a lot more focused on shareholder returns as well. And thinking about the considerable buyback you did this quarter, how should we think about that going forward and your continued diligence and dedication to the shareholder return piece?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So look, I think, we've made it clear in the past, and I think our fourth quarter performance relative to share buyback made it even more clear. We're in a cash generation mode. We are clearly generating a lot of excess cash. And we're not shy about opportunistically jumping into the market and making strategic purchases, I think that you can expect that to continue as we go forward. We're laser focused on returns.  We're very focused on bringing our asset base down, as we amp up our bottom line returns. And I think that you've heard that as a strategic message, you're going to see it over and over again in execution. And I think that there's a balance, we're going to pay down debt, we're going to limber up the balance sheet. You can expect that we're going to pay down the debt that's coming due over the summer, what is it $575 million. We're going to pay that out of cash flow, but we're going to continue a stock buyback program as we focus on those bottom line returns.
Susan Maklari: Gotcha. Okay, thank you. That's very helpful, and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Truman Patterson: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. Stuart, in your prepared remarks, I believe you were talking about the SpinCo being somewhat asset light, and I think you even mentioned potentially liquidating a portion of it. Is the asset spin still going to be about $5 billion to $6 billion? And then, in tandem with that, you are targeting 65% option land by the end of this year. Where do you think this could go after the Spin 80% plus? And with that I'm kind of thinking just longer-term, over the next two, three years, I mean, is there any possibility, maybe you’re getting 80%, 90% option land?
Stuart Miller: So, we're going to take that in stride and let's play that out over time. I don't want to get out over my skis. Your first question relative to the SpinCo, we have been – look, you have to -- as we've configured SpinCo, we've gone back and forth on an asset-heavier, asset-lighter approach. We think that in terms of defining the company going forward a best program going forward as an asset-light approach to SpinCo. That means that many of the assets that we targeted at the outset, will end up either in AUM or we will liquidate an orderly course on the Lennar books.  It's still the same basic configuration of asset base. We've just been -- it's all been about turning assets into cash, and deploying the cash or deploying the assets, so that we lighten up our inventory and we end up with a spun ancillary business program that enables our pure play focus on homebuilding and financial services. So it's kind of a zero sum game. The asset base is still the same, it's just where the asset is going to fall, is going to fall balance sheet, AUM or liquidation, and all of its going to basically solve through the same equation.
Truman Patterson: Okay. And, for my follow-up question, you all I believe are guiding the low double digit community count growth in ‘22. Over the past four quarters, you've been starting about 4.5 to five homes per community per month. Are you pretty comfortable with this range going forward as you open more communities, just given all the constraints in the market? And, hypothetical internally, do you have the act of land and labor available to possibly move above that range if the material supply chain begins improving throughout 2022?
Stuart Miller: Let me invite Rick and then Jon to weigh in on this.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. So on the community count, I think, as I said in my remarks, we're really well-positioned right now. Why we'll dip a little bit in Q1, it's really just a timing issue. It's tough to map some of these things out over a 12 or 24-month timeframe. But we will see solid growth in the back-half of this year starting in Q2. And based on our land pipeline, we're pretty comfortable that we'll see continued growth in ‘23. As I said, we increased our overall owned and controlled pipeline land position by 44%, year-over-year. That's a lot of work from our teams. And all of that really increase came from option contracts. So it's remarkable repositioning and change in direction of the ship, all during a time period where we're really driving growth. I'll let Jon talk about start pace, because I think we're pretty comfortable.
Jon Jaffe: Yeah, we're very comfortable that we'll be able to look at ‘22 as an increase since starts over ‘21. So that some of that typical seasonality with Q2 being our strongest start quarter. But I think as we look across our platform, we are well-positioned with our relationship with our trade partners to be able to manage a very healthy start pace, and to the extent that we do see more stabilization relative to the supply chain.  I think what you'll see is a tightening of the cycle time more than the increasing start pace. And we're already planning on maintain a very disciplined approach to our start pace. What we'll pull in is the cycle time from the extended periods that we're seeing now.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. And good luck on the upcoming year.
Stuart Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question or questions. First, just on the gross margins, I think the guidance initially last night, maybe earlier this morning caught a some people off guard. With the first quarter down sequentially, certainly is it consistent though with your before ‘21, you had a consistent sequential decline.  I was hoping to delve into number one, if you could kind of break out perhaps what was the incremental negative headwind, in terms of lumber? I believe you mentioned that, you expect peak lumber costs in the first quarter versus just the reduced overhead leverage. And as you think about the full year guidance, I think, more importantly even what are some of the drivers there in terms of upside or downside. And the lumber costs assumption for the back half of the year.
Stuart Miller: So let me start by saying that our margins are very strong. When you look at the first quarter, you're basically looking at peak lumber, and you're getting to the edge of peak lumber, as we fall into the second quarter, where it really starts to moderate. And number two, you're really looking at leverage relative to field expenses. So, you see a little bit of a minor down in the first quarter, but our margins are still coming in at a very strong level. And you see that in our look forward to 2022. And, I’d just say that, like relative to looking ahead, it's always difficult to look at numerous quarters particularly in the market, where labor and materials and logistics are moving around. I think that we feel pretty optimistic about our margins as we go forward. And I think you see the beginnings of that reflected in our year-end or our total year 2022 projections, or forecast. Jon, you want to weigh in?
Jon Jaffe: I think you pretty much covered it. The peak pricing of lumber will hit us in Q1, and then we'll start benefiting from significantly lower prices. And, if you follow what's happening in lumber now, we'll probably see some uptick as we look at lumber purchases in the first, second, second quarters that will impact some the back-half of the year, but likely offset by what we spoke about in terms of very strong spring selling season, which should increase our ASP to offset that.
Mike Rehaut: Right. Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you for that. Secondly, if I could just a couple of clarifications on earlier questions. Number one around the share repurchase, it seems like you have a lot less wood to chop in terms of debt pay down this upcoming year, at the same time, presumably, you'd have a higher amount, equal to higher amount of cash flow. Everything else equal that that would point to potentially a greater amount of share repurchase in ‘22. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that right. And just lastly, on the Spin that it did sound like in an answer to Truman's question, you're kind of still expecting to offload about $5 billion to $6 billion of assets one way or another, if I heard you right?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So the answer to question one is, as I noted, we will continue to buy back stock on an opportunistic basis. I don't think there's any flaw in your thinking as to order of magnitude of cash flow, and how we're situated to be able to do that. I don't want to speak specifically about stock buybacks, I don't want to kind of lay out a roadmap, but we're going to do that opportunistically and we have significant cash flow as we look forward. As it relates to number two, the answer is yes, that's the answer that we gave. But basically laid out three buckets, it's either going to be balance sheet for SpinCo, AUM within SpinCo, or liquidation with cash flow enabling greater stock buyback, and that’s how we're focusing on it.
Mike Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much.
Stuart Miller: Okay, Mike.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Stephen Kim: Yeah, thanks a lot, guys, lots of good info here. I wanted to start by talking about the supply chain and your cycle times. So if we just did this ratio, we compared your fiscal ‘22 closings guide full year closings guide to what you actually did in this past fourth quarter. And we looked at that through time. And what we see is that your guide is assuming a ratio or a multiple of 4Q ‘21 closings, that's pretty consistent with previous years.  But given how unusual and crazy the supply chain was in 4Q, and your earlier comments that you think that it's going to start to get better. I'm kind of curious why you're not expecting that you could close more homes, relative to what you just did in the 4Q than in prior years? And then at a higher level, once your cycle times do stabilize or even contract, I'm curious how you're going to bounce orders relative to your production? Like, should we expect to see order growth reaccelerate, while your backlog turnover stays kind of low? Or, should we expect to see your turnover rates increase and your order growth continue to remain constrained for a while?
Stuart Miller: Jon, Rick.
Jon Jaffe: So, I think Steve, we've just taken a straight shot look at what we know today about our cycle times and projected production. As I said in my response to the prior question, if we do see the stabilization, I think what you'll see is a reduction in our cycle time versus our material pickup in our start pace. And if that does happen, we should lead to a pickup in closings. Relative to sale, this sort of comment, as Rick commented, we see a very strong sales environment. So to the extent that we change our start pace, not a closing pace, but our start pace, we would adjust our sales pace to match that. But as I said, I don't see a lot of upside in terms of increasing start pace. So I would think our sales would remain pretty consistent with the way that we planned them.
Stephen Kim: And then price will just be the thing that sort of equalizes that?
Jon Jaffe: Right. I just don't see any reason to sell ahead of how we're starting homes.
Stuart Miller: Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah, we could sell another 1,000 homes in the quarter if we wanted to without too much effort, it just doesn't make sense to do that. Jon and Stuart are exactly right. Does it make sense to get over skis, but we're good skiers, the market starts to improve a little bit. And the supply chain normalizes itself out, we'll close more homes. It's just the reality of the situation.
Stuart Miller: So Steve, let me just add to this and say, at the end of the day, the math would indicate just simple math would indicate that you're right. We've pushed some closings from 2021 into ‘22. We've increased starts through the year. And there should be higher closings and opportunities to sell kind of as we go forward. The choppiness of the supply chain really tells us to stay on the conservative side, until we see what the market actually does, and how things actually play out. So if you just sit down and look at the math, I understand your question, it's an excellent question. But if you look at the way the market is playing out, and how cycle times are moving, and the whack a mole kind of environment that we're in, we're just going to let it play out not get over our skis, as Rick says.
Stephen Kim: Yeah, makes perfect sense. And I believe you actually used a derivative of conservatism in your opening remarks. I think you said you conservatized some assumptions in your guidance. And so I wanted to pull on that thread a little bit that conservatism thread. Last year, your gross margin ultimately exceeded your initial guide by about 300 basis points. And despite the fact that there was this massive, unforeseen spike in lumber costs and scrambling costs from the supply chain and all that. And so, you've addressed the lumber a little bit in the fact that the first quarter is going to have a little bit of a headwind. I assume you meant by that, that the $4.18 increase is going to be bigger in the first quarter. I just want to confirm that maybe Diane, you can confirm that. But then the other big part of it is home price, right. So nationally, home prices look like they're still rising at about 1% a month, you just mentioned that you think a strong selling season is going to drive your ASP higher. But your ASP guide for the full year 2022 is actually below the order price that you booked this quarter. And I'm wondering if there's anything specific that is driving that or again, if it's just conservatism incorporated in your outlook?
Stuart Miller: Let me just say and I'm sorry, Rick, for stepping on you. But let me just say that we are a little bit shy about projecting too much ASP growth. And I think that, it's going to be interesting also to see what happens with interest rates, which I don't know how to factor in either right now. I kind of like, what we're looking at and what we're projecting, I feel pretty good about our ability to accomplish and maybe exceed some of those metrics. Rick, I stepped on you, I apologize.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. And I agree with exactly what Stuart said that there's a good feel in the market. As I walk through the markets, there's market strength in all product categories. We're seeing strength, it's all about getting the homes built, and reducing that cycle time. Sales price, we have good room in sales prices. Some of the ASP is a higher percentage of deliveries in the Texas markets, which are a little bit lower price markets. But we'll see how the year progresses.
Jon Jaffe: And Steve, answer to the first part of your question is yes, Q1 should be the peak lumber prices. And by the end of the quarter, we'll start to see them fall. But overall for the quarter, it'll be up from the fourth quarter.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys, good afternoon now. And thank you for taking the questions. First, I'd love to expand a little bit on that pricing conversation you just had with Steve. I totally understand the conservatism there not wanting to get too bullish, especially with the uncertainty on the rate environment. But, if I look at your ‘21 pricing a while you guys obviously grew prices at a very nice rate. And certainly, based on your margin, it looks like you took advantage of the strong pricing environment.  The growth was a little bit less than some of the other builders. And I'm curious if there's any -- when you look at your business on the pricing side, are there any actions you guys are taking, recognizing affordability constraints where you're trying to offset maybe apples-to-apples price gains with either building smaller square footage product, maybe moving out into some more affordable sub-markets as a way to keep your product more affordable? Or, am I reading too much into that and you'll tell me, no, it's just a mix of deliveries from quarter to quarter?
Stuart Miller: Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, it's a combination of all those things. As we move out to some other markets that are a little bit further out those are generally the lower priced compared to sort of the more infill style. We are adjusting and building a smaller footprint in many of our markets. And, Jon and I constantly balance with the team pace and price. And you'll continue to see good ASP growth.
Jon Jaffe: I think, also, as Rick mentioned earlier, I don't think it's a quarter-to-quarter mix as much as Rick and I and the divisions have been very focused on driving down the price curve as we deal with affordability. So we're consciously trying to produce product that is a smaller, more affordable, as well as a significant focus on picking up our market share in Texas, which does drive better ASP.
Alan Ratner: Perfect. Thanks for the color there, guys. Second question on the land strategy, the lot count. You guys highlighted the 40% plus growth in total lots controlled, and you're not necessarily unique in that standpoint. I think the public builders as a group are probably up 30%, 40% year-over-year, so clearly there's a huge push for tying up more land. And, on one hand, it's all tied up through option contracts, which is great, because it's obviously capital efficient.  But on the other hand, it doesn't seem like the markets going to be capable of delivering that type of growth anytime soon. So effectively, the way I look at the tail of your land supply is effectively continuing to grow, unless we could just see these huge bottlenecks resolved here over the next year or two. And, while it's off balance sheet, you still do have a billion dollars more of capital tied up in option deposits today than you had five or six quarters ago. So it's not completely asset free or capital free.  So I'm just curious, should we expect that growth to maybe start slowing here? Or, are you comfortable effectively growing that tail, because you want to have your kind of arms around all corners of the market for when the market does resolve itself from these constraints?
Stuart Miller: Look, I would say, Alan that on an overall for all homebuilders basis, the math and your questions probably hold water. And the positive side of that is, this market is not going to enable there to be a sizeable overbuilding, which has been an overhang in past cycles. On the other side, I think that if you look at our land strategy and programming, I think that the land market is definitely constrained. But I think that given our position in our strategic markets, we're just going to be able to outperform, and I think that we're really positioned to be able to do that. Rick, you want to weigh in on that?
Rick Beckwitt: We feel very comfortable with what we've done, feeling incredibly comfortable and pleased with the relationships that we've established across the U.S. with just some incredible land folks, regional developers. And that's what's really propelling this, it's given us an opportunity to get involved with some larger communities that are battleship communities that will have multiple price points and products going at various points in time, that have the ability to feed on themselves. I just really couldn't be more pleased with where we are right now.
Alan Ratner: All right. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Thank you. And let's make the next one the last question, please.
Operator: Absolutely. Our last question comes from Matthew Bouley from Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: They totally didn't answer that. Hey, sorry, that wasn't me. Thanks for squeezing me in here, and congrats on the quarter. So just a clarification around what's assumed in the guide related to supply chain. So you mentioned in the Q&A that you're embedding conservatism in the guide. But I think at the top, Stuart, you mentioned in the second-half that you do expect some I think you said mitigation in the supply chain disruptions.  Just curious, as we think about closings and community guide, kind of what degree of contingency is built into that guide? Or, is there an assumption within the guide that that supply chain does get better somewhat? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: So you're right. I did daylight that the second-half of the year, we expect to see some stabilization in the supply chain. And what we basically daylighted is that it's self-imposed stabilization, meaning we've increased the number of starts in order to be able to accommodate the fact that the cycle time has expanded, deliveries are somewhat impaired. I think the supply chain disruptions, I can't predict what's going to actually happen in the field.  But what we've done is we've put buffers out there in increased starts, our builder of choice program working with our subcontractor base or our building partner base, to activate kind of safeguards and programming to enable a better delivery system and logistics system. And additionally, our Everything's Included program, really reducing the number of skews in our product offering is working to our benefit and helps with our builder of choice program to really create embedded buffers that I think are going to really position us well in the second-half of the year. So, your question is what kind of conservatism have we injected. I think that we're kind of expecting more of a steady state program through the year. We're certainly not getting over our skis and expecting that everything will stabilize, and rise to the level of perfection as we get to the second-half. I can't give you a number in that regard. But conceptually, we've taken a conservative approach to looking to the remainder of the year. But we think that the market is going to stabilize that at least on the supply chain side.
Matthew Bouley: That's great color. Thank you for that, Stuart. And then last one on the gross margin guide, just to clarify the cadence here. Assuming, obviously the normal step down in Q1 with fixed field expenses. And simply looking at the math for getting to the full year guide, it's almost like assuming a normal levering of your fixed expenses as you go through the year without really much else that different is simply doing the math. So I'm just curious between you mentioned clearly lumber tailwinds emerging as you get to Q2, I'm wondering if there's any other pressures to the gross margin that we should be aware of. Rick, you just mentioned more mix to Texas, lower priced homes, for example, or perhaps the mix of delivering option lots. Just what other headwinds might be part of that gross margin guide? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Well, look, I think that you have a number of crosscurrents in just the cost side of the equation. Yes, lumber is moderating and we're going to bypass the first quarter’s peak. But at the same time, you have pressures from labor and materials in other areas that are clearly offsets to the benefit that we'll get from the lumber reduction. So, the cost side of the equation is moving around. We'll still have to see where ASP goes. And you're correct, that when you start to normalize our field expense and lumber starts coming down, there's somewhat of a gap in some of our numbers. But we're going to have to see how that gaps filled by the other traditional areas where costs are going up. Don't underestimate what's happening in labor. In a constrained labor market, you got to pay more. And sometimes to get things done, you got to pay a lot more. Same thing on logistics. So that's what's happening in the field right now. You can't predict it. All we can do is lay out our expectations. And that's what we've done.
Matthew Bouley: Great. Well, thanks. Good luck and happy holidays.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. So let's leave it there. Thank you, everyone for joining us. We look forward to reporting 2022 quarter by quarter. And we expect a very positive record breaking year from 2022. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-09-21 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.
Alexandra Lumpkin: Thank you, and good morning.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I'm here in Miami and I'm joined by our Co-President and CEO Jon Jaffe, and it happens to be his birthday today, as well. Happy Birthday, Jon. Diane Bessette is here, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from. And we have joining us also Richard Beckwitt, who's on the road, I believe in Dallas today. And Rick will be joining and contributing as well.  So listen, today's call is pretty straight forward. So we're going to try to keep our remarks relatively brief. So we have plenty of time for your questions. As usual, I'll give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick is going to talk about market strength, and land and community count. Jon will update on the [popular] supply chain, production, construction costs. And as usual, Diane will give a detailed financial highlight, the additional guidance, and then we'll answer as many questions as we can. And as usual, please limit to one question and one follow-up. So, let me begin and start on our singular low note. As you saw in our press release, we missed the low-end of our third quarter delivery guidance by 600 homes, delivering 15,199 homes. And while at Lennar, we are certainly not immune to supply chain disruption, we are simply not used to missing either. While our entire team feels the pain of this miss, it is not for lack of effort or focus that we missed but instead it's a reflection of the current market conditions. The supply chain for both land and construction is significantly stressed, and that will continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.  Accordingly, we expect our community count at the end of the year will be up only approximately 7% versus the 10% we previously guided and our deliveries will be approximately 18,000 versus the 19,000 to 21,000 we previously guided. And while we're not giving specific guidance for 2022, we fully expect double-digit growth in sales, starts, closings and community count next year. After my introductory remarks, Rick will further address the land and supply chain, and our performance and expectations. And Jon will give color on labor and materials and the effects on production. So except for the miss on deliveries, our third quarter results were very strong and quite extraordinary. Even with the supply chain constraint, we still grew our deliveries 10% year-over-year, while our revenues from home sales grew 19% to over $6.5 billion. And by remaining focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production, we drove a 420 basis point gross margin improvement from 23.1% last year to 27.3% this year. Alongside gross margin, we recorded a significant improvement in operating efficiency as our SG&A decreased 100 basis points to 7% this year versus 8% last year, and that's without the embedded leverage of the missed closings. Accordingly, our net margin increased 520 basis points year-over-year from 15.1% last year to a company all-time high 20.3% in our third quarter. This drove a 54% after tax and before extraordinary items bottom-line improvement and net earnings from approximately $667 million last year to over $1 billion this year. So with our focus on bottom-line over top-line improvement, 19% revenue growth drove 54% bottom-line growth. Our net new orders grew 5% year-over-year, even as we have matched our sales pace with production pace in this constrained environment and in spite of a difficult comparison to last year's strong recovery of fourth quarter numbers.  Additionally, our Financial Services Group continue to perform exceptionally, adding $112 million of earnings while supporting the orderly closing of our homes and making the closing process as joyful as possible in the current environment. With the strong performance of our core operating divisions, our balance sheet and returns continue to improve as well. Even after the purchase of 2.5 million shares of stock, and the reduction of $350 million of debt in the quarter, we reported a cash balance of over $2.6 billion and a 21.2% debt to total capital ratio, while our return on equity grew 800 basis points to 21.9%. All-in-all, our core operating numbers are very strong, and we expect this strength to continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.  Of course, in addition to our core, we have generated additional upside this quarter by some of our LENx investments which entered the public markets. While market conditions resulted in lower valuations for these companies by our quarter end, and those include Doma, Title, Hippo home insurance, Blend mortgage processing, and SmartRent automated entry systems, we still recorded just under $500 million of profit from those investments.  So even though we are guiding down our deliveries for the next quarter, we are decidedly guiding the prospects for Lennar’s continued success up as we continue to build on the core strategies that define our business and Diane will give more detailed guidance for the fourth quarter. But our expectations reflect overall strength in the market and optimism for our future.  From a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong and these continue to be the best of times. Demand has been consistently strong, while the supply of new and existing homes remains limited. Since new home construction cannot rent quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that persisted over the last decade, short supply is likely to remain for some time to come.  Even though home prices have moved much higher, the overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago and personal savings for deposits are strong. Wages for the average family seem to be rising faster than monthly payments. And while inflation numbers might seem to tell a different story, this is the story that we're hearing from our customers as they come to visit our field offices.  The primary driver of demand continues to be an upward spiral of housing consumer needs. Millennials are forming families. Apartment dwellers are purchasing first time homes. Yesterday's first time homes are selling at higher prices and anticipated -- and appreciated equity is enabling first time move ups. Yesterday's move up home is selling at strong pricing with increased equity, enabling customers to consider and purchase an even larger home. All this while supply is limited for everyone.  Additionally, the iBuyer and single family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace. The iBuyers are providing liquidity while becoming an essential convenience provider as the coordination of the closing of a new home is being complicated by supply chain disruptions. The convenience factor is becoming a real value proposition in and of itself. The single family for rent participants are also providing more liquidity while making a single family home lifestyle accessible to more families. Although higher home prices have exacerbated the well documented affordability crisis across the country, the solution is building more housing and making a growing portion of that housing stock available to more families to rent, if they can't yet meet the requirements for home ownership.  Professional ownership of homes enables renters to access a single family lifestyle while they build the credentials to own. Better housing for families produces better outcomes for families, and the industry is rewiring to provide those solutions.  As noted before, changes will also act as circuit breakers for the cyclicality in the housing market in the future. But for now, the housing market is very strong, and we the builders just have to get the homes built. Before I conclude, let me briefly talk about our spin company that I have too briefly described in the past. As you can see, from our balance sheet and cash flow, the case for SpinCo is becoming more and more compelling. We have adequate and even excess capacity to spin our well-established ancillary businesses. And those businesses and business lines do not meaningfully contribute to our core earnings in their current ownership configuration right now. In effect, these assets as currently positioned are actually dilutive to our growing returns on equity and returns on capital. With an effective spin, the remaining Lennar Corporation can drive higher returns on our assets and equity base, and we are pushing to make that happen. But as you would expect, we are determined to get it right and construct SpinCo as a standalone company that is investable, that is accountable, scalable and successful in its own right. The already successful business of SpinCo can and will be structured for success and accountability and form the beginning of a growth story that matches the success of Lennar. Accordingly, we have continued to work on the structure, components and organization of the new company. Time has continued to be our friend in that the Lennar core business, the Lennar cash flow and balance sheet have continued to improve and provide even greater opportunity and flexibility. Accordingly, I am once again to your disappointment, I'm sure, going to kick the can on delivering more detail on SpinCo. While nothing has changed in our expected execution and scope, the detail of standing up a new public company is time-consuming and complex, and we do not want to detail an incomplete picture or miss an opportunity to just get it right. To that end, this quarter, we engaged a new participant, Matt Zames, as a Senior Advisor to the company, focusing on the configuration and execution of our SpinCo strategy. Matt is a seasoned veteran in the financial services world as a past President of Cerberus Capital and as a past Chief Operating Officer of JPMorgan Chase. Matt's expertise in operations, execution and detailed financial modeling will help quickly advance the timeline for SpinCo and help bring it to market. Matt is not a newcomer to Lennar as we have worked with him through our very successful various advisory engagements with Cerberus and I personally serve with and format on the Board of Doma where Matt serves as an extraordinary Chair of the Board. In addition to when supporting Matt, we have sequestered a team of senior internal leaders under the focused leadership of Jeff McCall to work with Matt on the substance and structure of the new company. This team meets regularly to map the structure, model expected growth and review progress. We are standing up a new company backbone and the team includes all the leaders from the projected SpinCo verticals. As last -- as noted last quarter, our SpinCo will be configured as an independent and active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support our ongoing business verticals. As noted, 2 of these verticals already have raised third-party capital and are active asset managers. LMC, our multifamily platform has approximately $9 billion of gross capital under management and is raising its third fund right now. LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform currently manages approximately $1.25 billion of equity already raised. Both of these programs are neatly configured as independent self-sustaining operations. Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing independent land and land management business that has been refining -- that has been refined, and we have a growing technology investment business that, as you can see from our numbers, is performing exceptionally well under the name LENx. As I noted last quarter, this separation from the homebuilder will enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently.  So let me wrap up and conclude by saying that in spite of the miss of deliveries and the supply chain disruption that is affecting us and the industry, we have simply never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving housing market. Demand and the market in general remain very strong even as we return to traditional seasonality in our overall annual sales pace. While difficulties in the supply chain present challenges for Lennar in the industry, the housing market remains strong and supply of new and existing homes is very limited. And of course, given the supply chain challenges, the industry will not be able to quickly remedy the supply shortage with increased production. Accordingly, we expect the market to remain in its current balance or should I say, imbalance for an extended period of time. We remain focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We focus on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A, therefore, driving our net margin. We have built a just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end and we have built a just-in-time delivery system for our finished homes at the back end with our SFR single-family for rent program. We are focused on cash flow, on debt reduction and stock buyback and land-owned versus controlled, return on capital and return on equity and, of course, driving incremental upside from investments’ end and upside on our innovative technologies. We have an amazing group of talented associates driving our business forward and caring about the world around them at the same time. We are performing excellently on all metrics, driven by strategies that have worked to our benefit and the market condition remains extremely strong for this foreseeable future. As we begin to look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market and double-digit growth for Lennar. The story remains that supply is short and demand is strong. Some are concerned that demand is slowing as prices move higher and interest rates move, it feels to us that sales are slowing because many sales were made early and the industry is building through those sales slower than expected. We believe that home production has been constrained for a decade, and we are making up the deficit now, which should keep the housing market thriving for some time to come. With that, let me turn it over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this appreciated market with slightly longer cycle times caused by supply chain issues, we are strategically selling our homes later in the production cycle of the home to maximize prices and offset potential cost increases. Our third quarter results prove out the success of this strategy as we achieved gross margin increases of 420 basis points year-over-year and 120 basis points sequentially. During the third quarter, we started 4.9 homes per community, sold 4.5 homes per community, and we ended the quarter with less than 200 completed unsold homes across our entire footprint. This production, margin-driven and sales-focused program will continue to improve margin and lead to increased deliveries in fiscal 2022, given the ramp up in starts in the third quarter. In the third quarter, new orders, deliveries and gross margins were strong in each of our operating regions, with August being the strongest month in the quarter. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories, from entry level to move up to active adult. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 10% in the quarter, down 470 basis points from last year. In the third quarter, we continued to achieve price increases, although at a lower rate than earlier in the year. In general, the market has moderated from being extremely hot to a strong market that is returning to normal seasonal trends.  Here's some color on some of our stronger markets. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in-migration from the Northeast and the West Coast, which is being driven -- both -- which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited, and buyers are moving fast to close. The hottest markets in Florida continue to be Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest; Miami, Dade and Broward in the Southeast and Tampa. We are also seeing a strong recovery in Orlando with the increase in tourism. These markets -- these are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land positions. Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets benefited from -- benefiting from limited inventory, job growth and quality of living. We're the top builder in each of these markets. Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country with in-migration from the East and West. The state's pro-business employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and tremendous job growth, especially on the technology set. The state is also benefiting from the recovery in the oil and gas sector.  Notwithstanding out-migration from parts of California, the markets are strong in California. Driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and the East Bay area are the strongest markets. All are seeing migration from other California coastal markets due to a higher level of affordability compounded with the ability to buy a larger home for the money in those markets. Phoenix and Las Vegas continue to be strong markets. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in-migration from California. The casinos in Las Vegas are full and the city is benefiting from increased tourism. Phoenix is thriving due to real affordability. These are some of the strongest markets, but as I said, there is strength and depth of market across the country.  Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. While our community count is up slightly from the beginning of the year, we ended the quarter flat on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by a faster sales pace in certain existing communities which caused some communities to close out sooner than expected. Our community count was also impacted by delays in getting new communities open because of supply chain-type issues and municipalities being overwhelmed with short staff due to the Delta variant and not being able to process the entitlements, permitting and inspections on a timely basis.  Similar to the supply chain delays experienced by our homebuilding operations, the land issues are not caused by any operational failures, but instead by various external forces. The impacts of COVID from quarantine of sick workers to the necessary workplace modifications to ensure compliance with safety protocols had severely hampered many municipalities’ ability to timely process approvals and conduct inspections. Likewise, the active tropical basin this year caused not only site-specific land development delays but added to the logistical supply chain channels that already existed, primarily associated with PVC, drainage structures and valves. The snowball effect of these delays combined with the shortage of crews due to COVID quarantines, really slowed down the process. While these challenges persist, we are proactively managing these challenges. With all this in mind, we now expect to end the year with a 7% increase in community count versus the 10% we targeted at the beginning of the year. While we are disappointed with these delays, we know this is just a timing thing and that these communities will come online. On a more positive note, our land pipeline remains robust with plenty of land in the queue to meet our growth goals over the next several years. We continue to see good buying opportunities in all of our markets, and are confident this pipeline will produce strong community count growth for the next several years as we pursue deals to backfill beyond the near-term deals that are already owned or controlled. We're also pleased with the excellent progress we're making on our land light strategy, as evidenced by our years owned supply of homesites improving to 3.3 years at the end of the third quarter from 3.8 years at last year's third quarter and our controlled homesite percentage increasing to 53% from 35% for the same periods. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their tireless efforts as we've worked through these challenges associated with the supply chain.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. I will now briefly address how we are managing through the supply chain disruptions that are impacting Lennar and the industry, and we'll answer any detailed questions you have in the Q&A. As Stuart noted, our closing miss for Q3 was driven by supply chain disruptions that led to a general increase in our cycle time to build homes, but also some intermittent shortages that stalled production beyond cycle time, causing these closings to be delayed into our fourth quarter. As you've heard from various building product companies, and from other homebuilders, disruptions are affecting different trades at different times and in different geographies. They are intermittent, and they are not over yet. In many ways, it's truly a game of whack-a-mole, creating a traffic jam. Like cars, the construction process is backed up, creating a chain reaction of delays that cascades from 1 trade to the next. The team at Lennar is aptly dealing with this situation to manage for the best possible outcomes. Like the rest of the industry, we not only saw our cycle time increase approximately 2 weeks in our third quarter, but we also had additional surprises that quickly changed delivery dates. Fortunately, at Lennar, we have extraordinary supply chain, purchasing and construction teams that are very coordinated and are managing our scheduling on a day-by-day basis in partnership with each of our trade partners. We work with our partners to solve issues in real time as well as planning ahead for our future demand needs. Our decades-long platform of Everything’s Included has minimized the impact of supply chain shortages as we have fewer SKUs to manage and we can plan out material needs far in advance. This has become more important than ever as lead times have materially expanded for most manufacturers. Additionally, we're now in our sixth year of focusing on being the Builder of Choice for our trade partners. Over this time span, we have rewired interactions with our building partners to help them manage their cost inputs, reduce their labor needs and enable them to grow. This has earned us a seat at the table with our strategic trade partners in these stressful times to work through solutions partner by partner. Even where the solution is bringing in alternative manufacturers, this is done in a collaborative manner with our existing partners to help them versus hurt them. We are doing a better job than ever at a time when it was most needed in communicating with our trade partners and giving them detailed forecasting information. Let me give you a quick sense of where the greatest impacts are being felt right now. From a national manufacturing perspective, the categories most impacted are engineered wood, windows, garage doors, paint and vinyl siding. On a regional basis, it is brick and lumber capacity in Texas, concrete block in Central Florida, insulation in North and Southwest Florida and in Phoenix and Minnesota it's severe labor constraints. We believe we'll feel the effects of this backup for the next few quarters. And then based on the plans we have in place with all of our trade partners, we would expect to see stabilization in our cycle times by Q2 of 2022. As mentioned in our quote, we remain focused on consistently increasing our start pace. And in the third quarter, we averaged 4.9 homes per community, up from 4.2 homes per community last year or 17,630 homes started in the third quarter, up 16% from last year. This positions us well for growth in 2022. And as discussed earlier, we are in regular communication with our entire supply chain in advance of these starts in order to support this increase in activity. The construction cost impact in our third quarter closings were primarily from the lumber increases taken earlier in the year that are now impacting costs as homes close. In the third quarter, costs were up $5.40 per square foot over the third quarter last year, and lumber accounted for about 95% of that increase. We will see increased costs from lumber, although at lower level in Q4 and Q1, with lumber cost reductions thereafter. In various other product categories, cost increases have been pushed in the second and third quarters as a result of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. These increases will flow through closing starting Q1 of 2022 but will be offset by the reduction in lumber costs, resulting in a net reduction in costs by Q2. As we have noted in prior quarters, our revenues are growing at a faster pace than construction cost increases, resulting in a decrease in construction cost as a percent of revenues to 41.4% compared to 43.6% last year. Overall, the Lennar management team is focused daily on managing through the current supply chain disruptions. It is a truly all hands on deck. Stuart, Rick, our regional presidents and myself, support Kemp Gillis and our supply chain team by joining them in meetings with the leadership of key trade partners. In these meetings, we listen and learn, understand the challenges and then craft solutions. We review production needs for the weeks and months ahead, implement our solutions and then execute as partners. This pattern of execution, combined with maintaining our disciplines of Everything’s Included and Builder of Choice platforms with an additional focus on further SKU reductions and enhanced communications, allows us to be nimble in responding to and managing through this environment. As we look ahead, there are bumpy parts of the road and a traffic jam or two to work through. Both increased starts and much appreciated cooperation from our trade partners, we are setting up for solid growth in deliveries in 2022.  Thank you. And I'll now turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. So Stuart, Rick and Jon have provided a great deal of color regarding our homebuilding performance. So therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes on the results of our other business segments and our balance sheet and then provide detailed guidance for Q4 of 2021. So starting with Financial Services. For the third quarter, our Financial Services team reported $112 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings decreased to $80 million compared to $113 million in the prior year. As we've indicated for several quarters, the mortgage market has become more competitive with purchase business as refi volumes have declined. As a result, secondary margins have been decreasing. Our third quarter was negatively impacted by lower secondary margins compared to the prior year and was the primary driver for the decrease in mortgage operating earnings.  Title operating earnings increased to $26 million compared to $21 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to the growth in both volume and profit per transaction. Our Title team has been laser-focused on technology, automation and efficiencies with the goal of driving higher productivity.  So then turning to our Lennar Other segment. For the third quarter, our Lennar Other segment had operating earnings of $492 million. The driver of the earnings was LENx, which is our growing technology investment business. Three of our LENx investments, Hippo, SmartRent and Blend went public, as Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, and we recognized mark-to-market gains of $433 million on these investments. We also had mark-to-market gains of $61 million on our existing public investments, Opendoor and Sunnova. And as a side note, we do have an investment in Doma Holdings, which also went public in the third quarter. However, we do not utilize mark-to-market accounting for this investment, primarily because of our level of ownership. If we have marked the investment to market, the unrealized gain would have been $638 million. Again, this does not appear in our P&L or balance sheet, just a noteworthy point.  So you can see that LENx continues to, first and foremost, add value to our core homebuilding operations but also provides potential upside with investment earnings. Now turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash, and this is after deploying almost $600 million to retire debt early and buy back stock, which I'll discuss in a minute. We had no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to execute on our strategy to become asset lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and home, generating significant homebuilding cash flow and improving returns. At quarter end, we owned 190,000 homesites and controlled 216,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.3 years from 3.8 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled percentage increasing to 53% from 35% in the prior year. All this progress resulted in achieving a 23% return on inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, and is consistent with our intense focus on increasing all returns. During the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $78 million, and we repurchased 2.5 million shares totaling $246 million. This brings our year-to-date repurchase amount to 4 million shares totaling $388 million. We also retired early our $300 million 6.25 senior notes that were due in December 2021, further reducing our debt balance and saving about $9 million in interest as we utilize the 6-month par call feature. Our next maturity, $600 million due in January 2022 as a 3-month par call, which we will also utilize to prepay the notes next month. This will leave us with no senior note maturities until October 2022. Additionally, during the quarter, we also paid off $50 million of other nonpublic homebuilding debt. So when you pull all this together, at quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total capital was 21.2%, down from 29.5% in the prior year. And then a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $21 billion from $17 billion in the prior year, and our book value per share increased to 66.73 from 54.91 in the prior year. Our return on equity was 22% compared to 14% a year ago. And finally, in June, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P and are now investment grade with all 3 rating agencies. We are extremely proud of the status with the agencies and believe it reflects the successful execution of our operating strategy as well as our very strong balance sheet. And so with that brief overview, let me turn to guidance for the fourth quarter, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q4 new orders to be in the range of 15,200 to 15,400 homes as we return to more seasonal patterns. And we expect our deliveries, as we've said, to be about 18,000. Now this estimate has some plus or minus to it because the supply chain challenges bring a great deal of uncertainty. But the final number of homes delivered will be dependent on outcomes due to the same issues, which, of course, we are navigating each and every day. Our Q4 average sales price should be about 445,000 as we continue to see price appreciation. We expect our gross margin to be about 28% and we expect our SG&A to be about 6.7%. However, once again, these amounts will move up or down a bit depending on the number of homes delivered. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q4 loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million.  Then turning to our other business segments. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q4 will be in the range of $95 million to $105 million as market competition for purchased business continues. We expect our multifamily operations to be about breakeven. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect earnings in the range of $5 million to $10 million. This guidance does not include any potential adjustments to our mark-to-market investments, since this will be determined by their stock price at the end of our quarter. We expect Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.2% of total revenue and our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.8% and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 306 million shares. And so when you put all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $4.12 to [$4.16] per share for the fourth quarter. And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategies, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned to have a strong end to our fiscal 2021. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI.
Stephen Kim: Appreciate all the detail. I want to talk about the homebuilding business specifically. Stuart, 3 months ago, we talked about how it might be more accurate to describe the move in home prices that the industry and you have seen over the past year as a correction upward, since home prices rose in order to reduce demand down to the depressed level of supply, there was a gap between supply and demand. And so this quarter, you've talked about in your opening remarks, about demand as being at a more normal seasonal level. But it's also fair to say that supply constraints have worsened too. So basically, at this point, what I'm asking is, would you say that demand is still above supply and then home prices are still generally rising? And more specifically, maybe how did demand respond to pricing actions you took over the summer? And how would you say things are trending thus far in September?
Stuart Miller: So interesting question, Steve. Look, you do have these kind of cross currents. I would clearly say that demand is above supply. And therein, you see pricing power. But at the same time, the kind of conflict that you're daylighting is that if you think about the sales pattern of last year, it stalled in and around COVID and then picked up very sharply as you went into the third and fourth quarters. And so your comparisons are relative to a kind of catch-up that was embedded in sales numbers back at that time. So yes, you actually still have very strong demand. You have very strong sales. You're not catching up anymore. And because you have short supply and a delivery system or a production system that is slowed by the supply chain, that demand is clearly outstripping supply. You still see pricing power. But comparisons are kind of tepid in terms of seeing sales growth because nobody wants to get way out ahead of what they can actually produce. When you ask about pricing over the past -- over the summertime, and how has that moderated sales, and that's exactly what you're seeing in our numbers is pricing power, pricing pulling back on sales a little bit and keeping our sales in check with the actual production abilities that are out there. Is that helpful?
Stephen Kim: Yes, absolutely. Yes, I think it's important to call out as you did the unusual seasonality last year. Yes. Then of course, at some point, the market is going to start focusing more on 2022 and beyond. And so I wanted to -- my next question sort of gets to that. Jon, you gave some good numbers. I think you said $5.40 per square foot in terms of cost, with lumber being 95% of that increase. And you've laid out an expectation that by 2Q of next year, the decline in lumber cost will be greater than other inflationary forces that you see in your cost structure, which I assume is a fancy way of saying that margins -- gross margins could trend upwards. I wanted to make sure that I didn't oversimplify and that, that is actually what you were trying to convey. And then as a follow-on to that, I would ask generally maybe for Stuart, the outlook for gross margins is one of the major areas of disagreement in -- for The Street for next year. And I was curious, my view is that a return to sort of normal season outlook, what you talked about in no way suggests that margins are going to quickly return back to some sort of historical norm in part because home prices have already reached a new level and land costs are embedded in your balance sheet already at a lower cost. I was wondering if you could help us understand how you think about how margins may trend over the next few years if supply and demand starts to come more into balance, are we going to see margins quickly return? Or would we likely see some hang time here on the gross margins?
Jon Jaffe: Steve, relative to your first follow-up. You heard me quite accurately. Lumber is down about 70% from its peak. The starts that we're seeing in September are incorporating at lower price, and that's what I say, by Q2, we'll see the benefit of that. And again, you accurately heard me that we expect that, that benefit will be greater than the cost increases in other categories combined, resulting in a lower cost per square foot on the homes that we build that we'll be delivering starting in Q2.
Stuart Miller: Look, I think that as you asked the question about margin. To think out 2, 3, 5 years, that's too hard of a projection to make. But as we're looking ahead to 2022, we certainly see margin strength. You're probably noting that while labor and materials are going up in some respects, the big ticket item, lumber is coming down and has come down. And those numbers are only starting to flow through in sequence the production cycle that exists. So you do have somewhat of margin protection. As we think ahead to 2022, we think our margins are going to continue to be quite strong. Rick, do you want to weigh in on that?
Rick Beckwitt: No, I think you guys have covered it pretty well. We're seeing nothing that would reflect a downward adjustment in margins. We're underwriting land deals with the same intensity. We're fortunate because we've got all our land in shape for 2022 and almost everything for 2023. And we've just got tremendous visibility in what that pipeline is. So we feel pretty good about where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research.
Truman Patterson: Good morning, everyone, and happy birthday, Jon. I couldn't think of a better way to spin it than on a conference call. So I do apologize. I did get disconnected during the opening comments from the call. So if I double up on anything that was said, I apologize. But you all were able to increase starts 16% year-over-year. You're mentioning some fairly significant supply chain issues. Question is on materials availability and just discussions with your vendors. Do you think they'll actually have enough capacity to support a double-digit growth rate in '22? Our hope is the manufacturers will be able to improve inventory during the seasonally slower winter months. But we really haven't seen any evidence yet. Just trying to get your take on how the next year unfolds. And I believe in your prepared remarks, you said you're expecting these constraints to ease by the second quarter. Just wanting to understand your thoughts there.
Jon Jaffe : Yes, that's right, Truman. What we're seeing is there still is a constraint on the supply chain that feeds our manufacturers, our supply chain. And that's not over yet, as I mentioned. But lead times have expanded, which is giving some breathing room to these manufacturers to start to catch up. And that's what I meant by the plans we have in place, manufacturer by manufacturer, trade partner by trade partner give us some visibility, although not perfectly clear that as we get into Q2 of next year that we expect that cycle times will stabilize. We feel very confident that -- as I mentioned, that the plans we have in place will support our double-digit growth that we have planned. It's not all of a sudden growth change for us. It's very methodical. As Stuart and Rick both mentioned, we carefully match our production pace, our sales pace. And so this is all planned outweigh in advance with real good visibility for our trade partners to support us.
Stuart Miller: Let me just add to that, Truman, I don't think that we can stress enough how hands on this program has been and will continue to be. In fact, Jon and Rick are jointly going to go out and meet with various strategic partners, trade partners, one-on-one in their offices over the next months. And that's very much by way of making sure that what we're saying is what we bring to market. We don't like missing. We don't like setting expectations that are not achievable. We've done a lot of homework to think about where we are and what we can achieve. We daylighted the fourth quarter. There's still some volatility in that, but we're developing more and more certainty as we get out ahead with proper preparation with our Everything's Included program limiting SKUs, with our Builder of Choice program, maximizing affinity and focusing on making sure that we're in lockstep with our trade partners.
Jon Jaffe : And just emphasize the point, as Stuart said, of our Everything's Included program, where manufacturer lead times have expanded anywhere from 4x to 7x their normal lead times, the ability to know what we're going to build way in advance as compared to a design studio program really gives us the ability to communicate very effectively with those manufacturers and adjust to their lead times.
Truman Patterson: And then community count, you walked down modestly, but it's still growing 7% by year-end. With permits and entitlements becoming more delayed, how are you viewing your community count going into '22? And then also just big picture, I'm trying to understand how, you all view some of your private competitors? We've been hearing that they're fairly land constrained. Do you think they're going to remain land and community count constrained? Or will we start to see a normalization or a catch-up in inventory in 2022, trying to understand some of the market share dynamic potential as well?
Rick Beckwitt: So I'll take that. I think you're going to continue to see the smaller and the regional builders have a difficult time to get community count up. The overall industry in the market is shifting to really have the land market address the top builders. And we have such a market share advantage that the developers want us in their deals. So that's number one.  Number two, as I mentioned in my remark -- in my comments, we're anticipating double-digit community count growth in 2022. We've got the land in place, permitting and planning and plan approved and all those entitlement things are problematic, but we're going to make our way through that, and we've got good visibility. This whole supply chain disruption thing has given us the ability to do triage on how we deal with some of the talents. And we're getting to a point where we can help them, help us in a more efficient way. So it's working, and we feel pretty confident that's what we're going to do.
Stuart Miller: Truman, let me just add to that and say, Rick said something that was somewhat nuanced in his comments, but very important, and that is we have plenty of land. It's converting land to community count that has kind of slowed down a little bit right now. So we have tremendous visibility given our land acquisition, our land engagement machine that's out in the markets where we really do have a tremendous advantage over those smaller, more regional builders in accessing land. But it's in finalizing entitlements and actually getting communities open where you see some of the stickiness. Rick daylighted that it's with final approvals or final plats or actually the land development where you might have PVC shortage or things like that, that impair your ability to actually get it into the community count and open to business. So I think that we have pretty good visibility on where we're going -- not pretty good, excellent visibility on where we're going. It's just about some of the impairments that exist at the local level in the field, and we're working through that.
Operator: Next, we will hear from Carl Reichardt with BTIG.
Carl Reichardt: I -- Stuart, I keep trying to catch the can, you keep kicking, but I won't ask about that. More on the supply chain, right? It's the mess. And I'm trying to figure out, Jon, you called for a stabilization, I think, in build times in 2Q '22. What are the critical early signs we should be looking for to tell us that we’re on the path to normalization? Is it a product availability type or a process normalization? And then in the long run, how does the current environment impact strategies or tactics you or the industry might use to get more control over the supply chain in the future?
Jon Jaffe: So relative to signs to look for in stabilization, as I mentioned, we're in day-to-day coordination in conversation with our key manufacturers and our key trade partners. And it's really about the planning process to look at the weeks, months and quarters ahead so that they can plan their productivity to match what we're doing. And also, as I mentioned, to bring in additional trade partners to help support those partners of ours that are not able to ramp up to the needs that we have. And that, again, is very closely coordinated to make sure that we can get enough volume out of them.
Stuart Miller: But Carl, if you're looking for a signal that you can kind of watch and wait for, I don't think you're going to see it until we tell you that it's happening. It's going to flow through our numbers, and we're going to see it before others see it. And you're going to -- you're just not going to be able to see the stabilization until it's actually happening. That's kind of my view of it.
Jon Jaffe: That's exactly right. As we work through this planning process, it will be the outcome of that, that will show up and be visible.
Carl Reichardt: Okay, Stuart. Challenge accepted then. The next question I had is on single-family build rent. What percentage of your deliveries are going to non-owner occupants now, whether it's sales of homes to institutions or mom and pop operators? And then Rick, you talked about the land opportunities you still see, good ones out there. Are you concerned that some of the well-funded sort of start-up build-to-rent operators who are beginning to look for land transactions and have very different pro formas than a traditional builder might, that what they're willing to pay, their more aggressive approach has an impact on land availability long term for you all?
Rick Beckwitt: So let me just start there and say we don't have -- we haven't separated out numbers on what percentage are going to final users versus some of the -- what some might say are the nontraditional users. Many -- in many markets, the single-family for rent buyers are just an ordinary part of the market and have been a regular participant. So we just haven't separated out those numbers. But it is an active and important part of where the market is going, enabling people who can't necessarily get the down-payment currently, get them into a single-family lifestyle, which I think is a greater good.
Stuart Miller: So maybe I'll address the second component of your second question, which was -- had to do with the competitiveness of the other SFR players. As Jon and I have been looking at this, and we're very close to the market, we're seeing relatively little competition associated with these deals. As I said, the developers want execution. And they are very focused on making sure that people close on the land, work through the land because in many cases, they're leveraged. And as a result, they want to make sure that they've got the cash flow to keep their businesses up. These other players don't have the cost structures that we have. So from a cost standpoint, we build so much cheaper than they will ever have the capacity to build. So it's difficult for us to feel that they pose any competitive threat in disrupting the landmark.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman.
Alan Ratner: So first question, you guys obviously went into a lot of detail on the material challenges you guys are facing. Curious on your start pace for the quarter. You’re obviously up a lot year-over-year, but your starts were down about 2,000 homes sequentially. So I'm curious what went into that? Is that a function of more labor tightness on the front end? Or was that more by design to prevent some of those later-stage material challenges from getting even worse?
Jon Jaffe: I think the real answer to that is in the normal planning process of the cyclicality of the year, the seasonality of the year, more correctly. So we typically will have more starts in our second quarter that feed into our largest delivery quarter, the fourth quarter. And then third quarter starts are feeding into the beginning of the year. So that's more of a normal pattern.
Alan Ratner: Got it. So the thought process that demand is so far outstripping supply, that wouldn't negate any type of normal seasonality going forward from a start perspective, like you're not going to be trying to accelerate that or move against seasonality given the view that demand is so sharply outstripping supply?
Jon Jaffe: Well, I think that we closed the gap on that because as we said that the demand is stronger than supply, and we see that in the next few quarters. So as I said, we're up 16% year-over-year in our third quarter starts, which I think demonstrates our bullishness on starting more homes.
Alan Ratner: Got it. Okay. I appreciate that, Jon. Second question, I would love to circle back to that question earlier on margin and land underwriting. And I think, Rick, you made a comment towards the end of that, that you're still underwriting your land deals with the same intensity. Would love to dig into that comment a little bit more. Does that mean when you look at the underwriting on deals today, recognizing it might take a couple of years for those land deals to flow through, that it implies a gross margin in the 28% range that you guys are delivering today?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, I'm not going to take the bait on 2 or 3 years out and Stuart decided not to answer that 1 as well. But I think that as we look at near term and we underwrite pricing and cost structures, we're underwriting to very similar margins as to what we've got now.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matthew Bouley with Barclays.
Matthew Bouley: Just following up on the production capacity, if I'm doing the math right around your starts, I think year-to-date, maybe it was about 5 per community, obviously, 4.9% in the latest quarter. You're talking to communities increasing double digits next year. So my question is, if 5 -- is that an achievable run rate for production as you look out to '22 because mathematically, that would put you close to perhaps 80,000 homes produced? Or do you really need kind of an easing in supply chain to make a number like that realistic?
Stuart Miller: We definitely need an even supply chain, and it's going to be volatile, at least in the beginning of the year. We'll see how it evolves through the year. But look, we were appropriately anticipatory as we put starts in the ground early on early in the year. We've ramped up our starts in order to have production that could meet what we thought would be long-term demand trends. And that's going to enable us. You're right. If you do simple math, you can get to some interesting numbers for 2022. But I think that we're going to see how the supply chain actually evens itself out, what cycle times actually become as you go through a year like next year. And there's going to be an early year rippled from the supply chain disruption or complexity that exists right now. So we're not really giving guidance for next year. We did daylight that we see strength in the market that will reflect itself in double-digit growth in our significant kind of metrics, and we're going to leave it at that for right now. As we get to the fourth quarter and in the fourth quarter, we'll give guidance for the following year. But it will be based on a better understanding and a better belief system of not only what's in the pipeline, but also what the supply chain is really shaping up to look like -- I daylighted that Jon and Rick together are going out and meeting with a number of our trade partners one-on-one in their facilities, we found those meetings to be very telling and helpful and kind of mapping out what we can expect. And so it will be interesting to see how our update goes in the fourth quarter.
Matthew Bouley: Great. Stuart. Second one, just on the regions and looking at the sales pace, I couldn't help but notice that in the East, your sales pace was actually up sequentially in the quarter there. So I'm just curious, I know you gave some great commentary at the top around demand strength in Florida. But just speaking about production again, what was different about the East overall that allowed you to continue to keep sales pace over 5? Is production just easier to come by there? Or what's different there about the rest of your markets?
Stuart Miller: Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, some of the East, particularly -- I think we have Florida in the East. Is that correct? Because I look at it from the way we run our company regionally. Really hasn't faced as many of the issues associated with framing. We -- a lot of concrete block construction in Florida. We dominate the Florida markets and really have a good control of the trade base there. So that's one of the drivers of that.
Stuart Miller: All right. Why don't we take 1 more question?
Operator: Our last question will come from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs.
Susan Maklari: My first question is just -- we talked a little bit about the land market. But can you give us more sense of as you're kind of targeting more of this option versus owned strategy, exactly how that's coming together and how we should be thinking about it for next year?
Stuart Miller: Well, we've daylighted for a number of quarters now. And I think that we've executed very much in line with what we've laid out. And that is that we're very focused on migrating to a higher option versus owned program. And we've worked and focused on building kind of an institutional model for making that happen. We've talked about the land program that we have in place where we really have quite a structured program for land optioning and that's working extremely well. And that program is enabling us to make this migration in orderly course quarter-by-quarter. We are improving the number of lots that are actually -- or homesites that are actually positioned in an optioned program. And I think that you'll see more and more over time that we're really developing a quite structured just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end with much less land that will be held on our books but much more land that is controlled for our future.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up is, you've obviously made a lot of progress on the SG&A side. You took the guidance to 6.7% for the fourth quarter. Can you talk about the incremental initiatives that you're seeing coming together there? And what else is left that we should be thinking about as we look forward?
Stuart Miller: So, Susan, thank you for bringing up our SG&A. I think we all feel we've got a bounce in our step because we think that this is one of the most important parts of how our company has focused 5 basis points and 10 basis points at a time on improving the underlying model that will define our way future. Our net margin continues to grow. And there aren't big items that we can point to in controlling SG&A. It's just a lot of small initiatives across our business, all the way from the internal plumbing system of our IT group and the way that we're compiling numbers and putting -- getting to quarter end literally within days, closing our books within days after the close of quarter and bring our numbers and projections to light digitally and automatically as opposed to with an awful lot of work from our people in the field, the efficiencies that we're injecting in every part of our business all the way from marketing to realtor commissions, to the way that our construction operations are actually run. Every element of our business is being reworked and replumbed for efficiency, and it's reflecting quarter after quarter after quarter in our SG&A.  So we think it's one of the most important things. We don't get enough questions about it. But it really is every quarter incremental improvement. And we have some divisions that have just taken it to new levels. And I think that we're just -- we're still at the -- in the early innings of doing what we can accomplish in the future.
Susan Maklari: That’s very helpful. Thank you and good luck with everything. 
Stuart Miller: Okay. Good. Thanks for the question. And again, everyone, thank you for joining us today. We look forward to reporting again in the fourth quarter. And I think in the fourth quarter, we'll be able to give a little bit more color on where the supply chain is shaping out and look forward to reporting on that. So thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-06-17 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.  I will now turn the call over to Alex Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.
Alexandra Lumpkin: Thank you, and good morning. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Lennar's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in yesterday's press release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption Risk Factors contained in Lennar's annual report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, and thank you, everyone. So this morning, I'm here in Miami with Rick Beckwitt and Jon Jaffe, our Co-CEOs and Co-Presidents; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller and Vice President; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from. It's been a while since we've done an earnings call together, altogether, but we're all here and happy to be returning to normal. So, today's call is pretty straightforward, so we'll try to keep our remarks as brief as possible and leave time for your questions. I'm going to give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick will talk about market strength, community count, and our growing single-family for rent strategy. And Jon will update our just-in-time land strategy, supply chain, production, and construction costs. As usual, Diane will give detailed financial information, highlights, and guidance, and then we'll attempt to answer as many questions as possible. Please limit questions to just one question per customer and one follow-up. So with that, let me start and I want to start my remarks today with a big shout-out to the entire Lennar operating team. There is simply no way to report our quarterly results without starting with the engine that produces those results. The market conditions have made these the best of times in the housing market. These times have their challenges as well. Performing in this best of times is hard grinding work that requires the coordination of a first-class, hands-on, and engaged management team working in close partnership with extraordinary associates who care deeply about our customers and our company and leave nothing on the field in achieving those results. I'd also like to give a [indiscernible] shout out to one person, in particular, and that is our Chief Operating Officer, Fred Rothman. It is noteworthy that Fred is not with us here in the room today. This is because he's probably out in one of our divisions, listening with the management team there. He's connecting the dots between their performance and the performance of the company, and the articulated strategies of the company. Key is with the people. Recently, we had a Fortune magazine article written about the company. Fred wasn't pictured nor interviewed because he was busy out with the people that make things happen. In fact, Fred is the every person of Lennar, not pictured, not interviewed, no limelight, no fanfare, just heads down doing the work that makes this company great. Thank you, Fred. You make us proud. The associates of Lennar from homebuilding to financial services to LENx to the outer reaches of our ancillary business segments, perform the impossible on a regular basis. They care for all of our core constituents, our customers, our shareholders, our building partners, and our community as well as caring for each other. The harmony and camaraderie at Lennar is in itself a real source of pride, and it drives us all to excellence in our business to innovation to stay at the cutting edge, to integrity in everything we do, to shared prosperity across our communities with our money and our time in coordination with our Lennar Foundation. I know I joined everyone in this room today in saying a big thank you to our associates and telling our shareholders, bondholders, analysts, and investors that we, here in this room, are proud to have the privilege to present their results to you today. Now, as I've already noted from a macro perspective, the housing market remains very strong as these are the best of times. Demand has continued to strengthen while the supply of new and existing homes has remained constrained. New home construction cannot ramp quickly enough to fill the void of the production deficit that has persisted over the past decade. And while some question whether that deficit is 1 million homes or 5.5 million homes, the bottom line is that supply is short. Land, labor, and supply chain are all limiting factors in the drive to meet current demand. So, supply is short and is likely to remain that way for some time to come. Even though home prices have moved much higher and interest rates have moved slightly higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago, and personal savings for deposits are strong. Wages seem to be rising faster than monthly payments. Millennials are moving out of their parents' homes and forming families. Apartment dwellers are finding a first-time home, and demand is strong and growing. Yesterday's first-time homes are selling at higher prices, and that equity is enabling first-time move-ups. Yesterday's move-up home is selling at a strong price and with increased equity enabling customers to consider and purchase a larger home. The upward spiral of a strong housing market is in full swing. Additionally, the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace to purchase and sell homes as they evolve and provide ever more frictionless transactions. They are also solving important industry problems that have needed solutions for a very long time. The iBuyers, led by Opendoor, are becoming more than just a home sale option. They are an ever more effective and instrumental convenience provider as the coordination of the closing of a new home is being complicated by supply chain disruptions. Expected closing dates move and the customer -- and customer plans are disrupted. The fragile dance of selling an old home, while closing on a new home becomes frustrated by these delays. Opendoor and other iBuyers have developed flexibility programs that are designed to bridge that gap and simplify unpredictable delays. The iBuyer value proposition is more compelling than just a ready and convenient homebuyer. It is becoming the core of a coordinated closing without double moves or double housing costs. The convenience factor is becoming a real value proposition in and of itself. The single-family for rent participants are making a single-family home lifestyle accessible to more families, to working families. Although higher home prices have exacerbated the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, the solution is to build more homes and make a growing portion of that housing stock available to -- for more families to rent if they can't meet the requirements for homeownership. This is simply a social equity program that enables better housing for more families and more diverse families without weakening the mortgage market. Professional ownership of homes enables renters to access a single-family lifestyle while they build the credentials to own, and while commercial and professional owners manage the risk profile. Better housing for families produces better outcomes for families, and the industry is rewiring to make better housing accessible and affordable to more families. Rick will cover this in more detail shortly. The housing market is not only very strong, but it is also going through some very interesting structural changes that will promote stability in the market and extend housing benefits to the breadth of a diverse society. The iBuyer space promotes liquidity, frictionless transactions and enables mobility, while professionally owned single-family for rent is providing workforce housing with social equity and upward mobility that has never existed before. These changes will also act as circuit breakers for the cyclicality of the housing market in the future. But for now, the housing market is strong while it is evolving in some very constructive ways. So in the context, a very strong overall market condition, Lennar's very strong second quarter results reflect a lot of hard work and a consistent and focused strategic plan. We remain focused on orderly targeted growth with our sales pace tightly matched with our pace of production. We have limited growth at the top line while in favor of an even greater growth at the bottom line. We focused on gross margin by selling in step with production while controlling costs and reducing our SG&A. We have built a just-in-time delivery system for land at the front end, and we have built a just-in-time delivery system for our finished homes at the back end with our single-family for rent program.  We are focused on cash flow; debt reduction and stock buyback; land owned versus controlled; return on capital and return on equity; and of course, on innovative technologies. And we've carefully managed an already stressed supply chain by maintaining our delivery targets for the year rather than increasing them while we focus on delivering high-quality homes to our customers. All of this strategic focus shows through in our second quarter results and will carry through the -- throughout the year and into 2022. In the second quarter, we grew our deliveries 14% year-over-year and grew revenues 22%, which drove a net after-tax income increase of 61% and an after-tax pre-extraordinary item increase of 79%. Our bottom line increase is driven by our second quarter gross margin of 26.1% versus 21.6% last year. And as noted in our press release, we expect our deliveries for the year to be consistent with prior guidance given the stressed supply chain, while our gross margin continues to grow consistently throughout the year. At the same time, we've remained focused on improving our operating efficiency, driving our SG&A down to a second quarter all-time low at 7.6% versus 8.3% last year and driving our net margin to 18.5% this year versus 13.3% last year. Alongside our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services Group has continued to exceed all expectations with $121 million of earnings contribution, in part due to excellent secondary market execution. The consistent performance beat from this group, however, continues to be driven by constant work and rework of the cost structure even while costs are going up generally. Together with our asset-light focus, strong gross and net margins and financial services execution, we are driving significantly higher cash flow, which is driving balance sheet improvement as well. In our second quarter, we achieved our 50% owned versus controlled land ratio goal 2 quarters earlier than expected, and we reduced our land supply to 3.3 years from 3.9 years last year. All of these events drove our balance sheet to a 23.1% debt-to-total capital ratio with almost $2.6 billion of cash and zero borrowed on our bank line. Let me briefly focus attention on return on equity, return on capital and our inventory turn. I've noted to many of you that we remain very focused on cash flow, returns and inventory returns, and we have. Our return on equity stands now at 18.8%, which is 550 basis point -- a 550 basis point improvement over last year. Our return on capital is now 15% and a 500 basis point improvement. And our inventory turn, which is just starting to move, now stands at 1x turn, which is up from 0.9 last year. While Diane will give more detail and our guidance in her comments, it's important to note that these components are squarely in our focus. They continue to make a compelling case for multiple expansion, and they are at the top of our mind as we consider, configure and size our proposed spin-off. These dramatic points of improvement, which we expect to continue through the year, have enabled us to reconsider the size of our spin-off and actually aim for a larger asset base in order to further fortify this fun business. Accordingly, we are now targeting an asset base of $5 billion to $6 billion, which is -- which will lead the remaining Lennar pure-play homebuilding and financial services company with an appropriately liquid balance sheet and no material loss of reported earnings. We continue to believe that the best way to enhance Lennar's business model is as a standalone pure-play, asset-light high inventory turn, homebuilder manufacturer and financial services company. Aside from size, we have very little to update on the spin this quarter. As noted last quarter, the new company will be configured as an independent and active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support our ongoing business vertical. Two of these verticals have raised third-party capital -- have already raised third-party capital and are active asset managers. That's LMC, our multifamily platform, and LSFR, our growing single-family for rent platform. Both of these platforms are neatly configured as independent self-sustaining operations. Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing independent land and land management business, and we have a growing technology investment business, which is part of LENx. As I noted last quarter, this separation from the homebuilder will enable these blue-chip businesses to thrive and excel independently. And while I'm certain that you all would like a lot more detail, you can expect to hear a lot more about the spin in our next quarter's earnings release. So let me wrap up by saying that we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market. We have an amazing group of talented associates driving our business forward and caring about the world around them. We are performing excellently on all metrics, driven by strategies that have worked to our benefit. The market condition remains extremely strong for the foreseeable future. As I've noted, we expect a very strong second half of 2021. While we are not projecting more deliveries, given the very tight land, labor and materials market, we are projecting growing gross margin and a very healthy bottom line. As we begin to look to 2022, we see continued strength in the market. Simply put, supply is short and demand is strong. Some are concerned that demand is slowing as prices move higher and interest rates move. It feels to us that sales are slowing because many sales were made early, and building through those sales is slower than expected. We believe that home production has been constrained for a decade, and we are making up for the deficit now, which should keep the housing market thriving for some time to come. With that, let me turn it over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong, our team is extremely well coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine where we carefully match homebuilding production with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this environment, it makes no sense to sell too far out ahead because you lose your ability to offset potential pricing cost increases with sales price increases. In addition, in this appreciating market with slightly longer cycle times, we are strategically selling our homes later in the production cycle of the home to allow for further cost protection and sales price appreciation. Our first quarter results prove out the success of the strategy, as we achieved gross margin increases of 450 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. During the second quarter, we started 5.5 homes per community, which was a 90% increase from last year and a 20% increase sequentially. This production and margin-driven, sales-focused program will drive further margin improvement and increase deliveries in the back half of the year, given our ramp up in starts in the second quarter. In the second quarter, new orders, deliveries and gross margins were up strongly in each of our operating regions. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories from entry-level to move-up and in our active adult communities. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 8.6% in the quarter, down 1,020 basis points from last year and 100 basis points sequentially. This is additional evidence that our buyers have the required down payment and mortgage qualifications to purchase a new home. As we look across the country, we're seeing strength in all of our markets. Here's some color on some of our stronger markets.  Starting in Florida. Florida continues to benefit from core local demand as well as in migration from the Northeast and the West Coast, which is driving both sales pace and price. Inventory is extremely limited, and buyers are moving fast to go to contract. The hottest markets in Florida are Naples and Sarasota in the Southwest; Miami, Broward and Dade in the Southeast and Tampa. These are all markets where we are the leading builder with the best land positions. In the Carolinas, Raleigh, Charlotte and Charleston are extremely strong markets, benefiting from limited inventory, job growth and quality of living. We are the top builder in each of these markets. Texas continues to be the strongest state in the country with in-migration from the East and West. The state's pro-business, employer-friendly economy is driving corporate relocations and a tremendous job growth, especially in the technology sector. The state is also benefiting from the recovery in the oil and gas sector. The strongest market in the United States today is Austin. Notwithstanding out migration from parts of California, the markets in California are strong. Driven by the state's severe housing shortage, there is more demand than supply, making housing the #1 agenda item for the Governor. The Inland Empire, Sacramento and the East Bay area are the strongest markets. All are seeing a migration from the coastal markets due to a higher level of affordability, compounded with the opportunity to buy a larger home for the money. This extra boost in demand, combined with limited inventory in great schools, is fueling demand in these areas. Phoenix and Las Vegas are strong markets. Both are benefiting from business-friendly environments, real job growth and in-migration from California. Las Vegas is benefiting from the full reopening of the casinos and increased tourism, and Phoenix is thriving due to real affordability. The Pacific Northwest continues to be strong. The market has a natural supply constraints and constraints by urban growth boundaries that limit production. As I said, these are some of the strongest markets, but they're strength and depth of market across the company -- country. Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth in community count. Even as we continue to close out communities at a much faster pace than expected given the strength in the market, our community count at the end of the second quarter grew to 1,225 communities, up 63 communities or 5.4% from the end of the first quarter. We are also still on track to end fiscal 2021 with approximately 10% more communities on a year-over-year basis. This should position us for consistent continued growth in fiscal 2022. Finally, I'd like to give you some additional details on LSFR, Lennar's single-family rental platform. As we discussed last quarter, Lennar formed LSFR to facilitate a better time delivery of our homes with reduced cycle times and to make the single-family lifestyle accessible to more families. At the end of the first quarter, LSFR formed the Upward America Venture, which was capitalized with $1.25 billion of equity from blue-chip institutional investors. Just after the end of the second quarter, LSFR closed a $750 million credit facility with Deutsche Bank, which, combined with the equity commitments, positions the Upward America Venture with extremely cost-effective capital to acquire over $4 billion of purpose-built communities and scattered site homes from Lennar. We expect Lennar's peak capital investment in the venture to be $50 million over the duration of the vehicle. Since the beginning, the Upward America Venture has purchased 216 homes for approximately $48 million. These homes were located in 18 communities in 7 markets across 3 of Lennar's operating regions. 188 of these homes were purchased in purpose-built communities and 28 were scattered homes purchased on a just-in-time basis from available inventory in Lennar's existing for-sale communities. All of these homes fit a predetermined buy box approved by the venture's equity investors. To facilitate the purchase of these homes, LSFR worked hand-in-hand with LENx to develop proprietary technology that produces automated underwriting and pricing that harnesses Lennar's data management and business intelligence systems along with third-party data to evaluate which of Lennar's homes fit within the venture's buy box. At the end of the second quarter, the Upward America Venture had a pipeline of 2,534 homes under contract located in 29 communities across 11 markets with a total purchase price of $596 million. 2,500 of these homes are in purpose-built communities and 34 homes are scattered homes in Lennar's existing for-sale communities. As Stuart mentioned in his opening comments, the social aspect of providing affordable housing and making the single-family lifestyle available to more families is a critical aspect to the Upward America Venture. This is proving to be just the case as the average leased rent in the portfolio to date is $1,729, meaning that a household making $59,280 a year or more can afford to live in a brand-new home without a down payment. To put some perspective on this, the average teacher salary in 2019 and 2020 in the U.S. was $63,465. This lines up squarely with our goal of providing brand-new, high-quality homes at affordable prices. This is workforce housing with a single-family lifestyle. To expand on the potential to provide real home ownership to a broader base of families, we have focused on developing a rent-to-own program for scattered home purchases within the Upward America Venture. We are in the final stages of developing this program with Divvy, a LENx portfolio company. Divvy is a market leader in upward mobility for renters across the country. We expect this program to be up and running in the third quarter. We are very excited with the progress we've made so far with LSFR, the demand for single-family rental homes remain strong, lease up times are compressing, and we have seen real rent growth. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thank you, Rick. Today, I'm going to walk you through 2 topics: how we execute on our asset-light land strategy for a just-in-time delivery system of home sites and how we are managing the current unprecedented challenges of supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. As Stuart noted, Lennar has made significant strides in strengthening our balance sheet with improved cash flow generation, driven primarily by the reduction in land owned versus optioned in the years of land owned, which respectively stand at 50% option and 3.3 years. In the second quarter, we added about 38,000 home sites net to our controlled total and purchased about 21,500 home sites. We began our asset-light focus years ago, starting with several large regional land relationships who own and develop land on Lennar's behalf. We then created a strategic national process around our approach. The first critical step in formulating this approach was to separate land into 3 distinct risk categories. The first category is finished land that is ready for the construction of homes to be started. The second is land under development being readied for the first category is typically less than 4 to 5 years from being ready for construction starts. Land in the third category is beyond the 4 to 5-year period that may need some entitlement, significant planning and has not yet started development. After separating land into these 3 buckets, we then match the risk profile of each asset with the right source of risk-adjusted capital and expertise. The first category of land is carried on our balance sheet as it is the land under the homes we are building. This land has no risk to it, and our cash on hand or revolver are the lowest cost of capital for it. The second and third categories of land are structured as option agreements with various strategic relationships that have the strength in capital that fit the specific land profile. Assets that are low in risk profile may go into land banks, which have the next lowest cost of capital. Other more complex land is a good fit for our large regional relationships. More recently, we have added significantly larger national relationships structured to match the type and land asset and also contractually structured option agreements, which will survive potential market shocks that has historically created risk to defaulting on option deposits and to maintaining control of the option land, thus further reducing risk. The distinct land business is compromised -- sorry, this distinct land business is comprised of an operational team with a singular focus on executing our asset-light strategy by closely coordinating with our local division teams and our strategic third-party relationships. This independent team works to ensure a consistent application of processes and procedures to execute on all of the moving pieces from land underwriting to acquisition, development and completion of just-in-time home sites. Importantly, the independence of this team takes the burden off of our homebuilding divisions of negotiating unique individual option agreements with third parties, thereby allowing our divisions to be laser-focused on running our core homebuilding operations. It also provides all of our third-party relationships the ability to work with one voice from a large geographically diverse company.  Our focus on separating our land purchases into these 3 distinct risk buckets has allowed us to secure the most cost-effective capital for each land asset. As a result, we are lowering Lennar's cost and risk associated with purchasing each category of land. Now I'd like to discuss how Lennar is managing the current environment of supply chain disruptions. You are all familiar with what is occurring. The supply chain has been impacted by the pandemic, by the storms in Texas and by the surge in demand from new construction and big box retailers. Many manufacturers are finding themselves without the materials and/or capacity to keep up with their orders. Additionally, there's a nationwide shortage of trucks and drivers that add to the disruption. As you would expect at Lennar, we have brought an intense daily focus on managing this situation. We are effectively managing it through leveraging our strategic supply chain relationships as well as having an unprecedented internal connectivity between our division, regional and national purchasing teams.  Today, we work very closely with the leadership of our strategic supply partners as a result of having been focused on being their builder of choice over the 5 -- over the past 5 years. We have deeply -- we have been deeply involved and over time in developing relationships, processes and procedures to improve their businesses. This is not just lip service as over the past 5 years, Lennar's changed the way we run our business to improve the bottom lines of our strategic partners’ businesses. Our actions have earned us the right to sit down with our strategic suppliers and find solutions to today's challenges. Sometimes, it's expediting orders and even warehousing early deliveries. In some cases, it's substituting products. But in all situations, we, together with our partners, are finding solutions. The net effect of these disruptions is about a 2-week increase to our cycle times. With respect to our local trade partners, the shortage of labor persists now more than ever. Like the supply chain situation, we have brought an intense daily focus to manage this. Again, our Builder of Choice focus for the past 5-plus years is paying dividends. We've also changed the way we do business with our local building trades over this period of time. Significantly, we have refined the forecasting and communication of starts and have implemented Lennar's level-scheduling program for greater visibility of the upcoming workloads for our trade partners. Today, we now have real-time dashboards showing exactly how many tasks each trade has in the coming weeks and months. This enables them to accurately plan for their labor needs and keep our job sites productive. We believe these dashboards to be a best-in-class forecasting and communication solution. Also significant for both our suppliers and our local trade partners is our adherence to Lennar's Everything's Included program. This has never been more important. It simplifies the number of SKUs or suppliers and local trades need to carry. In addition, in this current environment, we've taken further steps to reduce the number of SKUs we use in certain constrained categories. Other areas of focus for us are using our level-scheduling dashboards to support our ongoing even flow commitment to our trade partners, along with maintaining our production-first focus on matching sales to starts, as Rick discussed. Turning to the cost impacts from the combination of supply chain disruptions. The spike in lumber and trade shortages, our construction costs in the second quarter were up 3.9% sequentially and 4.5% year-over-year. However, even as construction costs increased, they decreased as a percent of revenues from 41.8% and 44.5% sequentially and year-over-year, respectively, down to 41.3% in our second quarter. With respect to lumber specifically, we all know that lumber reached an all-time high before very recently coming off of that. Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted, and Diane will cover in more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this, and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our -- on lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we will see a more significant benefit for our August starts. Lastly, I want to thank the associates of our national land team led by Casey Davis and Jim Bavouset, with close coordination with all of our division land teams effectively executed our land-light strategy and just-in-time home site delivery strategy. I also want to thank our national, regional and division purchasing associates led by Kemp Gillis, who have the difficult job of battling through these unprecedented supply chain disruptions, has done so with tremendous focus, effort and poise. Now I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Well, thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Although you've heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I'll begin by recapping certain Q2 2021 highlights and then providing detailed guidance for Q3 2021 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2021. So starting with homebuilding. For the quarter, new orders totaled 17,157 homes, a 32% increase year-over-year. We ended the quarter with 24,741 homes in backlog with a dollar value of $11 billion and 1,225 active communities. Our cancellation rate was 8.6%. For the quarter, deliveries totaled 14,493 homes, up 14% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 26.1%, up 450 basis points from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a continued focus on maximizing sales price, while controlling cost increases, as Jon described. Additionally, our margins benefited by a 20 basis point decrease in interest expense as compared to the prior year as a result of our consistent focus on debt reduction. Our SG&A was 7.6%, an improvement of 70 basis points from the prior year. This decrease is primarily a result of our intense focus on incorporating technology to gain efficiencies across our homebuilding platform. So for the quarter, we generated a net margin of 18.5%, the highest quarter net margin of a repeat. Our financial services team also executed at high levels, reporting $121 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $92 million compared to $81 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited from an increase in secondary margins. Title operations -- Title operating earnings were $24 million compared to $76 million in the prior year. The prior year included a gain of $61 million on the deconsolidation of states title now called Doma. Excluding this gain, title earnings increased due to growth in both volume and the margins as technology initiatives improved agency productivity. And then turning to our Lennar Other segment. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our residential solar platform to Sunnova Energy International in exchange for shares in that company. At the time of the closing, we recorded a gain of $151 million. We are required to mark-to-market our investment in Sunnova as well as our investment in Opendoor, which went public in our first quarter, at each quarter end based on their stock prices at that time. Accordingly, we recorded mark-to-market losses in the second quarter of approximately [$273 million]. And now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to execute on our strategy to become asset-lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and homes, improving returns and generating significant homebuilding cash flow. At quarter end, we owned 189,000 homesites and controlled 192,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.3 years from 3.9 years in the prior year and our homesites controlled increasing to 50% from 32% in the prior year, thus achieving our controlled percentage goal midyear instead of end of year. All of this progress resulted in achieving a 20% return on inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, and is consistent with our intense focus on increasing all of our returns.  During the quarter, we paid dividends totaling $78 million, and we repurchased 1 million shares totaling $98 million. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt-to-total capital was 23.1%, down from 31.2% in the prior year. After quarter end, in fact, just this week, we retired early at par our $300 million 6.25 senior notes that were due in December 2021, further reducing our senior note balance and saving about $9 million in interest. Our next maturity, $600 million due in January 2022 as a 3-month par call, which we will utilize to prepay those notes in October of this year. After that payment, we will have no senior note maturities until October 2022. And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to approximately $20 billion from $17 billion in Q2 of the prior year, and our book value per share increased to $62.68 from $52.98 in the prior year. And finally, last week, we were upgraded to investment grade by S&P. We are really pleased with the rating agency upgrades we have achieved in recent months and are now investment grade in all 3 -- with all 3 agencies. So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong, and we will, of course, continue to remain focused on generating high returns for our shareholders. So with that brief overview, now let's turn to guidance. I'll first provide detailed guidance for the third quarter and then some high-level guidance for the fiscal year, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q3 new orders to be in the range of 16,000 to 16,300 homes and our Q3 deliveries to be in the range of 15,800 to 16,100 homes. Our Q3 average sales price should be between $420,000 and $425,000. We expect our gross margin to be in the range of 27% to 27.5% for Q3, and we expect our SG&A to be in the range of 7.3% to 7.4%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q3 loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. And then looking at our Other business segments. For Financial Services, we believe our Financial Services earnings for Q3 will be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. And for our multifamily operations, we expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect a loss in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Now note that this guidance does not include any potential mark-to-market adjustments on our current or future publicly traded technology investments. We expect our Q3 corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues. And our Charitable Foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivery for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 22.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 310 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $3.07 to $3.32 per share for the quarter. And now let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year. We believe our average sales price for the year will be about $420,000, and we still expect our community count to increase approximately 10% year-over-year by year-end. Our Financial Services earnings will be in the range of $460,000 to $470 million. And finally, our tax rate should be about 23.5%. And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategy, maintain a strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned for an excellent year. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: First question, I just wanted to hit on probably the #1 area of concern today, which is around demand trends. And I think there's been concerns specifically around the potential for demand slowing a little bit in the face of the extraordinary amount of home price appreciation that's occurred over the last several months. Stuart, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you view that sales have been slowing more due to, in effect, production constraints and managing the sales pace. I was hoping for any sense of how you view demand as it progressed throughout the quarter, and what makes you comfortable around the idea that overall the demand backdrop remains not only robust, but it appears still well in excess of available supply.
Stuart Miller: So look, let me start with a notion, proposition that the market has been extremely, extremely hot. So, when you go from extremely, extremely hot to extremely hot, that's a step down that is really quite acceptable. It's actually a little bit better. And of course, as pricing goes up, people -- fewer people can afford. So, I would just say, Mike, that while the market might have a mild cooling, it is just from such a high level that demand is still well in excess of supply, and we see this on the ground at our Welcome Home centers on a regular basis, and this is not in any specific market. It really is across the country. So, when we look at the temperament, the tempo of sales in our Welcome Home centers, the traffic that's coming in, the discussions that we're having, we're still seeing very strong demand. We still see very limited supply, and we recognize that the country and the production of housing has been in deficit for the better part of a decade, and we can argue whether the deficit is one size or another. I think that there are a lot of competing views on that. But still, based on what we see in the market and the logic that we're applying to what we've seen over the past years and the appetite of the buying public, the millennials that still haven't come out of their parents' homes, we think there's a very, very strong demand profile that is out there for an extended period of time.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I guess I'd add to that, Michael, that if you look at the quarter, we sold 17,000-plus homes during the quarter, and the variability between the months was plus or minus 100 homes. So, we really see no impact associated with the cooling.
Jon Jaffe: And again, for us, that ties into our match strategy of sales to production. We’re able to hit exactly that pace. As Stuart said, when you go from very, very hot to very hot, that's still well above the levels we were at a year ago, which were very strong.
Michael Rehaut: Right. No, that all makes sense. Secondly, I think perhaps the other key area of debate out there right now is around the sustainability of gross margins. And with the success that you've highlighted this year in terms of managing sales pace and opportunistically improving margin, and obviously a part of that is to cover cost inflation, but you've been able to do well in excess of that. It's interesting right now that the gross margins you're projecting for '21 are in excess of the prior peak margins in 2005. Interestingly, you're on track to have revenue -- homebuilding revenue more than double 2005. And so, you'd think that there are scale benefits certainly associated with that, but I was wondering if you could give any perhaps thoughts on how you think about gross margins going forward over the next couple of years? Obviously, I'm not asking for guidance for '22, but just more broadly when you think about the gross margin levels that you're generating for this year, what might be the puts and takes outside of sales incentives, which are hard to predict, how you see gross margins, let's say, this cycle and perhaps over the next couple of years versus the last cycle?
Stuart Miller: So look, let's take out just the volume component of improvement in margin. I mean, if you look at the composition of our margin, it is a combination of a lot more efficiency in the way that we're managing our company, the technologies that we're engaging in and incorporating into the way that we're running our business; the efficiency of our land program, just-in-time delivery of land; and frankly, the emergent inventory management component of our single-family for rent. There are tremendous efficiencies that we are embedding in the core operation of our business, and we think that these are becoming more and more important. The way that we're managing our supply chain is a matter of absolute efficiencies being brought into the way that we're operating our business. And you're going to see that we, as a company and hopefully as an industry, are recasting the cost structure all the way from hard cost, labor materials, to the softer costs around SG&A. We are rewiring the way that this business operates to the benefit of a lower cost structure and an opportunity to maintain good margins and still bring affordability to the housing market. And I think that, that's been an extreme part of our program. I do want to highlight that additionally, wind at our backs is our reduced debt level. As we bring debt down, we have less capital costs, and that's continuing to help our margin picture, and we expect to continue to bring that debt level down. So, all of the components, from technology, the way we run our business, debt levels, the way that we're just in -- we're becoming more of a just-in-time program, I think is a protective coating around margins for the future, and we're pretty optimistic about where we're going.
Jon Jaffe: I'll only add that as I’ve noted in my comments with a focus on purchasing, we’ve brought our direct cost down to 41.3% -- sorry, 40.1% of our revenues, and so if you look at that ratio, we've got a lot of room to go before the lines cross between revenues going off and cost to be able to maintain our margins.
Rick Beckwitt: And I guess the final point I'd make is if you look at what we're building today compared to that 2005, 2006 timeframe, our homes are so much more value-engineered and efficient to build. So, the cost structure associated with the production of those homes is significantly different than the last cycle.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.
Stephen Kim: I'm going to just say that I think people would really love to hear a little bit about the SpinCo and particularly, what you think the book value reduction would be when you spun it off. I think you talked about the assets, but the book value, I think, would be important. But my questions are going to focus on the core homebuilding business. In this environment where you're deliberately, in some cases, holding back sales to age your work in process inventory, it seems like the best indication of future sales isn't actually the number of homes you're selling today, but how many homes you're building. And given that, I noticed that your starts in 2Q were up about 28% from 1Q. The nation's starts were only up 7% sequentially, not seasonally adjusted. So clearly, you're gaining a lot of share. You've started -- I think the actual number was like over 20,000 units in the quarter. And I would think your production capability should increase from here because your community count is increasing. So my question is basically, is it reasonable to think that before too long, your closings should be able to exceed 20,000 units in a quarter?
Stuart Miller: Well, let me give a couple of corrective pieces. First of all, Steve, most importantly, we never deliver units. It's always homes at Lennar. So we've just got to get that one right. Number two, on SpinCo, when we talk about a spin in terms of dollars, we're talking about book value. So when you asked -- I think that when you asked the question, which we won't hold that as one of your questions about SpinCo and the impact to book, it is a direct 1:1 dollar. It's a book dollar amount. Is that clear?
Stephen Kim : Right. Yes. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Yes. And then as it relates to our starts, our starts I think are not 19.5, over 20. But I'll let Jon and Rick address the question.
Jon Jaffe: Look, we've been very laser focused on our even flow production and just gradually ramping that up to the increased start level that you noted. And that ultimately does flow through. As I noted, we're seeing about a 2-week cycle time delay. So it's not going to perfectly flow through, but we should see in subsequent quarters, our deliveries matching that start pace.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, and just to further what Jon said, we purposely did start a higher number of homes in the last quarter because we've seen demand. And so if you look at it from a start sales differential, it was about 2,500 more homes started than sold, but we could have sold all of those homes. We're just choosing to sell them later in the construction cycle in order to maximize margin and to take advantage of a more finally tuned delivery cycle.
Stephen Kim: Yes, absolutely. Makes sense. Very sensible strategy, I would say. The second question relates to home prices. I think the most striking development across the market has been this massive surge in home prices, not just that you're experiencing, but across the market. According to some measures, resale pricing is up 25% year-over-year. When people hear this, and they instinctively think it's a setup for home prices to fall in the future, which, by the way, would set off a pretty bad chain of events if it happened, our own view is that the price jump is a correction rather than an overshoot. It's the result of years of undersupply and pent-up demand and not just low interest rates. And so it makes it very different from like '05, like when demand was very speculative and supply wasn't constrained. But I think people would really like to hear from you how you see the longer-term outlook for pricing. Are we seeing a blow off peak like what happened recently to lumber futures or something? Or have we found a new level of home price that can be resilient in the face of potentially higher rates?
Stuart Miller: Look, from everything that we're seeing in the field, I think that we're just hitting a new level. I think I wouldn't have thought of it as a correction, but the way that you've said it, I think that, that makes sense. I think that home prices are and have reached a point and are continuing to grow, by the way. This is not -- this hasn't slowed. But the home prices have clear -- are reaching a point where it is kind of a correction to a higher price level. I think it's stagnated for a very long period of time as we went through the underproduction years and maybe the mortgage market kind of disabled the production and the demand for homes or certainly early after the downturn. But you have this really interesting time where, not only has the mortgage market normalized, and I think normalized in a very credible way, very protective of that mortgage market, but you also have this really interesting demand coming from single-family for rent. And there's some questions around single-family for rent in interesting ways, but single-family for rent is enabling a single-family lifestyle to a broader range of people who cannot necessarily acquire the down payment or meet the metrics that are needed to qualify for a mortgage, but certainly have the ability to afford the rent on a single-family lifestyle. And this notion that the way that people live, the housing that is available to a broader range of people is -- its very predictive of outcomes for families is a really important component that's emergent. And the enablement of the single-family for rent business is just enabling homes available to a broader range, a bigger part of the population, and I think this is a greater good. And we believe, and I think Rick daylighted it and highlighted it very well, we believe that when we're providing more workforce housing, we're expanding the amount of demand that's out there. And yes, we're driving costs up or the price of housing up a little bit. That is driving the cost of housing up because there's more demand and less supply. But at the same time, it's asking the industry to provide more and provide more accessibility to more people. I think that's a generally great impact for the industry.
Stephen Kim: Yes, I agree. The stepping stone there or the single-family for rent is really an important development.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman.
Ivy Zelman: Actually, it's Ivy Zelman. So maybe, Stuart, just to clarify. So maybe, Jon, you said that you're purposely starting more so you can sell later in the process. But your guidance for sales for next quarter, just to be clear, it remains. The gap is still there prevalent. So does that just mean that you're going to hold those? Or you just don't want to guide to the full production capacity that you can, in fact, produce?
Jon Jaffe: We think that's accurate guidance, Ivy, based on us very methodically scheduling when we're going to sell a home. It's not the same in all markets. It's later in some markets than others, but it's a very carefully, very meticulous plan not to sell out ahead of ourselves.
Ivy Zelman: Okay. Just wanted to make sure. So let me go to a higher-level question, Stuart, for you. Recognizing that we are seeing inflation -- robust inflation across the entire ecosystem, including home prices that Steve Kim just addressed and as well as rent inflation, especially single-family rent inflation that I think Invitation Homes and American Homes rent actually at NAREIT, so that they were raising a new move-in up 14%, 17%. We've got home prices in places like Austin, up 25%. Do you not think that there's going to be some type of affordability for both asset classes that wages are certainly not increasing at those levels? Where is the ceiling where it's no longer affordable for a renter or for a home buyer?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, I don't think that there's math that can tell us where there might be a ceiling. And it seems to us that wages are increasing and home or the cost of home -- I don't even want to say ownership of the cost of living is going up at the same time, and that defines the inflationary environment. But where do you find affordability? I think, Rick, again, did a really interesting job of laying out that the single-family-for-rent world is kind of an equalizer in that field. And the program that we're really working on is saying, "Okay, so housing affordability might be out of the reach of some people. How do we bring it in the reach through a rental program? And then how do we start to build a rental program that provides upward mobility so that, that renter can start to become an owner earning the credentials to get there?" When you can make single-family lifestyle available to our workforce, and that workforce starts with a rental and can earn into owning it, it just creates a stepping stone, and it enables that workforce to afford that higher-priced home. Now where is the top? It's certainly going to plateau at some point. But the question is, where is that moment? We're not sure right now. We're going to walk that walk together.
Jon Jaffe: Ivy, also remember from a macro view that today, the home is the hub of people's life, very different than it was in the past. So it's not just where they live. It's where they work. It's where they educate. It's where they recreate. And post pandemic, that's still going to be the case for the large part, and therefore, people view the home as more valuable and will put a larger portion of their income towards that more important asset in the home.
Ivy Zelman: No, that's helpful. And just to clarify, because we've seen a lot of the single-family rental production that's now being leased up, it's comparable on a square-footage basis, if not higher, to a monthly payment as a for sale. So are you suggesting that your workforce housing that you're providing on the single-family rental space is going to be below the monthly payment because of the -- obviously, costs are monthly, the consumer thinks of it as a monthly payment. Because we're seeing it not only in line apples-to-apples, but even at a premium. So are you taking a different strategy than your competitors?
Rick Beckwitt: Our strategy is to provide single-family home ownership for workforce housing for people that can afford to rent and qualify for that housing. So if you look at comparable rents in the neighboring areas, it's stacking right on top of what comparable rents are. And most of the issues are, Ivy, is these people don't have the down payment that's required to afford to buy a home. It's not that they can't pay the mortgage payment, they just can't qualify in other ways.
Jon Jaffe: And so our focus is on a monthly payment that's very similar to the -- what a mortgage payment be, but, as Rick highlighted, without the down payment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs.
Susan Maklari: My first question is, you talked about the focus that you have on ROEs and improving that. And when we think back to the last housing cycle, your ROEs were at least in the mid-20s, maybe even the high 20s in our model, and granted there's changes in the business today relative to them. But back then, it was more of an output of what was going on in the housing market. When you think about the focus that you have today on expanding those ROEs and all the different elements of the business that are coming together, where do you think your returns can get to this time? And how do we think about that path relative to the past?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, I think that one of the limiting factors is the fact that the equity is growing at a sizable clip. That's a positive, but a limiting factor relative to ROE. At the end of the day, we continue to see growth in our earnings and therefore, growth in our returns limited by the fact that the equity is growing at a pretty sizable clip. I think you have to think in terms of as we move forward with our spin, it also helps to define the efficiency and the effectiveness of the way that we're running our business in our core homebuilding business, where we're able to focus an equity base that is just geared towards the homebuilding business. I think you'll see that return kind of revert back to some of the ROEs that define the industry at an earlier time. So it's a combination of things, but the efficiency that we're injecting in our business is going to continue to grow our returns, which will be even further enhanced by the separating of logical businesses to where they can operate most effectively.
Susan Maklari: Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is on lumber. Obviously, we've seen that come down in the last week or so. You talked about the benefits that you expect to see from that in the back half of the year. But can you talk to what you're seeing out there in terms of the lumber market? How sustainable do you feel like this pullback is? And how are you kind of planning for cost as we think about the future quarters and going into '22?
JonJaffe: With respect to lumber, I don't think anyone felt at the high level that it was at most sustainable and it was sort of the perfect storm. We've seen, I think, at the beginning stages of the pullback in lumber costs, a pullback in demand from the big box retailers as the do-it-yourself market postponed projects for 2 reasons. One is for post-pandemic, they're spending money and their time elsewhere and they didn't want to pay that high cost. So there's been a pullback on demand on the lumber supply chain, which has started to bring costs down from those unsustainable levels. So as we think about it, every 10% reduction in random lengths equates to about -- plus or minus $1,700 of our average size home. And for OSB, about the same, about another $1,700 per home. So as you see it drop from the level of higher $1,500, we'd expect probably our August starts to see a benefit of $200,000 to $300,000 board feet in random lengths. OSB less than that does not start coming down yet, but it should follow suit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research.
Truman Patterson: So I wanted to follow up a little bit but ask about affordability in a little different way. So very, very strong gross margins, strong pricing. Fourth quarter gross margin suggests that you all are more than covering peak lumber costs, right? And now we've seen lumber roll over. So that likely will be able to offset some of these other cost pressures that are picking up. So if inflation aggregated kind of levels off in the back half of the year, especially as you all are opening more communities, just want to understand your philosophy on pricing. Are you all looking to step off the gas to maintain affordability if rates begin to rise? Or is it truly pricing to the market really without regard for potential rate hikes?
Stuart Miller: So Truman, the first thing I want to say is thank you for acknowledging our Everything's Included quarter. We were all touched by that.
Truman Patterson: Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Yes. So look, your question is to throw back to discussions that we've had many times over quarters in the past. It's been less of a discussion point as the market has evolved more recently, but we're very, very focused on our pricing to meet market conditions. And our dynamic pricing model is all about measuring where the market is and going to the pricing at where the market is currently. So the answer is, as prices might fluctuate, as price increases perhaps moderate or plateau, our dynamic pricing model is very much focused on getting us to the exact pricing to reach our deliveries commensurate with where our production has been. So the answer is you can very much expect that our pricing will moderate, as the market moderates or accelerate as the market accelerates, can be very tuned into market conditions.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. And this is so consistent with everything we've talked about really for the last 3 or 4 years. We've been matching sales with production. And we -- Jon and I tinker with where we'll sell during the production cycle based on that fundamental demand in the marketplace. So it's a very precise production-driven sales program.
Stuart Miller: And we haven't talked about our dynamic pricing program for a while, but it's just become kind of part of the fabric of the way we operate, and it's getting better and better with each passing quarter. It's just not top of discussion right now.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Okay. And then Diane, this might be one for you. But $2.6 billion in cash on the balance sheet, we're expecting a lot of free cash flow in the back half of the year, next year, well over $2 billion plus, right? A couple-part question. One, what cash balance do you feel comfortable maintaining? And then how should we really think about share repurchases going forward, either a quantitative discussion. Is it programmatic, opportunistic, especially in regard with the equities pulling back recently.
Diane Bessette: Yes. I think, Truman, that we saw we jumped back into the market again this quarter with 1 million shares. And I guess my thinking is that it's probably a little bit of both programmatic as well as opportunistic. And on that, I mean, I think buying some level of shares every quarter is the right answer. However, I think we should also be opportunistic. So as there are dips in the stock, then we can take advantage of those dips because we have the cash to do so. So I think just having a consistent program is, first and foremost, the most important thing, but you'll find that we'll be opportunistic within each quarter to take advantage of whatever the market might bring to us.
Stuart Miller: Yes. But let me just say that with that said, Truman, you bring up the fact that we have a lot of cash on the book right now and are likely to generate more in the back half of the year, isn't it great? I mean we've been laser-focused on cash flow.
Diane Bessette: Yes.
Stuart Miller: And it's really starting to show just how our focus has consistently rippled through our numbers. I think the one thing I want to add to Diane's comments, you might expect a more bold statement about stock buyback, and we don't really give color as to where we're going on that as we look ahead. But the thing to also keep in mind is that we're also working with the composition and the size of our spin, and we're laser-focused on the spin-off. And we want to make sure that our balance sheet properly supports the extent of what we want to do because we're not just going to -- it's not just about building an ever better Lennar homebuilding and financial services group. It's also -- and which historically, when we spun LNR back off in the '90s, we've built a great company, a durable, sustainable company, and we expect to do the exact same thing with the spun company here. And we're enthusiastic about presenting more in the future on that, but our balance sheet, our cash position and the size and scope of the spin, all work together. So I'd say just bear with us a little bit as we put these pieces together because it all ties together with our stock buyback program.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Is there a certain cash balance that you want to maintain to support the core homebuilding operations?
Stuart Miller: The way we think about cash is more.
Diane Bessette: Yes.
Stuart Miller: We're not going to limit cash flow, and we're -- listen, to that point, don't think that a 50-50 land-owned versus controlled program is where it ends. We hit our goal early, and we're still focused on migrating forward. Jon's articulation of our land strategy and the waterfall of short-term, medium-term, long-term land and the way that we're configuring to maximize cost of capital and where we put land and how we generate cash flow is something that we work on, Rick, Jon and myself work on every day. So cash flow continues to be a focal point of this company.
Diane Bessette: Yes. And Truman, just to add also, as I mentioned, alongside also with the continued debt focus. So you see us reaching into 2022 with those debt maturities, pulling them forward and really getting some positive impact to our margin as we have done that.
Stuart Miller: And so for punctuation at the end of your question, I want to say again, thank you for the Everything's Included call out.
Operator: And our last question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW.
Jade Rahmani: I appreciate the chance to ask question. I just wanted to ask at a high level, to what extent do you think Lennar in particular, but also the major production builders are in control of their own destiny? You mentioned various factors, including the land strategy, relationships with suppliers. So to some extent, since new home sales are only about 10% of total aggregate home sales, you can tailor the product to the market. Just overall question, do you think that the company is a price taker, a price giver. And overall, how would you respond to that question?
Stuart Miller: Well, it's great that we're going to get to metaphysics in the call today. But I guess I'd always say, Jade, that we're always a little bit of both. The fact of the matter is market conditions dictate a portion of what defines what we're able to do, but also our ability to work and act within market conditions is in part a driver of how we perform and how our product is received and the pricing that we get for that. So I would say there isn't a binary answer to the question of whether we're a price taker or a price maker.  I think in every market condition, there is a dynamic that is, in part, given to us and, in part, maximized by us. And in that regard, I've tried to be very clear in my comments, and I think Rick and Jon as well and Diane have all daylighted that we're sitting in the midst of market conditions that are very strong. And those market conditions are moving around a little bit, but very, very strong short supply, long demand. And that's the market that is given to us. But within the condition of that market, we're probably reporting our numbers saying that we have maximized the market that's in front of us. We've made strategic moves that has enabled us to navigate these waters as well as can be. And we think we've done a really good job, and we think that we can continue to get better and better being posed, at the same time, a price taker and a price maker navigating interesting waters. So that's how I'd answer that. I don't know.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. To give a little bit additional perspective, it varies dramatically by market. We have some markets where we're 30% to 40% of the share of the market. And in those markets, we have the ability to control things a little bit more, and we're setting the cadence in that market. In markets where a smaller percentage, we're really pricing to market as we've done in for really the last several years. So it really varies across the board depending on the market.
Stuart Miller: So why don't we go ahead and end it there? And let me say just kind of as a last word, I want to apologize. We tried to keep our remarks brief. We didn't do a very good job of that, but I hope we gave you a lot of detail. We know we didn't leave a lot of time for Q&A. That's why we went over a bit, but we think it's important to get as many questions as we can. And of course, we'll speak to many of you offline. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to reporting on our progress as we go forward. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your lines, and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-03-17 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.  I would now like to turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.
Alexandra Lumpkin: Thank you, and good morning. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Lennar's business, financial conditions, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in yesterday's press release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption Risk Factors contained in Lennar's Annual Report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great, and good morning, and thank you, everyone. This morning, I am here in Miami as the world is seemingly beginning to normalize with the scale downs and still socially distance crew that includes Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, our now Vice President and Controller; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services; and, of course, Alex, who you just heard from; Rick Beckwitt, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-President is in Colorado and Jon Jaffe our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-President is in California and they are on the line this morning, as well.  So, today we have a lot of ground to cover. I’ll give a macro and strategic Lennar overview. Rick will talk about market strength, land and community count and Jon will update supply chain production and construction costs; and as usual Diane will give the detailed financial information highlights and additional guidance. Then we will attempt to answer as many questions as possible. As always, please limit your questions to one question per customer and one follow-up. So, from a macro perspective, the housing market remains strong. Demand has continued to strengthen as the millennial generation which had previously postponed its entry into the housing market has now continued to drive family formation, while at the same time the supply of new and existing home remains constrained.  Even though interest rates have moved higher, at the same time, the home prices have moved higher, overall affordability remains strong. Interest rates are still lower than they were a year ago and personal savings for deposits are strengthening. Many American families have fortified savings as vacations and recreational activities has been canceled or postponed and stimulus money from the government continues to fill the remaining gaps.  The American dream of home ownership is an essential aspiration of the American population and the seemingly imminent resolution of the pandemic is not slowing the growing demand. Apartment dwellers can today afford a first time home and demand is strong and growing. Yesterday’s first time homes are selling quickly and at higher prices enabling first time move ups.  The market for yesterday’s move up home is strong and enabling customers to consider the end purchase a larger home, with a larger yard, with an office, a nicer kitchen and a new set of necessary spaces for an evolving market.  Also the iBuyer and single-family for rent participants are providing additional liquidity to the marketplace to sell and purchase homes as they evolve and provide ever more frictionless transaction. The underproduction of homes for the past ten years has created a housing shortage and with strong demand home prices are moving higher.  Although this reality is exacerbating the well-documented affordability crisis across the country, as workforce housing is limited, and getting more expensive, the solution it seems will be in the growing supply – will be in growing supply by building more housing.  Current conditions have given rise to strong pricing power, strong well-controlled sales pace, certainly labor and material increases, very strong gross margins and even stronger net margins and of course the challenge of land scarcity.  In the context of overall market conditions, Lennar’s first quarter results reflect the intersection of our clearly stated strategic focus with excellent operational performance. Let me connect the dots. We have stated consistently that we would remain focused on orderly targeted growth and maintain our sales pace tightly matched with our space of production.  We actively managed growth at the top-line in favor of even greater growth at the bottom-line. We focused on gross margin by harvesting pricing power and controlling costs while building a better mousetrap as I’ve called it in order to reduce our SG&A. We have focused on cash flow, debt reduction and stock buyback, land owned versus controlled, return on capital and on equity and of course, innovative technologies.  All of this strategic focus shows through in our first quarter results. We grew our deliveries 19% year-over-year and grew revenues 18%, which drove a pretax income before extraordinary items to an increase of 95% year-over-year and an after-tax pre-extraordinary items income and EPS increase of 61%.  To achieve this, we have controlled sales pace and matched it with production. And while some have questioned our controlled and managed sales pace, the virtue of that strategy has been borne out by our 25% first quarter gross margin versus 20.5% last year.  At the same time, we’ve remained focused on improving our operating efficiency, driving our SG&A down to a first quarter all-time low of 8.4% versus 9.2% last year and driving our net margin to 16.6% this year versus 11.4% last year.  Alongside our homebuilding operation, our financial services group has continued to exceed all expectations as well. While some of the remarkable $146 million of earnings contribution from this segment is capital markets driven in today’s market environment, much of the consistent performance beat from this group continues to be driven by constant work and rework of the cost structure.  Lennar Financial Services continues to be a leader in the drive to create a better experience for our customers at a lower cost to transact. While operations have performed extremely well, we have also further improved our balance sheet. Rick will discuss our land program and our single-family for rent program, which will – which have – which continue to drive balance sheet improvements.  And just as you’ve seen dramatic improvement in other facets – in the other facets of our business, just in time delivery of land and just in time delivery of completed home enables us to be laser-focused on our inventory turn and we’ll be reporting on progress in that area in coming quarters.  Of course, all of our work has strategically focused attention on our returns on equity and returns on capital which have improved year-over-year by 470 and 420 basis points respectively and Diane will give more detail and our guidance in her comments.  So, moving on, in addition to the solid operating performance that we reported this quarter, we also had an extraordinary item of note. We have been talking about the strength of our LENx technology platform and this quarter, LENx requires some additional discussion.  Let me start by noting the remarkable contribution of Eric Feder and his team led by Sana Khan and Christian Falk at LENx. We have learned from scratch how to be a constructive, strategic investor in disruptive or adaptive technology companies through trial and error together with study and engagement and we have learned quite a lot.  This group has learned how to balance both the tip of the sphere and engaging best-of-breed entrepreneurs and innovators and the soft touch requires to engage and bridge change management together with our operating leaders within the company. Great work team.  With that said, last quarter, we day lighted that Opendoor, one of our many LENx technology business investments would begin trading as a public company and will require mark-to-market gain recognition. Accordingly, Opendoor is now a public company and we recorded a $470 million profit as a result. While this gain is extraordinary relative to our operating platform, it is not a one-time event for the company.  Through LENx, we have invested in a number of high quality technology businesses that are changing the way business is transacted in our company and in the housing business in general. Two more of our LENx investment companies, Doma previously known as States Title and Hippo Home Insurance have both announced pending spec combinations.  Additionally, as we have recently announced, our SunStreet Solar Power company will be acquired by Sunnova Energy. Given our ownership interest in these companies, and understanding that we might or might not qualify for mark-to-market accounting treatment, we are conservatively estimating an economic gain in excess of $1 billion from these companies.  Additionally, we believe that other companies in our technology portfolio will mature over time as well. While some have questioned the heat in the technology market space, our LENx investments are not driven by the one-time gains that might capture attention. Instead, our LENx investments are focused on best-of-breed management teams that are building solutions to important problems that are adjacent to our core homebuilding and financial services businesses.  These companies, their solutions and their form of execution are models for us to learn, participate with and reengineer our own operating platform for improved performance. Our investment focus prioritizes the return to our operating platform over our outsized return on our investment. Although the gains can be sizable, and positively impact our earnings and balance sheet, they are more importantly, indicative of the maturity and relevance of the underlying management and business.  And while they are subject to the up and down fluctuations that start market movements, the part of our investment that is not subject to market fluctuations is the permanent impact to our operating platform and company performance. Each of these companies have meaningfully impacted our core operating platforms.  Let me give some examples. Opendoor pioneer the high iBuyer space. We invested and participated in molding and evolving this business. We learn that the iBuyer space can reshape the entire home transaction, especially a move up transaction. As this solution continues to evolve and mature, the iBuyer sale will become an industry standard as seamless, trustworthy and times for the customers’ convenience become an expected way of transacting in the home buying world.  For Lennar, Opendoor ignited an internal digital marketing transformation that altered our entire customer acquisition and engagement. We both learned from them and then began to teach ourselves. We changed. And as a direct result, we significantly reduced SG&A by reducing selling, marketing and outside realtor cost and enabling better coordinated closing for us and for our purchasers.  Doma, formerly States Title is pioneering the instant digital home and mortgage closing. The conventional process of title insurance underwriting and traditional escrow closing is confusing to the customer, time consuming for lenders and time consuming for lenders, builders and customers alike. Doma, is simply working to reduce a 14-day work stream to 14 minutes by eliminating the traditional process, a buyer dashboard and seamless customer interface will effect in instant closing with one tap convenience.  This eliminates time and risk for the lenders, reduces complexity for the customer and reduces cost for all parties involved. Lennar became a shareholder in Doma by selling our retail title business for debt and equity in the company. Lennar’s retail platform and title underwriter became a springboard for Doma’s growth and evolution.  For Lennar, we simplified allowing our team to focus all of their attention on just our captive business. Our operation and overall operating cost will reduce significantly helping to drive Lennar Financial Services bottom-line.  Hippo Insurance has pioneered an instant and personalized home insurance product. Home insurance historically has required a detailed application process that resulted in a one size fits all overly expensive insurance policy. Hippo uses big data and technology together detailed information on each home, deliver a refined policy at a lower cost and with coverage for what matters most to the customer. The process is simple and frictionless.  Lennar invested in Hippo by joint venturing our captive home insurance agency and investing additional dollars over time. This investment enables us to participate in the development of the Hippo product for the new home market, add design elements to the home, like security by Ring and Flo by Moen Water Shutoff valve that lowers home insurance rates and design the engagement for the new home buyer.  Today, Hippo underwrites every Lennar home before the purchase. Our customer, simply are sent to hear from Hippo and they will get an immediate quote. Hippo has already done all the work. Lennar participates in the agency fee with no overhead and thus simplifying Lennar Financial Services once again and enhancing our bottom-line.  Finally, we recently announced that we will sell our SunStreet Solar operations to Sunnova in exchange for stock in the company. We’ve built the SunStreet platform to install solar panels on every Lennar home in certain markets where it was feasible. We built a blue chip team that excels the installation for production new homes as opposed to retrofit.  The SunStreet platform is readily expandable and we expect Sunnova will effectively grow that business. Lennar will benefit by simplifying our business and partnering with Sunnova to take standard solar installations and turning communities into micro grids with battery storage generators and advanced arbitrage technology.  We expect to develop next-generation energy solution for new homes and communities that will solve the problem of power outages and electric grid deficiencies for new communities. We look forward to working with the Sunnova team who specializes in this space to solve the critical problem of energy generation and distribution in an environmentally efficient manner.  Simply put, Lennar is a very different company. We are no longer just a homebuilding company with technology operating in the background. We are now a focused, technology aware and technology-engaged homebuilder that incorporates effective and new technology solutions to enhance our core operation and our product offering.  We invest in technology companies and professionals. We worked alongside them to develop products for our industry. We incorporate new ways of doing business and we profit as well by investing in world-class innovators and entrepreneurs that help illuminate our path forward.  To the investor world, we would not make the case that a higher EPS from non-operating income or loss for that matter should be used with our multiple to value our company. But instead, I would make the case and will make the case over time for multiple expansions as our focus on cash flow and returns, together with an improving operating platform with embedded upside from strategic investments merits considerations. Now, before I turn over to Rick, let me briefly turn to our ancillary business divisions and our drive to focus on our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. We have continued to drive and grow our excellent ancillary business division and they continue to mature. But being simpler, enables us to focus on our core business units ever more.  As noted in past conference calls, we have been working on strategies to better position our multi-family business called LMC, along with our now maturing SFR or Single-Family for Rent business that Rick will talk about in a minute.  Additionally, we have a dynamic and growing land program and land management business. We have also LMF, Lennar Mortgage Finance, our commercial mortgage business, another excellent business. And finally, we have a growing technology investment business which is part of LENx. We’ve concluded that the best way to enhance corporate value is to have Lennar standalone as a pure play homebuilder and financial services company and to enable these blue chip businesses to thrive and excel independently.  Therefore, we are working to construct a tax free spin-off of all or parts of these ongoing businesses in a unified company. This Spinco may contain all or part of the assets of these businesses together with certain land assets and programs, as well as part of our LENx investment business. The expected size of the spun enterprise would be between $3 billion and $5 billion in asset base with no debt, which our balance sheet can comfortably accommodate.  The remaining Lennar would see almost no loss of operating income from this spin-off and will continue to have a very liquid balance sheet. The standalone company would ultimately drive income from significant asset management fees. The Spinco will be focused on building an active asset management business that raises third-party capital to support ongoing business verticals included in land – including land development.  The company will become an active asset and property management company. The backbone for the company will be LMC’s operating platform together with the LMV structures. This resolution is no longer a long-term strategy, but it is immediate as we focus on driving higher return with less noise in our numbers from lumpy profits and losses, which will increase visibility for the capital markets into our core operations.  Expect to hear a lot more about the spin over the next quarters as our thinking matures. Today, we can only give a brief sketch of the future of this program. I know you will thirst for more detail, but we are not in a position to give it at this time. But we did feel that it was time to share our thinking with the investment world as we work to fill out the detail and build a new company.  So, in conclusion, let me say that our results and our expectations for the year are solid in all respects and they reflect our focused strategy to balance growth and drive bottom-line margin, cash flow and returns. But complementing our business performance, we continue to be focused – to focus on our broader mission of making the world around us even better, whether it’s with our social focus on extending home ownership to a broader social and economic array of customers with our emerging single-family for rent program, which Rick will discuss shortly, or our $1,000 per home that we contribute to our Lennar Foundation for social, health and educational programs across the country or our solar initiative for better and more sustainable energy for our homes, we are positioned to do well, but always focused on doing good.  At Lennar, we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally, culturally, and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market.  With that, let me turn over to Rick. 
Rick Beckwitt : Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart’s opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well-coordinated and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies.  Key to that has been running a finely tuned homebuilding machine, where we carefully match homebuilding starts with sales on a community-by-community basis. In this environment, it makes no sense to sell too far out ahead, because you lose the ability to offset potential cost increases with sales price increases.  Our first quarter results prove out the success of this strategy. In the quarter, both new orders and starts were up 26% over the prior year, enabling an orderly construction program and a just in time delivery of completed homes. This sales and production-focused program allowed us to drive a 450 basis point improvement in our gross margins year-over-year, with strong results in each months of the quarter.  In the first quarter, new orders, deliveries, gross margins were up strongly in each of our operating regions. In addition, we saw strength in all product categories, from entry-level, to move-up, to our active adult communities. The strength of the market was also reflected in a historically low cancellation rate, which was 9.6% in the quarter, down 450 basis points from last year.  This is additional evidence that buyers have the required downpayment and mortgage qualifications to purchase a new home and they have little desire to risk canceling their new home purchase due to the risk of rising sales prices. As Stuart mentioned, technology-driven innovation and a focus on process has significantly lowered our SG&A. This has been reflected in each of our operating regions with net margins up across the board in every region.  Now, I’d like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. As expected, our community count at the end of the first quarter was down 8% from the prior year. Notwithstanding the 8% decline, we achieved a 26% increase in new orders in the first quarter, driven by a 45% increase in sales per community.  While part of the increase in absorption pace was driven by improved market conditions, part of it was due to the fact that we have been targeting larger, higher volume entry-level communities that can deliver more homes per month than smaller communities. In the next several quarters, our growth will continue to come from an overall higher absorption phase, as well as an increase in community count, and we are still on track to increase our active communities by about 10% in fiscal 2021 with the increase coming in the back half of the year.  While we continue to be focused on our community count, we are intensely focused on replacing our existing communities with larger, higher volume communities as this allows us to better leverage our overhead, improve our bottom-line and increase our returns and cash flow.  As I’ve mentioned on prior calls, improving our returns on capital and reducing our balance sheet - our on-balance sheet investment in land is a top priority. With that in mind, we have been laser-focused on increasing our percentage of auction home sites and reducing our year’s supply of owned home sites, all while increasing our overall home site supply.  During the first quarter, we made significant process on all of these fronts, as our controlled home site the percentage increased 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially to end the first quarter at 45%.  In addition, our years owned supply of home sites dropped to 3.4 years from four years in the year ago period and 3.5 years sequentially. Most importantly, we increased our total controlled and owned home sites by approximately 37,000 home sites in the quarter, with approximately 95% of these being auctioned or controlled home sites. Based on this progress, we are in excellent position to achieve our goals of 50% controlled home sites and a three-year owned supply by the end of fiscal 2021. These improvements reflect the strength of our relationships with local developers and other strategic partners. We have been building a just-in-time delivery system for our land inventory that we believe is sustainable throughout the cycles.  We’ve created relationships with developers and investors with appetites for different duration of risk for land and have matched that duration risk with appropriate risk-adjusted returns. These short-term land and long-term land programs will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, while generating strong margins and increased returns on capital. Consistent with our land light strategy and a focus on increased profitability and returns, we are excited to expand our business through the creation of a first-of-its-kind, single-family rental platform that will facilitate a better time delivery of our homes with reduced cycle times.  Following this earnings call, we will formally announce the formation of the Upward America venture. This business will initially be capitalized with a total equity commitment of $1.25 billion led by Centerbridge Partners, alongside Allianz Real Estate and other high-quality institutional investors.  Including leverage, the venture will be positioned to acquire over $4 billion of new single-family homes and townhomes from Lennar. We expect Lennar’s peak capital investment to be $50 million in the Upward America venture. This venture is uniquely positioned to quickly scale, given its direct access to Lennar’s pipeline of both purpose-built single-family communities and scattered single-family homes that meet the venture’s investment criteria.  The initial pipeline of purpose-built communities for this venture includes approximately 3,000 homes in 27 communities with a total purchase price of approximately $900 million. Like our multi-family build to core business, this platform will be asset managed by Lennar with third-party equity and debt owning the assets in an asset-light program for Lennar. As housing needs and demographics continue to evolve, we believe that the single-family rental sector will continue to outperform. In addition, the Upward America venture continues Lennar’s vision of becoming an ESG-driven homebuilding company by making our high-quality homes not only available for sale, but also for rent with a portion of the homes available with a rent-to-own option.  The vehicle’s social focus provides a unique opportunity for families and individuals across the country to live in brand new Lennar homes at an attainable price point, all without putting up a downpayment. Given this, we have a distinct opportunity to create upward mobility in the housing market through this initiative. Now, I’d like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick and Stuart noted, matching sales pace with our production pace has been our consistent strategic focus that has enabled us to drive excellent performance. By pairing production and sales, we’ve maximized margins and driven bottom-line profitability.  In the current environment, we could have easily generated more sales, but our view has been and remains that the key to success in this market is all about managing the supply chain and production.  I’d like to briefly describe our strategy, performance and expectations for production and construction costs in order to shed some light on how this strategy has been central to our accomplishments this quarter and how it impact the balance of 2021. First, let me share with you some statistics from our first quarter. Our total construction cost per square foot was down 0.7% in Q1 year-over-year, but up 1.9% sequentially from the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, lumber costs increased about $1 per square foot or $2,300 per home, both year-over-year and sequentially.  These cost increases were more than offset by other cost decreases year-over-year, but not sequentially, resulting in the overall year-over-year cost decline and sequential cost increase. Year-over-year, our construction cost, as a percent of average sales price decreased from 45% to 42% and remained flat sequentially as our pricing power, driven by our controlled sales pace, offset cost increases seen in our first quarter deliveries. Let me take a moment to discuss the situation of lumber and other supply chain challenges. As we all know, lumber is the largest component – largest cost component of new home construction. It is well documented that the cost of lumber is at all-time highs and supply is limited and demand is high.  We will see additional cost increases from lumber throughout the year, with increases from today’s all-time high lumber pricing starting with Q3 deliveries. Given the unprecedented pricing levels we’ve seen, it’s challenging to predict how lumber prices will trend, but we’re encouraged by the additional OSB capacity currently coming online and the lumber future market indicating some relief.  The overall production environment today is defined by a supply chain limited to no excess inventory. Normally, the manufacturers that supply our industry carry 30 to 60 days of inventory and are able to adjust distribution to meet varying demand.  However, due to COVID-19 disruptions and manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico and overseas in 2020, that capacity has, at best been dramatically reduced and at worst eliminated. At the same time, demand has increased from both new home construction and big box retailers.  This situation makes the supply chain particularly vulnerable to further disruptions, such as the deep freeze that struck Texas last month. That storm shut down the plants that manufacture MDI and poly-based resins impacting the manufacturing of OSB, paint, insulation, refrigerators and other products. We are working closely with all of these effective manufacturers to ensure that we have the products we need being delivered to our job sites as we need them.  To manage for these disruptions and the supply chain of materials, as well as to be the builder of choice in a continually constrained labor market, we employ the following strategies and processes. First, we remain disciplined about our Everything’s Included approach, which simplifies the entire building process for our trades. We shared data by providing frequent forecast and open purchase order information.  We simplified by rationalizing SKUs across multiple categories. We access alternative supply chain solutions and aggressively pre-buy materials as needed. Most importantly, we communicate. Our trade partners know well in advance of our upcoming production needs.  Our divisions know the extended manufacturing lead times in real-time and our national supply chain team, led by Kemp Gillis, together with our retail purchasing VPs, are in constant communication with each other, our divisions and all of our trade partners.  I would best describe the production environment as challenged, but manageable. In the first quarter, we saw a mild increase in our cycle time as we dealt with resolving issues as they presented themselves and through our strong supply chain partnerships, we were largely able to overcome supply constraints. Our highest volume partners have given us expanded lead times, which we were able to accommodate due to our production first model where our needs are forecasted several quarters out. We believe we are well positioned with our disciplined and production-first process to continue to manage through new challenges as they present themselves. Our focus on these processes is why we are comfortable affirming our deliveries for the year.  However, this environment is not easily stressed to allow for an increase in deliveries. So our focus is on maintaining our planned starts, deliveries and maximizing margins.  In conclusion, Lennar’s strategy of a managed approach to production and sales pace produced great results in our first quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, we are confident that our gross margins will remain around 25% and will drive our SG&A lower producing higher net margins and a stronger bottom-line, while maintaining our planned volume. And now, I’ll turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette : Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Although, you’ve heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I’ll begin by recapping certain of our Q1 2021 highlights and then provide detailed guidance for Q2 2021 and high-level guidance for fiscal year 2021.  So we’ll start with homebuilding. For new orders, we ended the quarter with new orders of 15,570, a 26% increase year-over-year. While this was the highest new order total for a quarter in our history, we continued to be focused on production first matching sales and starts. In the first quarter, our starts were 15,982, also up 26% year-over-year.  From a pace standpoint, our monthly sales pace was 4.5 for the quarter matching our monthly start pace of 4.6 for the quarter. We ended the quarter with 22,077 homes in backlog with a dollar value of $9.5 billion and ended with 1,162 active communities. Our cancellation rate was about 10%.  For the quarter, deliveries totaled 12,314, up 19% year-over-year. Our gross margin was 25%, up 450 basis points from the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by a continued focus on attaining price increases while controlling and matching cost increases.  In addition, we also had lower interest expense per home as a result of our continued paydowns of senior notes in the past several years and lower field expense per home due to our higher delivery volume. Our SG&A was 8.4%, down 80 basis points from the prior year. This improvement is primarily a result of our intense focus on incorporating technology to gain efficiencies across our homebuilding platform.  Our net margin for the quarter was 16.6%, the highest first quarter net margin ever achieved. Our Financial Services team also executed at high levels reporting $146 million of operating earnings.  Mortgage operating earnings increased to $100 million, compared to $41 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited primarily from an increase in volume and lower cost per loan, combined with an increase in secondary margins. Title operating earnings was $31 million, compared to $10 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily due to an increase in volume. We also started to realize upside from our technology – from our strategic technology investments in our Lennar Other segment. As Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a $470 million mark-to-market gain on our Opendoor investment as a result of the company going public in December. The gain was based on Opendoor’s stock price at the end of our first quarter, which was $28.02.  This investment will be mark-to-market at each quarter end based on Opendoor’s stock price at that time. I also want to mention that we have a new line item on our P&L titled Charitable Foundation Contribution, which is the contribution to our Lennar Foundation. Previously, our annual contribution to the foundation was 1% of net income. Beginning with this year 2021, we will be increasing our contribution to $1,000 per home delivered. And so, just for a bit of perspective using fiscal 2020 numbers, our net income last year was about $2.5 billion, which resulted in a contribution of about $25 million. If we had contributed at $1,000 per home level, our contribution would have been about $53 million. So the increase is significant and we are very pleased and very proud to be able to give back even more to our communities, doing good while we do well.  And then turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. We continued to focus on our strategy to become asset lighter by developing a just-in-time delivery system for land and homes, improving returns and generating increased homebuilding cash flow. At quarter end, we owned 189,000 home sites and controlled 154,000 home sites. This resulted in our years supply owned decreasing to 3.4 years from 4.0 years in the prior year, and our home sites controlled increasing to 45% from 31% in the prior year. We continue to make progress, as Rick mentioned, in reaching our goal of three year supply owned and 50% home sites controlled by the end of the year.  During the quarter, we repurchased a small amount of shares, 510,000 for a total of just $43 million. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt-to-total cap was 24%, down from 33.6% in the prior year.  And just a few final points on our balance sheet, our stockholders’ equity increased to approximately $19 billion from $16 billion in Q1 of the prior year and our book value per share increased to $60.30 from $51.39 in the prior year.  And finally, just a few weeks ago, we were upgraded by Fitch to BBB flat from BBB minus. This upgrade follows the upgrade to investment grade from Moody’s that we received last November. We are quite pleased with the rating agency advances that we have achieved in recent months.  So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong. This balance sheet enables us to execute a spinoff and even after that transaction, we will have a rock solid balance sheet.  And with that brief overview, let’s turn to guidance. I’ll first provide detailed guidance for the second quarter and then some high level guidance for the fiscal year. So we’ll start with homebuilding. We expect Q2 new orders to be in the range of 16,500 to 16,700 homes and our Q2 deliveries will be in the range of 14,200 to 14,400 homes. Our Q2 average sales price should be around $405,000.  As we mentioned, we expect to maintain our gross margin at about 25% for Q2 despite rising material and labor costs. We expect our Q2 SG&A to be in the range of 7.9% to 8%, as we continue to focus on benefiting from technology efficiencies and for the combined category of homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other we expect a Q2 loss in the range of about $5 million to $10 million. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q2 will be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. For our multi-family operations, we expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million and for the Lennar Other category we also expect a loss in the range of $5 million to $10 million. Now remember that this guidance for Lennar Other does not include any potential mark-to-market gains on our Hippo or States Title, Doma investment.  We have not yet concluded if we will be able to utilize mark-to-market accounting for these investments, and if we do, the gain will be determined by the stock price of each company at the end of our second quarter. Additionally, this guidance does not include any potential adjustments to our current Opendoor investments since this too will be determined by the stock price of Opendoor at the end of our second quarter. And lastly the guidance does not include a gain related to the sale of our SunStreet Solar Company since the shares that we will receive as consideration will be valued at Sunnova’s closing price on the day that the transaction closes. We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenue and as I mentioned, our charitable foundation contribution will be based on $1,000 per home delivered during the quarter.  We expect our tax rate to be about 24.5%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 311 million shares. And so, when you pull all those together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.25 to $2.35 per share for the quarter.  And so now let me provide some guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect to deliver between 62,064 homes, but with now higher gross margin guidance of about 25% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.6% to 7.8% for the year and we believe our average sales price for the year will be about $400,000 and our Financial Services earnings will be in the range of $445 million to $460 million and finally, our tax rate should be about 24%.  And so as we continue to execute our core operating strategy, maintain a very strong balance sheet and remain focused on cash flow generation and returns, we are well positioned for another excellent year. And so with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. 
Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Wow! A lot of detail on the call and Stuart, I feel like you are abating me to ask a question about the Spinco, but I am going to refrain for now. So, first question on the gross margin guidance, you all bumped it up to 25%.  That implies flat sequentially throughout the year when normally we see sequential improvement due to leverage as we move through the year. Could you just let us know what your expectations are for land, labor, material inflation is as we move through the year? And does this imply since it’s flat gross margin through the year?  Does this imply that some of your internal efficiencies are starting to level off or pricing you assume is cooling? Just walk us through some of the moving parts there please. 
Stuart Miller: Well, let me just start as Rick and Jon collect their thoughts on that question. But just remember, Truman, that our guidance on margin was pretty consistent through the year at between 23.5% to 24-ish percent and so we are upping our guidance. It was flat through the year recognizing that along the way and through the year some of the construction cost would rise and would pull through at different parts of the year.  So, this is consistent with how we were thinking at the beginning of the year in terms of the way the year would shape up even with as you say the leverage embedded in increased volume as you go quarter-by-quarter. So, what you are seeing is, significant improvement that we are reflecting in each quarter’s results. Jon, Rick, do you want to add some color to the way that margin is shaping up? 
Jon Jaffe: Sure. This is Jon. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, lumber rates is the biggest mover on the cost side of the equation and we’ll see in Q2 more of its impact from lumber prices as they were striking like October of 2020.  And so, I said we have about a $2300 per home increase in our lumber cost in Q1 that will go up by another $4,000, $5,000 per home as we move into Q2 and then, in Q3 and Q4 we will see a repeat of that pattern as lumber prices move higher in the recent months before what we hope would be an expected leveling off.  So, as all that had mentioned, we’ve got significant pricing power that’s overcoming that big needle mover of the lumber cost increases that’s just the reflection of where the lumber market is, not something that any of us can do anything about until that the market itself corrects. And then, as I mentioned, we are seeing other cost increases, other categories there is supply constraints and increased demand. So natural supply and demand is occurring in the supply chain. 
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I think that Stuart and Jon have covered it, I view this as – would bump overall year guidance by 125 basis points. So, we feel that that’s a really big increase from a quarter. 
Truman Patterson : Yes. I would agree with that. And apologies, if I missed. I missed the first part of the call. So apologies if I ask something that was covered earlier on, but clearly it sounds like demand is healthy, but on the flip side, are you seeing any demand softening with the recent increase in rates and I am trying to link this to your 2Q orders guide.  It seems like it’s below what we would expect seasonally, right, sequentially. Is this just you all are comfortable running your mousetrap at this level and you are fine with demand outstripping supply or are you concerned of the market softening near-term? And with that your guidance was about 16.6000 orders or starts I would estimate, is that the level that you all are comfortable you can produce going forward? 
Stuart Miller: Rick? 
Rick Beckwitt: So, as Jon said in his commentary, we could have sales whatever we wanted, the market is extremely strong in all price and product categories and what we’ve really been focused on is matching starts with sales and making sure that we are maximizing our bottom-line through operating efficiencies.  And we’ve looked at what some of the other builders have done in selling so far out ahead and without the ability to match a price increase to cover up cost that may be potentially command it just doesn’t make business sense for us. So we are sticking to our plan and feel very good about what we’ve laid out for you. 
Stuart Miller: Yes. Look, we are managing a carefully controlled business and that you’ve heard some of the earnings calls and our commentary today we have a number of moving parts in the company. We’ve been focusing on balancing margin and bottom-line and cash flow and really building that rock solid balance sheet. I know that you hesitated and I ask everyone to hesitate in asking questions about the spin, but the balance sheet is really the key to spinning and leading both companies with rock solid balance sheet.  And all of this comes about through carefully managed program of matching starts, production and sales and keeping them in orderly relationship to each other and that’s exactly what you’ve seen from the company as we map out our strategy for going forward. Next question? 
Truman Patterson : Thank you. 
Stuart Miller: You bet. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. 
Stephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much guys. You’ve certainly been busy. Good to see and we’ll be looking forward to a lot more information coming forward. I did want to ask you generally though, about LENx, which I understand is LEN to the x power.  But I see two potential approaches and I am curious which is more the priority for you, which is really more the emphasis to the sort of driving your decision-making or will drive your decision-making Lennar LENx.  One would be to create a separate operating segment of sorts in order to have a collection of businesses be more easily valuable by the street, literally able to be valued more easily. But then another alternative will be to that you want to create an ecosystem - an ecosystem of tech-enabled businesses that a customer enters into when they walk into one of your sales centers or one of your rental offices, in order to sort of maximize the value that you can both provide and get compensated for by that customer. And I am wondering which was more the priority or is the more priority in your mind?  And then, as a follow-up, do we consider, should we consider these initiatives to be cash flow positive or negative meaningfully over the next few years at all? 
Stuart Miller: So, fair questions Steve. Our primary focus is building LENx and it has been evolutionary. It has been the latter approach. It was and continues to be all about in the background of our core business we inject these new streams of activity that are enabling a better customer experience and better cost structure for our company.  I’ve called it and said it’s building a better mousetrap. And if you think about the companies we’ve talked about over time, you could imagine that a customer walks in and says they’ve got a home to sell, we’ve got a solution it’s the iBuyer space that leads right into a blend powered mortgage application, which is a seamless simpler, technology-enabled mortgage application feeding right into Doma and the entire closing process being one tap and digitized and an immediate home insurance policy.  It becomes a joyful experience with our technology companies operating in the background creating an excellent experience for our customer but driving our cost structure down and enabling us to build profitability and even pass on some of those savings to our customer, which is a greater good. And I haven’t really mentioned that each of our technology company has an ESG component and focus as well and that will develop over time.  So, really think about it as we are building a better Lennar by investing in these technology companies and the investment in the technology company we are not really isolating and looking at as a separate operating business and I would – I just want to daylight that Eric Feder and his team Sana Khan, Christian Falk and a number of others have really developed some expertise in creating a focus on technology companies that matter together with changed management dovetailed within the company.  And I think that over time, what you are going to see is these companies develop their own value proposition as you’ve already started to see, they do become cash flow positive in their own right and each of them has a map to that strategy and the dovetail with Lennar and the operating performance is what gets us very enthusiastic.  So, we are more focused on the latter approach than we are on the former and we really want to deemphasize what I call the shiny object of the big games and I want to emphasize more the core program that Rick is involved in, Jon is involved in, Eric is involved, I am involved in every single day of building a better company, that’s what it’s really about. 
Stephen Kim: That’s great. Thanks a lot for that, Stuart. Appreciate it. The second thing I wanted to ask about relates to this land venture which you talked a little bit about in your 10-K and you talked a little bit about today. Rick, I believe you spoke to the idea that this would be creating a structure by which you can basically bucket land parcels into various categorizing and to put them into buckets with different durations and different returns on capital expectations.  In a way though, that’s kind of what you’ve always been doing, right, I mean, I humble there is always what they are doing things properly are sort of evaluating parcels of land to for duration and returns on capital expectations and so forth. So, is what different here that you’ve got some form of a system that enables you to do that more quickly by isolating specific metrics or something.  I don’t want to put words in your mouth, because I’ll probably get it wrong. But can you – but to the degree that there is already that discipline that existed in Lennar previously. Can you zero in on exactly what is different and special about this particular relationship and venture? 
Stuart Miller: Let me start off and I’ll let Jon follow. Steve, you are right. We have always done what we thought we could to maximize the land opportunities out there, whether they be short-term or long-term. I think the key difference associated with this is we’ve created something that’s very programmatic and systemized and oriented where we are matching capital and returns to either short dated and long dated land opportunities.  And what we’ve learned as we’ve evolved our thinking over the last several years is that, there is tremendous appetite out there in the market for risk-adjusted returns. And the returns associated with the short-term sort of current inventory type of opportunities gives a much lower threshold in something that is a little bit riskier.  And by creating a programmatic systemized machine, where we funnel our land opportunities to either one of these programmatic structures, it allows us to become very efficient and to really incredibly scalar the land opportunities out there to grow our business. So, Jon, anything you want to add to that? 
Jon Jaffe: Yes. That perhaps the fine tuning of what we’ve always done has been to further define the risk buckets associated with land. So if you think about the least risky component that’s the land in which we are building homes on and that’s going to be financed at the low cost of capital and primarily our cash on hand and revolver.  And then, if you look at the next bucket that you call the land that is more like whip the day they come into that production assembly line, that’s say zero to four year ago, that is properly structured relatively very low risk and should attract a cost of capital that is also very low and separated from a mid-term bucket of land which is historically looked for high teens to 20% kind of returns from an investment standpoint.  And by properly structuring and really reducing the significant portion of risk associated with that middle bucket, we are able to create, as Rick said, a more of a systemic approach and that a significant size and scale to it allowing to a one stop facility to be able to make it very easy to transact and to really position land to be derisked. 
Stephen Kim: Great. I appreciate. I am sure we’ll be hearing more about this as we go forward. But thanks a lot guys. And good luck and good job with everything so far. 
Stuart Miller: Steve, let me just say, before you get off, that it’s really a just in time delivery system for land that we are building. But I love the fact that the question is coming from you and I reminisce about you, me, David Dewey are sitting in my old office going through this kind of tranched, risk reward association relative to CMBS probably 25 years ago. And here we are going through that same thinking process again as it relates to another asset class. 
Stephen Kim: Yes, indeed and I imagine that the returns from this might even be greater than what you saw in the early 90s from the other one which was pretty meaningful as well. 
Stuart Miller: Well, we did okay with that that this will be very interesting. Okay, thank you. 
Stephen Kim: Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open. 
Buck Horne: Hi. Thank you for the time and quite a bit of news to digest. But thank you so much for going through it. Let me back it out to just a more of a higher level and kind of policy type question for you. We are hearing a little bit more chatter coming out of DC that there is some renewed consideration of the President Biden’s proposal for a $15,000 first-time buyer tax credit and among some other things out there.  But I am just wondering what your thoughts might be on how a tax credit like that could affect the current housing market with the benefit outweigh the cost and do you see any other policy options that might be more supportive to increasing housing supply at these levels? 
Stuart Miller: So, look, the last thing I think we should be weighing on this politics basis, no question that stimulus is a significant part of the equation. As I’ve noted in my remarks, interest rates are still low by all measures. Yes, they ticked up a little bit, but the other side of the equation is the savings rate and the stimulus that’s out there just in the most recent stimulus build.  Additional legislation seems to be coming down the track and that will once again stimulate even more demand. The complicating part is that we are dealing more with supply shortage than we are dealing with the shortage of demand with the fact this demand is very, very strong and a tax credit to stimulate more demand, it seems it is probably going to layer on more demand to an already constrained supply which will probably have the impact of raising prices somewhat just supply and demand imbalance.  So, the question is, what do you do across a country that is talking about workforce housing and short supply as a governing kind of component. And it seems that there is going to have to be some additional initiative to focus on more land entitlement, more streamlined government involvement in constraining the supply.  But we’ll have to see how it all shakes out. As things sit right now, when we look at the housing market, it’s one of the reasons that we think that for the next years, the housing market benefits from a fairly strong supply limitation and demand strength – strong demand and shorter supply. And for the homebuilders, we are going to have to be an active participant in finding reconciliation here and participating in building new homes. 
Buck Horne: Great. Thank you so much for that. Let me follow-up with a question on the single-family rental platform, this new strategy. There is a lot of details to cover there. So, just for clarification, would Lennar be a exclusive builder to this new SFR venture? What’s the – I think what’s the initial timeline to ramp up deliveries to this venture and were the returns or margins on these would be similar to the for sale product?
Stuart Miller: So, a bunch of questions there. The duration of the venture is a 12 year period. It has a four year investment period. The venture is not exclusive to Lennar, although our partners in the venture are very comfortable with Lennar product and it’s been geared towards its behind our new homes. And so what was the last part of your question? 
Buck Horne: Just, were the returns and margins on built for rent product be similar to for sale? 
Stuart Miller: Yes. So, let me say that, this is primarily a focused program on Lennar products. We have the ability within the program to buy other builders’ product as well. But think of it is primarily focused on a new build program that is going to be basically opening the ability to purchase across Lennar’s platform.  That’s the exciting part of this program is the ability to ramp up. We have already started buying homes into this program even though the ink is just drying on the Centerbridge led financing component we had start on this program and started buying homes.  We’ll be ramping up pretty considerably over the next year and you can expect that our margins are going to be exactly in line with the margins on the rest of our products. So there will be no pullback or compromise in that regard. 
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, and consistent with Stuart’s comments on technology and visibility, this business allows the venture to have complete visibility across our pipeline to make it very seamless for them to transact with Lennar. So, it’s …
Stuart Miller: Let me just say one more thing. One of the things it has got most enthusiastic about this program is the social component. This is an upward mobility program. It produces access across Lennar’s landscape to a broader array of social and economic participants in our communities and really stretches and gives a single-family lifestyle access to a much broader array of the population.  Now that’s the case for single-family for rent in general, but notably, in this program, we have a component of our program that is dedicated to and focused on lease with an option to buy and we are really focused on finding a way to not only create accessibility to our single-family homes in our single-family for rent program, but also to engage more people and the ability over time to find their way to home ownership which we think is a greater good.  So, this is an exciting program for the company and I think ultimately for the industry and we designed it to be ultimately an industry solution, as well. 
Buck Horne: Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. 
Stuart Miller: You bet. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is open. 
Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning everybody. 
Stuart Miller: Good morning. 
Carl Reichardt : I think to ask one so you can get someone else here, but Rick or Stuart of whoever, Jon, can you talk about how mix has changed in terms of entry level versus first time move up or even down to next-gen? you mentioned that folks are looking for larger homes now, more space and I am interested if your community count has it changes over the year is going to address that if you are seeing more demand for higher end home now compared to, say six months ago when entry level was a big driver? 
Stuart Miller: Jon, Rick. 
Jon Jaffe: Look, it’s Jon here. I’d say that we are seeing consistent demand across our platforms. So, it’s – you still have tremendous drive for the more affordable homes as people come out of apartments and are able to access home ownership for the first time driven in a large part as we discussed by historically low interest rates.  But we see it throughout to our next-gen, probably as you mentioned which is a phenomenal solution for those looking for a home that’s better suited for working at home, playing at home, educating at home, as well as the need for multi-generational families as America continues to age. We are seeing continued demand or new demand in our active go product line.  But if you look at our square footage, which is average at first quarter about 2300 square feet per home, it’s really maintained a very constant level. So, even though we have had a shift towards more first-time affordable product in our overall mix and you can see the impact of the demand for larger homes really balancing out our average square footage across the entire platform. 
Rick Beckwitt: And maybe in addition to what Jon said, consistent as to what we’ve said in prior calls, we are very focused on expanding our entry level market share. And that’s what’s been driving our sales prices down on a consolidated basis, notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing pricing power in that segment. We are really focused on higher returns, higher volume in our entry-level and first time move up communities. 
Carl Reichardt : Alright. Thanks, a lot Rick. Thanks, Jon. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open. 
Alan Ratner: Hi guys, good afternoon. It’s actually Alan on for Ivy. Congrats on all of the exciting things going on and the great performance. 
Stuart Miller: Thanks, Jon. 
Alan Ratner: My first question I think, a lot’s been discussed about all the ancillary businesses. So, I’ll probably leave that to the side for now, but just in terms of the home – the core homebuilding side, I thought it was interesting last week we saw an announcement from the GSEs about actually capping the percentage of second homes and investment properties that they are going to be buying.  And I am pretty sure that’s the first real example of tightening on the mortgage side we’ve seen in a while and I know it’s a small part of the business. But I am curious, have you looked at what impact that might have on your business, what percentage of your sales today are the second home owners or investment property owners? And just kind of curious if that differs across your footprint.
Bruce Gross : Sure. Good morning, Alan. This is Bruce. I’ll take that question. We are running somewhere in the 8% range and limitation they talked about was 7%. So what that means is, we’ll look to the private market to sell those loans as opposed to the GSEs. So, the impact might be a little bit on the margin side within financial services. But we’ll still be able to go ahead and off of those loans. We’ll just be selling them elsewhere. 
Alan Ratner: Got it. Very helpful, Bruce. Good to hear your voice. 
Bruce Gross : Likewise. 
Alan Ratner: The second question I guess is on the land side. Obviously, tying up a lot of land there and I think you made the comment about looking towards larger communities. So, you can kind of keep a higher sales pace going on.  Can you provide any additional color about the underwriting on the land you’ve tied up over the last year and how that might differ from land prior to the pandemic, whether that quantifying the number of lots per community, absorption rates that you are assuming going forward, margins and implied margins on that, any color you can give would be great. 
Stuart Miller: Rick? 
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. So, from an underwriting standpoint, we are pretty much consistent with where we’ve been in prior time periods with the exception of coming out of the downturn where there was a lot of distress out there.  From an underwriting standpoint, we are really not focused on underwriting inflation. We are staying very close to where the markets are with regard to sales prices and pace. We have a lot of metrics right now with regard to what current activity is. And as Stuart, I and Jon talked about really matching duration risk to risk-adjusted return for the various programmatic structures we’ve got. 
Jon Jaffe: That’s about is we have an intense focus because of our production first strategy to looking for land that fits existing product that we build. So we can maximize the release of products which really great efficiencies throughout the system as you could imagine for us internally and all of our trade partners. 
Alan Ratner: Gotcha. So, just to clarify on the absorption comment, because I think you said, you are kind of looking at today’s absorption. So, is this 4.5 per month range that you are kind of running at is that the right way to think about how you anticipate the pace staying over the next X number of years as these projects come online, because that’s obviously much higher than the cycle average? I am just curious if there is any haircut being implied there on the new land? 
Rick Beckwitt: As we look at land in general, absorption pace actually changes depending on the community and what we’ve found is in our larger communities, we can have multiple product lines going at any point in time. So the pace is a bit higher. But we are not forecasting across the board a 4.5 over the next several years. It’s really geared to what the land opportunity is and the drivers of the local market there. 
Stuart Miller: Let me just say that, I think that we’ve noted that we could tune up or down the actual sales pace in any of our communities right now. Demand is just that strong and has been that strong. In terms of underwriting, we tend to conservatize that sales pace recognizing that we can get away with ourselves if we start anticipating that it’s much higher.  So we really haven’t – we haven’t tuned up the sales pace that we could achieve it and we are probably underwriting to something closer to a 4 even though we are running at 4.5 right now. And so, and maybe that gives some guidelines as to how we are thinking about land. 
Alan Ratner: Yes. That’s very helpful. I appreciate that that extra color. Great guys. Good luck. 
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you. And why don’t we take one more question? 
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, Mike. 
Michael Rehaut: Thanks for squeezing me in. And I think this is the second time I got the squeeze in before the door closes. So I appreciate it. 
Stuart Miller: We’ll have to make you first next time. 
Michael Rehaut: I won’t agree with that. 
Stuart Miller: Noted. 
Michael Rehaut: Stuart, and team, obviously appreciate all the detail and results. I wanted to ask two quick questions. One, operationally on the homebuilding side and one, see if there is any way to squeeze out a couple more numbers on the spin. On the sales pace side, in particular, you guys have been very consistent in your approach to managing pace and where possible for us getting little bit more on the margin side.  And I think that strategy really comes home in an environment today where rates are rising which everything else equal would lower the true – when I am kind of referring to recently is, theoretical level of demand, because certainly as you said, your sales pace is below that level, you could run a lot hotter if you choose.  And so, in that type of dynamic you would think that if rates going higher impair overall market demand, but you are running below that, you should be able to still maintain a pretty steady business and a pretty steady order inflow.  So, obviously, we are just in the initial stages of this rate rise, but I was wondering if that theory is accurate in that over the last throughout the first quarter, particularly, February and into March, given again that you could have run off harder in other words, below true market demand that the recent move in rates really hasn’t impacted you at all from a – from the order cadence?
Stuart Miller: So, look, I think, Mike, the way to think about it is, I think that there tends to be a need that interest rates move up and the homebuilders are going to have sales turmoil and that might be conventional with them. But in today’s market, as I’ve noted, there are offsets to the movement in interest rates. First of all interest rates have – are moving from a historically – abnormally low rate.  We are still lower than we were a year ago. Interest rates are still low. But the offset is the fact that the savings rate in the country has really enabled so many more people to be able to afford a downpayment. The increase in home prices is, on the one hand a negative, but on the other hand a positive and that some of who owns a home who is going to sell their first time home has a bigger downpayment for their move up home.  So there is this trickle up portion of this and then stimulus is adding to the availability of capital to support the home and mortgage business. You might find that interest rates knock some people out of the credit boxes that are out there. But there is so much demand, the backfill has been pretty readily supportive of maintaining sales pace. So at the end of the day, we really see very little trail off in demand.  In fact, it’s continued to be strong and be building what has been traditionally a spring selling season, it’s hard to detect where the spring selling season is because, we’ve been consistently strong all the way through what – at this time should be the beginning of this spring selling season. So, I think that what I say is that that we are still seeing a very strong demand pattern and even with interest rates picking up, there are offsets to that pick up that are keeping demand strong. 
Michael Rehaut: Great. I appreciate that, Stuart. Thank you for that. Secondly, and I know you guys are probably fairly reticent, but with the stock up on today’s news, obviously, both on the strong results, but also I think on the news of the spin, I don’t know if there is any other type of metrics that you could provide. I think one of the key numbers I guess was that this tax re-spin would be comprised of $3 billion to $5 billion in assets with no debt.  And you mentioned obviously the different businesses that would – from which the spin could be comprised of with LMC being the backbone. I was hoping is it possible, if you kind of take that $3 billion to $5 billion asset range, what would be the corresponding range for liabilities?  And also on the income statement side, any type of corresponding management fees or income that you are deriving from today that’s running through your income statement, as well as on the corporate G&A side? So, I don’t know if you could give, perhaps all those numbers, but even a few would be very helpful. 
Stuart Miller: So, as I said, we are giving you the skeleton right now. I think that, my starting point and just giving you some answer to that is, we start with a really strong balance sheet right now. You see debt-to-total cap at 24% and sizable profitability coming through the year. So, you can imagine our balance sheet continues to get stronger.  That really enables us to do a spin of a sizable amount of that that’s with no liabilities associated meaning no debt. And it leaves us with a balance sheet at Lennar that is just rock solid. So, very little impact to the balance sheet. Now from an operating and earnings standpoint, you can think similarly. Look, we’ve been building these businesses in the background and we’ve been reporting on them for years.  These businesses are up running and have been operating but because of the composition of some of them like LMC where you have depreciation and you have third-party management fees and a variety of things. They don’t show GAAP profitability. So – that’s all right.  You are going to see very little, if any impact to the earnings of the core company. But these operating businesses as they stand on their own with their own identified metrics, this enables those businesses to be able to run more effectively and efficiently as a standalone company. This is not about creating some notion of value earnings.  The standalone homebuilding financial services group and the standalone asset management business is the right configuration for these businesses on a go forward basis and you’ll see very little impact to Lennar’s the RemainCo bottom-line. And an exciting value proposition and standalone enterprise for Spinco as it stands on its own.  That’s the structure. That’s the skeleton. It’s as far as we can go right now. But all of this is driven by the fact that we have a balance sheet that supports we can give this kind of a strong spin or dividend as you might think about without impacting the underlying balance sheet and building two or furthering two very strong companies on a go forward basis.  And I would just say, Mike, as you think about this, remember, Lennar has done this before. In 1997, we’ve spun LNR and we did it in a very carefully constructive manner where it was two separate businesses that were longstanding and we identified and ran both companies to – in a very successful manner. And we expect to be doing some of that similarly all over again. 
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much. 
Stuart Miller: Okay. You bet. Listen, I know that this has been a lot to absorb and we’ve run over time. But I thought it was worth the time to do that. We look forward to continuing to update you on all elements of our business and look forward to a strong 2021. Thank you for joining. 
Operator: Thank you all for participating in today’s conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-12-17 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin. 
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for being here. This morning, I'm here in Miami, once again, scaled down and socially distanced crew that includes Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, our Controller; Bruce Gross, the Chief Executive Officer of Lennar Financial Services; and of course, Alex, who you just heard from; Rick Beckwitt, and Jon Jaffe, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Co-Presidents are joining us from Colorado and California, respectively. And they're on the line and will participate as well.  
 We're going to attempt to keep our remarks brief in order to have plenty of time for your questions. I'll give a brief macro overview and perspective. Rick will talk about land and community count. Jon will talk about sales, production and construction costs, and Diane will give a more detailed financial overview with highlights and with guidance. Then we'll attempt to answer as many questions. [Operator Instructions]
 So with that, today, I'd like to start by thanking the coast-to-coast associates of Lennar for extraordinary work in an extraordinarily challenging year. We started 2020 with great expectations in an expanding market, which came to an abrupt stop with the unexpected arrival of COVID and then left back into high gear to address the market with unusually strong demand that was desperate for a home, a refuge and a brand-new concept, the hub of everyone's life. The associates of Lennar adapted and adjusted, learned new ways to interact and to transact; work from home and put people first; cared for our communities across the country with acts of kindness and acts of charity; and on top of all of this, turned in pristine fourth quarter and full year 2020 results that are perfectly aligned with our company strategy and once again positioned Lennar as America's most profitable homebuilder.  
 Diane, Rick, Jon and myself have the privilege to prevent -- to present their results, and additionally, to guide with great confidence the expectations for another excellent year in 2021. As a macro overview, let me say that the housing market is simply very strong. And demand for homes, new and existing, is greater than the limited supply. It has simply never been this easy to sell as many homes as we would like in every market and every price range across the country. The American dream of homeownership is once again an essential aspiration of the American population and the resolution of the current pandemic will not slow the growing demand. Low mortgage rates and ample deposit money from savings, from vacations not taken, movies not seen, restaurants not visited and, of course, stimulus dollars from the government are driving customers to purchase a home, a larger home, a home with a yard, an office, a nicer kitchen and a place to call their own.  
 Apartment dwellers can afford a first-time home, and demand is strong and growing. The iBuyer participants led by Opendoor and early Lennar strategic investment are providing a liquid marketplace to sell and purchase entry-level homes with clean and safe digital engagement as they evolve and provide frictionless transactions. With constrained supply, entry level and workforce homes are trading faster and prices are moving higher. This enables yesterday's first-time buyers to sell for higher prices and more accumulated equity than expected, enabling them to seek and ultimately purchase larger, more spacious homes for their growing families and pushing demand and prices higher in those ranges as well, thus enabling second-time homebuyers to do the same. The positive demand Fed pricing cycle with far less friction has been activated throughout the housing market.  
 The underproduction of homes for the past 10 years has created a housing shortage. And with strong demand, the home prices are moving higher. Demand is growing as the millennial generation, which postponed family formation over the past 10 years, has pivoted quickly and is making up ground towards traditional family formation trends. Concurrently, the proposition of home as more than shelter is becoming a hardwired way of life rather than a COVID-driven reaction. 
 While these trends are exacerbating the well-documented affordability crisis across the country as workforce housing is limited and getting more expensive, the solution it seems will be in growing supply by building more housing. We are starting to see exactly that trend in this morning's ramp up -- in the ramp-up with today's starts and permits numbers, but we still have a lot to make up. These conditions have given rise to strong though controlled sales pace, pricing power, very strong gross margins, even stronger net margins, managed costs and the challenge of land scarcity. 
 As it relates to Lennar's strategy in the current environment, we have controlled sales pace and matched it with production and our valuable land position. Our 16% sales growth is matched with and reflects our production and delivery pace while we increased starts 28% over last year, accelerated land development and began purchasing additional land for the future as we look ahead for sustainable growth over the next years. Of course, along side our homebuilding team, our financial services group has contributed exceptional earnings while creating an ever-better customer experience. 
 While some had question our controlled and managed sales pace, the virtue of our strategy has been borne out by our 25% fourth quarter gross margin, our 17.4% fourth quarter net margin, our $2 billion fourth quarter homebuilding cash flow and our almost $2.5 billion bottom line for the full year. Additionally, our expected, sustained and orderly growth in 2021 continues the story for the future. As we noted last quarter, we are expecting historically strong margins for the foreseeable future and throughout 2021, and we expect our bottom line to grow faster than our top line.
 quarter, we are expecting historically strong margins for the foreseeable future and throughout 2021, and we expect our bottom line to grow faster than our top line. With confidence, we expect to deliver between 62,000 and 64,000 homes in 2021 with between a 23.75% and 24% gross margin as compared to the 22.8% full year gross margin in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to deliver between 12,200 and 12,500 homes with a 23.5% to 23.75% gross margin. Our program is rock solid, and you can expect the cash flow and returns on capital and equity will continue to improve as well. Diane, of course, will give more detail in her comments. 
 Let me briefly turn to our ancillary business divisions and our drive to focus on our core homebuilding and financial services business. While we continue to refine and grow our excellent ancillary business divisions, they are becoming a decidedly smaller part of the overall company picture. Retrospectively, we are very pleased that we sold our Rialto subsidiary some 2 years ago before we navigated the turbulence of this past year and enabling us to focus on our core business units. As noted in past conference calls, we've been working on strategies to better position our blue-chip multifamily platform called LMC, along with our emerging SFR, or single-family for rent platform, as well as our strategic investment in Fivepoint, our California land development company and our growing technology investments platform, which we call Lennox.  
 As a heads up, we are making progress on rationalization of these divisions. And we'll give greater clarity on our specific strategy as it is refined and become certain over the next 2 quarters. This resolution is no longer a long-term strategy but is more immediate as we focus on driving higher returns with less noise in our numbers from lumpy profits and losses. 
 In that regard, we expect Opendoor to begin trading as a public company in the near future, and we expect to record a cashless profit from appreciation in our investment in that platform, although we will not have an estimate of that gain until trading begins.  
 We will be required to record a profit on the day trading begins, but upward and downward movements in the stock will be recorded quarterly as quarterly marks and adjustments will flow through earnings. The company is not consolidated as we do not have a control position. 
 Opendoor pioneered the iBuyer space, and jointly, Opendoor and Lennar developed a seamless move-up program that today is becoming an industry standard. By coordinating and redefining the move-up buyer sale of their first home, while moving up to a larger home, the customer experience is becoming a frictionless, coordinated and joyful engagement. And of course, less friction means more transactions and more transactions at a lower cost to all parties involved. 
 Needless to say, our well-known technology initiatives have contributed meaningfully to our readiness for current economic and structural shifts while helping to improve our core business and drive our SG&A to a historic low of 8.1% for 2020.  
 Concurrently, our meaningful investments in technology companies have not only informed change within Lennar but are proving to be successful investments in their own right. Once again, we congratulate Opendoor on their successful migration from start-up to maturity to public company, and we welcome them in advance to the public market.  
 In conclusion, let me say that our results and our expectations for next year are solid in all respects, and they reflect our focused strategy to balance growth, margin, cash flow and returns.  
 Today and for the foreseeable future, the home is becoming more and more an essential way to live that we live and the quality of our lives. The home used to be just shelter. Now it's the hub of our entire life. It is our shelter and our multiple generation shelter. It is also our office, our gym, our recreation center and our school. It is WiFi connected, and it is automated. It is sustainable, and it is environmentally sensitive. It is both a healthy home and a health system. Home is where families thrive in the best of times and a refuge in the toughest of times.  
 At Lennar, we've never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to thrive and grow in this evolving and exciting housing market. 
 With that, let me turn over to Rick. 
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. As you can tell from Stuart's opening comments, the housing market is very strong. Our team is extremely well coordinated, and our financial results continue to benefit from a solid execution of our core operating strategies. Topping that list continues to be improving our returns on capital and generating increased cash flow. With that in mind, we have been laser-focused on increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing our years supply of owned homesites.  
 During fiscal 2019, we set a goal to have 40% of our homesites controlled via options and similar arrangements by the end of fiscal 2021. At that time, our controlled position was about 25%. We entered fiscal 2020 with 33% of our homesites controlled and ended this year at 39%, a 600 basis point improvement. 
 On a nominal basis, this reflected an increase of over 15,000 option homesites during the year. This increase reflects the strength of our relationships with local developers and other strategic partners and their desire to work with us to increase our option position given our size and scale in our markets.  
 In fiscal 2021, we expect to continue to expand on our existing relationships and enter into new regional and national land platforms to further enhance our land-light strategy. Based on this progress, we are in excellent position to achieve our revised goal of 50% controlled homesites by the end of fiscal 2021. During 2020, we also made significant progress on reducing our years owned supply of homesites by 4.1 years to 3.5 years. This represented a reduction of over 22,000 home sites.  
 Based on this progress, we are on target to achieve our previously announced goal of a 3-year supply by the end of fiscal 2021. As expected, the combined impact of increasing our controlled position, reducing our own position and our strong profitability drove significant homebuilding cash flow. During 2020, we generated $3.8 billion of homebuilding cash flow, which enabled us to pay off $2.1 billion in debt, including prepaying all of our senior debt due in fiscal 2021. This drove a meaningful improvement in our balance sheet as we ended the year with $2.7 billion in cash, no borrowings under our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility and a homebuilding debt-to-capital and net debt-to-capital of 24.9% and 15.3%, respectively, both all-time lows.  
 As we continue to execute on our land-light strategy and if we achieve our 2021 improved year-end goals, we are positioned to continue to generate significant cash flow.  
 Now I'd like to spend a few moments talking about growth and community count. In fiscal 2020, our community count declined by 8%. This was driven by an accelerated pace of sales and deliveries in our active communities. A decision to get out of the lower absorption, higher price point and lesser performing communities we acquired from CalAtlantic and a delay in opening new communities as we pause development activities during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notwithstanding the 8% decline in community count, we achieved a 16% increase in new orders in the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by a 27% increase in sales per community. While part of that increase in absorption pace was driven by improved market conditions, part of it was due to the fact that we targeted acquiring larger, higher volume entry-level communities that can deliver more homes per month than smaller communities. As we continue into fiscal 2021, our growth will continue to come from a higher overall absorption pace as well as an increase in community count. In 2021, our community count should increase by about 10%, most of which will happen in the middle part of the year, which should put us in great shape for the back half of 2021 and provide continued growth for fiscal 2022. While we continue to be focused on increasing our community count, we are intensely focused on replacing our existing communities with larger, higher volume communities as this allows us to better leverage our overhead, improve our bottom line and increase our returns and our cash flow. 
 Before I turn it over to Jon, I want to echo Stuart's comments and thank all of our associates and our trade partners for an excellent year. Through your hard work and collaboration, we accomplished many great things in 2020, and we are in excellent shape to execute on our core operating strategies in 2021. I'd like to turn it over to Jon now. 
Jonathan Jaffe: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Matching sales pace with our production pace has been a key strategic focus, has enabled us to drive excellent performance. By pairing production and sales, we have maximized margins and driven bottom line profitability. In the current environment, we've been able to maximize gross margin by systemically containing construction cost even while there's upward pressure. Additionally, we've been able to manage our SG&A lower, thereby increasing our net margin and overall profitability. I would like to briefly describe our strategy, performance and expectations for sales, production and construction costs in order to shed some light on how the strategy has been central to our accomplishments this quarter and in fiscal 2020. 
 It begins with our time-tested everything's included program. So our trades and construction associates know exactly what they will be building, and our customers know exactly what they are buying. We work with our strategic trade partners, the value engineer, our plans and rationalized plan count and SKUs to continuously simplify the supply chain and construction process. This proved to be extremely valuable in the current COVID-disrupted supply chain environment. Virtually every manufacturer in our industry has had some level of disruption at the manufacturing facilities due to COVID. 
 Next, we focus on being disciplined and consistent about executing the most efficient production-oriented machine in the homebuilding industry. The execution begins with setting even flow production rates at each community determined by a specific start pace and a product-based cycle time template, which we call level scheduling. This pace can be adjusted upward or downward as the market requires. 
 A start and production plan for forward planning is then communicated to every one of our trade partners so they can plan for labor and material needs and efficiently deploy people and provide materials and products as needed. This forward communication and coordination drives efficiencies that do not exist in a more erratic and less predictable sales-driven model. By leading with a production-first process, we were able to quickly increase our start pace after pausing production in March and April to understand the impact of the pandemic in Q2. We were able to evaluate the improving market conditions and quickly increase our even flow production to achieve an average start pace of 4.3 homes per month per community in Q4, which was up from 3.4 in Q4 of '19, a 41% increase in pace. We expect to increase that pace to 4.5 homes per month per community in the first quarter and to maintain that pace throughout the year. 
 We then match sales at the community level to the community's production pace by using pricing and incentives to determine the exact market pricing for that pace and efficiently match sales to the pace of production. In other words, our sales pace is defined by our desired maximum efficiency production pace, not by momentary changes and market conditions. 
 The sales process is also disciplined and simple and is best described as FIFO, or first in first out. The first home started in each community is the first home sold, and we move right down the line, plan type by plan type, avoiding selling too fast for our production pace by restricting what is available for sale through the management of our FIFO approach. 
 By selling homes in the same order of our starts, we manage the business to have our homes sold in time to -- for our customers to receive their mortgage approvals prior to the home being completed. Additionally, in today's robust selling environment, this disciplined approach allows us to maximize our pricing power to increase both margins and cash flow, and we end up carrying very few completed homes on our balance sheet. 
 In Q4, this approach drove our 25% gross margin, and we ended the quarter with 0.7 completed inventory homes per community or just 776 homes for the entire company as compared to 1.6 homes per community or 2,086 homes in the prior year. Balancing our sales pace with our production pace also helps reduce SG&A as fewer inventory homes helps lower our broker spend while creating greater efficiencies in our divisions through the even flow of sales, starts and deliveries. More importantly, this balanced and predictable program is key to being builder of choice for the trades and to very effectively managing costs in a market defined by labor shortages and cost pressures. 
 In conclusion, our strategy of a managed approach to production and sales pace certainly proved its value in the back half of 2020. As we look to next year, we are certain that we will continue to drive higher gross margins, lower SG&A, higher net margins and a stronger bottom line as a direct result of this carefully managed strategy. 
 I also want to add my thanks to all of our associates and trade partners for all of their great focus and hard work in the year like no other. 
 I'll now turn it over to Diane. 
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Although you've heard some of our financial results from Stuart, Rick and Jon, I'll begin by recapping certain of our Q4 2020 highlights and then provide guidance for 2021. 
 So let's start with the balance sheet. There are 3 areas that I want to touch on: inventory, cash flow and debt. 
 So starting with inventory. We executed on our strategy to become land lighter, improve returns and generate increased cash flow. At quarter end, we owned 187,000 homesites and controlled 119,000 homesites. This resulted in our year supply owned decreasing to 3.5 years from 4.1 in the prior year and our homesites controlled increasing to 39% from 33% in the prior year. We continue to make progress in reaching our goal of 3-year supply owned and 50% homesites controlled by the end of fiscal '21. 
 And then turning to cash flow. We generated $2 billion of homebuilding cash flows for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the year. Our confidence in our operating platform and ongoing cash flow generation enabled us to increase our annual dividend payment during the quarter to $1 per share from $0.50 per share. This increase is one component of our overall strategy of focusing on total shareholder returns. 
 And then looking at debt. We continue to make progress with our strategy of reducing our debt balances and leverage ratio. Our strong cash flow generation enabled us to pay off $1.2 billion of debt during the quarter and $2.1 billion during the year. The fourth quarter included the early redemption of all senior notes, which was approximately $900 million that were due in fiscal '21. 
 With that payoff, we now have no senior note maturities until fiscal 2022. These actions, combined with our increased equity base, resulted in a year-end debt to total capital ratio of 24.9%. This is the lowest debt to total capital ratio we have ever achieved. 
 And just a few final points on our balance sheet. Our stockholders' equity increased to $18 billion from $16 billion in the prior year, and our book value per share increased to $57.55 from $50.49 in the prior year. 
 And finally, during the quarter, we were pleased to be upgraded by Moody's to an investment-grade rating. This rating joins the investment-grade rating previously received by Fitch. 
 So in summary, our balance sheet is very strong, and we will continue to remain focused on generating long-term returns for our shareholders. 
 And so with those balance sheet highlights, let me now briefly review our operating performance, starting with homebuilding. 
 For new orders, we ended the quarter with new orders of 15,214, a 16% year-over-year increase. And as we focused on matching sales and production, our new order dollar volume was $6.3 billion, up 22% from the prior year. Our sales pace was 4.3 for the quarter compared to 3.4 in the prior year. We ended the quarter with 1,177 active communities, and our cancellation rate was 12%. 
 For the quarter, deliveries totaled 16,090, down 2% year-over-year. This was largely a result of the production loss to COVID-19 earlier in the year. Our gross margin was 25%, up 350 basis points from the prior year. This was a result of strong pricing power, which allowed us to increase sales prices and our continued intense focus in construction costs. Our SG&A was 7.5% as a result of creating an efficient operating platform and continuing benefits from technology. This is the lowest quarter SG&A percent we have ever reached. 
 This resulted in a net margin of 17.4% for the quarter, which is the highest quarter percentage ever achieved. And our financial services team also executed at high levels, reporting $151 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $125 million compared to $57 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited primarily from an increase in volume through a higher capture rate of increased deliveries, 81% versus 78% last year and a lower percentage of cash buyers combined with an increase in secondary margins. Title operating earnings were $28 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased primarily due to an increase in closed orders and a reduction in cost per transaction. LMF Commercial had operating earnings of $1 million compared to $3 million in the prior year due to lower securitization volume. 
 And with that brief overview, now let's turn to guidance. I'll provide -- I'll first provide detailed guidance for the first quarter and then some high-level guidance for the fiscal year, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 14,500 to 14,800 homes and our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 12,200 to 12,500 homes. Our Q1 average sales price should be around $390,000. We expect our Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 23.5% to 23.75%. Note this margin is lower than Q4 2020 due to the normal seasonal pattern. As a reminder, we expensed field costs in the current period, so there is typically a headwind to Q1 gross margin as compared to Q4 gross margin due to the lower homebuilding revenues in Q1. We expect our Q1 SG&A to be in the range of 8.9% to 9%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect Q1 earnings of approximately $5 million. We believe our financial services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $110 million to $115 million. And for multifamily operations, we expect a loss of approximately $2 million to $4 million. 
 For the other category related to the legacy Rialto assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q1 earnings of approximately $5 million. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2.1% to 2.2% of total revenue. The first quarter contains certain front-loaded expenses that will not occur in the remainder of the year. Our corp G&A expense for the year should be consistent with fiscal 2020. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.3%, and the weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 310 million shares. And so when you pull all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $1.64 to $1.74 per share for the quarter. 
 And now turning to the full year fiscal 2021, here are a few high-level guidance points. We expect to deliver between 62,000 and 64,000 homes with an average sales price for the year of approximately 386,000 to 388,000. Our fiscal '21 gross margin is expected to be in the range of 23.75% to 24%. We expect continued price appreciation and leverage from field expenses throughout the year, somewhat offset by higher lumber and other anticipated cost increases. Our fiscal '21 SG&A should be in the range of 7.8% to 8%, and we expect our community count to grow 10% by the end of the year. Financial services earnings should be in the range of $400 million to $425 million, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.3%. 
 And finally, before I turn it over to the operator, I'd like to say thank you to the accounting and planning teams whose hard work and focus enabled us to hold our year-end conference call today, December 17, 2.5 weeks after year-end. Thanks to all of you, it is very much appreciated. 
 And with that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. 
Stephen Kim: Congratulations to everyone for your strong performance. And your guidance was also extremely interesting for us. Many aspects of the guidance were very, very positive. And the one area that I was curious about, trying to gauge the level of conservatism that you've incorporated is in your ASP guide for closings. I observed that your order price, ASP rose almost 3% sequentially from the third quarter. That would seem to suggest that -- because I assume there was some mix shift in that, negative mix shift, I assume that, that means that like-for-like pricing is up about -- at least 1% per month in the quarter. And I was curious if this level of like-for-like pricing accelerated throughout the quarter or not. And if so, if you could provide a little bit of color on the closings ASP guidance, which I think is looking for a decline. I assume that's mixed, but I just wanted to ask the question. 
Diane Bessette: Yes. Steve, I'll answer that. So a couple of points. If you look at the ASP and new orders for the third quarter, remember, some of that did close in Q4. So that was part of the ASP in Q4. Additionally, if you look at the ASP in backlog, which is around that same range, note that the number of homes in backlog is about 30% of the midpoint of our guidance. So the point there is that while some of that will bleed through, there are other communities coming on and quite a few during the year or those that have not started producing new orders yet that are lower down the price point as we continue to really focus on affordability. And so while what you're seeing is a small snapshot of what you'll see in the quarter, there are other pieces -- I'm sorry, a small snapshot of the year, there are other pieces that will migrate that price down. 
Stephen Kim: Got it. Great. Could some comment on the like-for-like pricing that we saw in the quarter. I would assume that you probably saw at least 1% per month. Can you give us some color around that? 
Richard Beckwitt: Yes. I'm not sure we're going to give a percent, Steve, but we did see like-for-like pricing throughout the quarter. 
Stephen Kim: And did it accelerate at all, Rick? 
Richard Beckwitt: It was a gradual increase through the quarter, Steve. 
Stuart Miller: But let's just say, Steve, you're clearly seeing pricing power. So when you look at like-for-like, you're definitely seeing acceleration as we went through the quarter. Just remember that we are -- we have been focusing on entry level a little bit more, although that upwards spiral and demand entry level giving to move up and move up to second move-up is taking place at the same time. So we're balancing our product offering. So everything that you're seeing is part of averaging, including the like-for-like increases that were clearly seen through the quarters and as we go forward. 
Stephen Kim: Great. That's kind of what I was looking for. Second question relates to capital allocation. It seems clear from your opening remarks and just the results, the company is moving to a higher level of profitability here for the foreseeable future with controlled land spend and an already pretty under-leveraged balance sheet. Meanwhile, you got the multifamily and the other ancillary business platforms that seem to be, if anything, nearing a harvesting stage. 
 So bottom line, the question of what you're going to do with all this cash flow and the cash that you're going to be having is becoming very relevant. You already retired a lot of the debt that we had coming up. So how should we be thinking about your plans for capital allocation? And specifically, I'm curious as to how you think about the appropriateness of a stock buy back -- an increase or an acceleration in your stock buyback program? 
Stuart Miller: So let me start by saying thank you for pointing that out because that's exactly what we're focused on. I hope you're hearing a great deal of confidence in our operating platform and what we think is going to happen with our profitability and our cash flows and our migration and land position through 2021 because it does suggest and indicate that our cash position will continue to accelerate. 
 So the starting point in our office here is to focus on total shareholder return. And I think that we are laser focused on thinking about -- and you've seen the beginnings of that with the increase of our dividend. We weren't shy about that. We recognize the cash flow that we were seeing in its direction. And we made a migration in dividend last quarter. You've seen that we have accelerated some of our debt reduction, which only tends to delever the company. And some might say that we're under-levered. We're not apologetic about that. But at the same time, the cash flow that we are witnessing gives us a myriad of opportunities together with our ancillary businesses to think about how we generate higher returns. 
 As I said in my comments, you're going to hear more about this over the next couple of quarters. But a stock buyback is clearly not off the table, and it is something that we're looking at as we look at how we generate higher returns as we move forward. But I hope you're hearing that there's a great deal of confidence in our earnings and cash flow picture right now. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. 
Alan Ratner: Congrats on the really strong results, and glad to hear everyone's doing well on the line there. Stuart, I apologize, my audio cut out for a minute or 2 during your comments. So if you addressed this, I apologize. But a few years ago, you kind of threw out a longer-term growth target of, I think, it was about 5% to 7%. And part of that, I think, was where you maybe saw the market going. But I think more of that was just where you felt the business was most efficient in terms of growth over a longer time period. 
 And I'm curious based on kind of some of the guidance you've given for next year, it sounds like you're ramping your production to 4.5 starts per month, which would imply something well in excess of that type of growth level. And I'm just curious, based on what's transpired this year with COVID and some of the demographic tailwinds that you're seeing, whether that target range has shifted higher and you think that perhaps the business can grow efficiently at perhaps a little bit of a stronger growth rate than that? 
Stuart Miller: Good. Fair question, Alan. The reality is that in an orderly growth market, as we were witnessing going into 2020, we felt that the appropriate growth level, and given our cash flow and returns focus was in that -- it was actually 4% to 7% range. But as COVID came into the market, paused us and then accelerated the housing market, production levels and the needs of the homebuilding business, in general, have accelerated rather dramatically. And we have clearly adjusted our growth targets. 
 So what you're seeing for next year is between a 15% and 20% growth rate that we've embraced and we are focused on going forward. And we are continuing to use market-driven indicators to define our growth rate as we go and work towards 2022. If you look at the indicators right now, we're probably on target to be growing at a similar rate for 2022. So you'd have to put aside that 4% to 7% range because we're going to have to find a way and the industry is going to have to find a way to grow at an accelerated pace as we are supply constrained. And the market is just calling on the homebuilders to produce more and to produce more affordable housing. So we are part of that picture. You saw it in starts and permits this morning, a surprise to the upside. We're starting to get to that 1.5 million level production. It's probably weighted a little bit more towards multifamily right now, but single-family seems like it's going to follow suit. And we're just going to need more dwellings in the country. The appetite for housing is accelerating. 
Jonathan Jaffe: Alan, this is Jon. I'd also would add to Stuart's comments that as we focused on simplifying our product offering and our production machine, it's also enabled us to really keep what we view as a maximum efficiency level at a higher pace. We're doing this with smaller product, lower price point and just an overall more efficient production operation. 
Alan Ratner: I appreciate both of your comments there. And I think it dovetails a little bit into my follow-up, which is your strategy this year, I think, has certainly been extremely prudent, and you're seeing the benefits of that on your gross margin. And Jon, I appreciate all your comments about the -- kind of digging into the weeds a little bit on the moving pieces there on maintaining that consistent production level. 
 On the other side, some of your competitors have been much lumpier in terms of their growth rates. And I think as we look at the backlogs across the industry, for example, and what's poised to be a huge step-up in production in order to satisfy that demand, it kind of feels like there's going to be some stress on the supply chain as we roll into '21. And while you're managing your business effectively, do you anticipate any repercussions from that? What I'm really thinking about is labor inflation, potentially the dynamic we saw a few years ago where builders were kind of stealing trades off of each other's job sites to get homes built and delivered on time. Do you think there's any risk to your business as a result of what you're seeing from other builders right now? 
Jonathan Jaffe: Alan, I think there's no question, as I mentioned in my comments, that the environment we're in today is defined by labor shortage and pricing pressure. But you've heard consistently from us for many, many quarters now over the years about our focus on our builder of choice strategy. And that's holding us in really good stead and being able to coordinate forward plan with our strategic trade partners and to really manage and offset the cost increases that are out there in the environment. And more importantly, the predictability of our labor needs and be able to think way ahead with our trades as to those needs so they can properly plan and be ready for us. 
Stuart Miller: Let me add and say that what you've seen from us is a very steady hand, steady through the noise. Other builders have produced higher growth rates and sales paces. We've stayed focused on our business plan, our strategy. And I think it's a steady program that enables us to maximize the engagement with the supply chain and to remain consistent. And I think that Jon and Rick have been a steady rudder through those waters. And I think it's going to continue to reflect on strong bottom line, strong cash flow and a lot of predictability. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. 
Carl Reichardt: Stuart, I had a sort of bigger picture question for you is as the vaccine -- the COVID vaccine is distributed out and moves through the country, hopefully, quickly, I think we might anticipate some shift in consumer expenditures back to all the things so many consumers have not been able to buy and do for the last year or so. Are you anticipating if that happens for there to be a negative impact on expenditures on housing? And if so, how would you recognize and react to that? 
Stuart Miller: No. Well, first of all, I do hope that there is going to be a shift back to the restaurants and the movie theaters and the vacations. I think that a robust economic recovery requires some of that reversion to normal lifestyle. So I'm optimistic that there will be a kick back to normalcy. But I don't think that, that's going to have a negative impact. I think it's going to have more of a positive impact on the housing market. 
 I think that interest rates are low and they're going to remain low. Stimulus money will come through the government. I believe that it will, can't prove it but I think so. And I think that a stronger economy and a broader-based strong economy is going to be better for housing. I think that the current strength in the housing market derives from both the millennial generation really kicking into high gear and family formation. And frankly, in an awkward way, COVID has facilitated that accelerating. And then, of course, the COVID-driven recalibration for how people are using their homes, I think there will be some stickiness to some of the habits changed. 
 So I think, overall, we've all learned some new habits and some new customs and tricks, but I think a lot of it revolves around having the home of your choice and having your home be the hub of your life. And so I'm pretty optimistic about where the housing market is over the next years. 
 Remember, Carl, that over the past 10 years, we have been under-producing housing. And we're going to have to make up ground there. So for the foreseeable future, I think we're going to see strength in the housing market. 
Carl Reichardt: And then Jon or Rick, can you talk a little bit about the evolution of the FIFO inventory release matched to sales? And I'm kind of curious if that's becoming more of a help to governing your sales rate than just raising prices to try to slow sales down. It was an interesting walk through, Jon. I'm just kind of curious how it's evolved. And if it's company-wide and how it's working to maximize margin and pace at the same time. 
Jonathan Jaffe: Sure. I'd be happy to address that. So our FIFO pricing and sales strategy is not something new or COVID-related. We established this process in one of our divisions out West, in Reno, and really fine-tuned it and saw its effectiveness in not just maximizing pricing power, but really creating efficiencies throughout the process that affects every part of what we do. We actually rolled it out at a division presidents' meeting about 2 years ago and started with some pilot divisions, saw its effectiveness in all different types of markets and have rolled it out throughout the entire company. So this exists in every one of our divisions. And to your point, is it just about maximizing pricing power by having a limited number of homes available, it really allows us to very carefully manage and match that sales pace to production pace and to be very forward-looking about any adjustments that we need to make in pricing and incentives up or down as the case might be to very meticulously manage that pace. And it just creates consistency and even flow that affects earlier G&A levels to be leveled instead of having to be positioned for peaks and valleys. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. 
Truman Patterson: Let me add a nice results as well. So question on cash flow. You all generated $3.8 billion in builder cash flow on net income of only, I think, $2.4 billion this year. When we're looking out to 2021, how should we think about the free cash flow conversion of net income? And clearly, there are likely a handful of moving parts between continuing to bring down your own lot supply, reinvesting in option land, et cetera, and possibly rebuilding some of that spec pipeline. Hoping you can walk us through some of the moving parts there. 
Stuart Miller: Yes. So I'm going to ask Rick to weigh in on this. But before he does, let me just say that we've learned that there are some tricky parts of the calculation and the guidance that we can give, and we recognize that cash flow is one of those. Growth at a higher level is a headwind to cash flow. The migration of land from owned to controlled, a greater percentage and a lower year count is a tailwind to cash flow. So we've been careful not to lay out -- because the parts will move around to lay out specificity. But go ahead, Rick. 
Richard Beckwitt: So I'm not going to answer that, Stuart. That's a mouse trap. I guess, all I would say is as we continue to morph and execute on reducing the years owned and that gets into option, there's no doubt that, that is a significant generator of cash. And the unknowns, as Stuart has identified and as you have appropriately pointed out is as we build the level of inventory to ramp up to that 62,000 to 64,000 home delivery pace, that's a reinvestment of cash. And so there's a lot of moving pieces in here. And I'm sure Diane will give you more color on this in the follow-up call. 
Stuart Miller: But look, let me say this, as we look ahead to 2021, we have a great deal of confidence that our cash flow is going to be very strong. You're absolutely right. This past year, we earned just under $2.5 billion net income and drove $3.8 billion in cash flow. Some of that is migration of our land strategy. That land strategy is going to continue through 2021. So we're fully expecting that we're going to have very strong cash flow through the year, but we're not guiding in specificity. 
Truman Patterson: Okay. Okay. And just real quickly on that owned land supply, do you think you can bring it down below 3 years eventually? 
Richard Beckwitt: I think that if you look at where we started at over 4 and the transformation that we've had in a very short period of time, we're really enthusiastic about getting to 3. And we're just going to have to see how low we can get it. There's definitely a possibility to get it below 3. Definitely a possibility. But there's a balance because we have some markets, particularly the Western markets that in order to be a big, large player in those markets, you have to self-develop. So Jon has done a great job -- Jon and the team have done a great job in working through and creating some very unique structures to help us get there. And so I would just say stay tuned. 
Stuart Miller: And I think the laser focus of the management team is to think about land and the system around land as a just-in-time delivery system, and we are going to get closer and closer to that aspiration. 
Truman Patterson: Okay. That's very helpful. Second question on gross margins. You all focused on driving pricing to kind of cap absorptions and cover the FIFO costs, if you will, more than the other builders. And clearly, based on your gross margin guidance, it appears your homes are selling at a premium in the market. This might be hard to quantify or a bit of an unfair question, but is there any way you could possibly quantify what magnitude your homes might be selling at a premium? And as we move forward, as kind of market conditions potentially normalize, where there's a bit more balance between supply and demand, do you think that premium potentially shrinks over time? 
Stuart Miller: I don't think it's so much a premium as I think it's an orderly process that is driving the average higher. And so I think we're competing in a market where customers understand what the value proposition is. I think it's just process-driven that we are just driving a higher sales price by an orderly process of production and sales. 
 And so I wouldn't think of it as a like kind premium. If you go out to the market and look at our 1,500 or our 2,000 square foot home next door to someone else's, I think it's just a matter of process. 
Richard Beckwitt: And I think our product strategy, our everything's included program makes it much easier for our customers to make a buy decision because they don't have to make any choices. And that's a big differentiator. 
Jonathan Jaffe: And I would just briefly add that if you think about our FIFO strategy, we price to market what the market will bear, not to what our competitors are pricing. 
Operator: Our question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. 
Michael Rehaut: Congrats, everyone, and glad to hear everyone's doing well. And congrats to Allison as well, Allison Bober. Great to hear the news there. First question, just around gross margins. Great success there and a real realization of the price-over-pace strategy or steady pace and driving price. Wanted to delve in a little bit to, if you can kind of break down the upside in the 4Q results, where that came from, if it was more just better-than-expected pricing power during the quarter or mix. 
 And then as you look into '21, it seems like your -- the guidance would imply 4Q margins down year-over-year as we get towards the end of the year. And I just didn't know if there was any conservatism there, and you had mentioned lumber and maybe labor inflation. But historically, when you're in an inflationary cost inflation environment, you're able to at least offset that with future pricing power oftentimes, as we've seen in the past. So kind of a 2-parter there. Again, first, drivers of the 4Q upside; and then how to think about margins in particularly the back half of '21. 
Stuart Miller: Rick? 
Richard Beckwitt: So I guess I'd say with regard to the overall gross margin guidance for the year and the trajectory through the year, I'd really like to start off by pointing out that there's a huge -- over 100 basis point year-over-year increase in the gross margin guidance. And there certainly are some  things that are impacting the margin as we work through it. One is lumber did increase pretty dramatically, and we're now in the throes of dealing with that, although we've done a great job in offsetting -- raising prices. 
 The other driver is the overall increase in our option deliveries. By increasing the share of option versus controlled, we have the tendency to have a little bit lower margin -- gross margin on that because someone else is taking the risk of owning that land. And so I don't think you'll see quite as much drive throughout the year as we've seen in the past because of those 2 things. 
Michael Rehaut: And then on the 4Q upside? 
Stuart Miller: Yes. I think there's an adequate amount of conservatism as we look out 4 quarters. We're going to have to wait and see how the pricing power plays through. And so I think we tried to give a lot of detailed guidance and some directional guidance for the -- detailed guidance for the first quarter and directional guidance for the year. And as Rick notes, our averages for the -- our average for the year is 100 basis point improvement, which is sizable. We'll have to see how pricing power meshes with production costs. 
Diane Bessette: Mike, and I probably would just add on Q4 2020. It was -- if you look on a per square foot basis, it was equally split with increase in the ASP per square foot with -- combined with equal decrease in construction cost per square foot. So pretty balanced between the both of them. 
Michael Rehaut: Okay. Appreciate it. And secondly, Stuart, I heard in, I was paying attention here, in one of your answers, addressing closings growth for '21, and I believe it was talking around prior kind of growth outlooks in maybe mid-single-digit area. Now we're looking at 21% and 15% to 20%. I believe you had said that you could do a similar growth rate in 2022, which is, at this point, also solidly above consensus estimates and where the Street is and probably most investors. I just wanted to revisit that comment. 
 And if that was talking more just to your production potential and what you think you can kind of further drive through your infrastructure or based on community count growth and your shift to higher turning -- or I'm sorry, higher volume communities that this is more of a 15%, 20% growth rate based on, again, your community count pipeline. And obviously assuming a continued, steady or improving market, you indeed are looking at something of a higher -- just higher growth rate continuing into '22. Just wanted to get a little more definition on that comment. 
Stuart Miller: Well, listen, Mike, let me start by saying thank you for listening carefully to the things that I say, not everybody does that. And I just want to appreciate the fact that you were listening carefully. 
 So you're exactly right. I said what I said and I said what I meant. If you think about what we have daylighted in the entirety of the call today, we have daylighted an expectation that our community count will be growing through 2021.  We have daylighted that we are focused on more productive, larger communities producing higher volume rather than smaller incremental communities. We have daylighted that some of our community count has dissipated as we have worked through some of the smaller, less productive CalAtlantic communities and close them out. 
 We have daylighted our matching of production together with our sales pace and migrating our production pace upward over the course of this year, over the next quarter even. We are ramping up not just our productivity per community, but the style of community that we're intending to purchase.
 And if you kind of bring that forward through 2021 and into 2022, you can't help but -- unless the market tells us and data tells us to hone down or turn down the spigot, you can't help but start to think and project forward that '22 will continue a growth trajectory that is somewhat similar. And we're building a greater confidence in our ability to look ahead and to do that, assuming market conditions remain strong. 
 Then going back to my comments in the opening, I think that if you think about the confidence that we're projecting about market conditions, thinking about a 10-year hiatus or production deficit that underlies the current market conditions and the general growing demand with limited supply for the foreseeable future, the market is asking us to grow at a greater growth rate, and we're building confidence that we're going to be able to meet that challenge. So you heard me right. Thank you for listening, and that's exactly what we intended to say. 
 Great. And I guess in closing, we'll say happy holidays to everybody. Thanks for joining our year-end call, and we look forward to updating in the future. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-09-15 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar’s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statement.
Alexandra Lumpkin: Thank you and good morning. Today’s conference call may include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding Lennar’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar’s estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar’s actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in yesterday's press release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption, Risk Factors, contained in Lennar’s Annual Report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chair. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, and thank you, everyone. This morning, I'm here in Miami, once again, scaled-down crew that includes Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller; Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services. And of course, Alex, who you just heard from; Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer is in Colorado; and Jon Jaffe is in California. Jon Jaffe, our President in California, and they're on the line with us this morning and will participate in our question-and-answer period. Today, we're going to keep our remarks brief. We have historically given a broad overview when market conditions have been uncertain. Today, however, with a clearly defined strong and improving market will leave more time for your questions. Therefore, I'll give a brief overview, and Diane will give financial information highlights and guidance, and then we will attempt to answer as many of your questions as possible. As usual, please limit questions to one question per customer and one follow-up. So, as you can see from our press release, our third quarter was an excellent quarter for Lennar, and it reflects the robust state of the housing market across the country. Inventories are limited and demand remains strong, driven by low interest rates and customer focus on owning and controlling their lifestyle. Our solid sales growth rate of 16% year-over-year, which is well in excess of our targeted growth rate of 4% to 7%, reflects excellent execution of a very disciplined approach to sales pace. As we witnessed lumber prices accelerate throughout the quarter, we deliberately sold today's current inventory and limited sales on tomorrow's yet-to-be started homes. Our strategy in the current market condition is to be patient with longer term sales and enable price appreciation to offset future cost escalations and maximize margin, while selling only more current inventory improves our inventory turn. Simply put, sales could have been stronger with a singular focus on volume, but instead, we drove margin growth and cash flow, while allowing price appreciation to cover cost escalation in the future. As I've noted in prior calls, it is challenging at best to materially ramp production in this labor-constrained market, and it's even more challenging to replace entitled land in this land-constrained market. Therefore, our measured growth strategy produces sustainably high margins, higher inventory turns and the best return on our assets. Accordingly, while managing sales pace, our margins have grown as demand has grown, and supply has remained limited. Our 23.1% gross margin and 15.1% net margin represents strong pricing power in the market and careful day-to-day oversight by our management team. We're expecting historically strong margins for the foreseeable future and throughout 2021, and we expect our bottom line to grow faster than our top line. As expected, our closings in the third quarter were limited by the production pause we took in March, April and May, as we assess the impact of COVID on the housing market. We increased starts and production as the market recovered, so production and deliveries will normalize as we move into 2021. Alongside the homebuilder, Lennar Financial Services continued its focused attention to technology-enabled efficiencies. LFS's pre-tax contribution this quarter was $135 million as compared to $95 million last quarter, excluding a one-time profit realized from States Title, which represents a 50% sequential increase. With the market this robust, the dominant questions for both Lennar and the industry are how will we continue to meet demand, to grow land positions and manage labor, materials and particularly lumber costs. These are the questions that have the undivided attention of our management team right now. And we're very confident that we'll be able to meet demand, drive high margins and cash flow, while we continue to grow with the market. For the short term, we are already extremely well positioned to manage costs and meet demand. While we're selling through communities somewhat faster than expected, we are well fortified with strong land positions that will be brought online. And while lumber, in particular, and other costs are rising, we are actively managing sales pace, primarily to started homes in order to manage that cost risk. For the intermediate term, we are and have been accelerating starts and production of homes under construction, while also accelerating the readiness of new communities that we control wherever possible. And for the longer term, we are focused on ramping up our land purchases for new communities, as we believe the industry will have a sustained expansion for the foreseeable future. With historically low interest rates, and the production deficit that has defined homebuilding for the past decade, together with the limited inventory and short supply in the market, housing and especially affordable housing is and will continue to be an essential driver of the economy. As we grow offerings for the future, we've remained focused on our option versus owned land strategy and we will continue to manage towards a 50-50 target. At the end of the third quarter, we had expanded our options percentage to 35% from 30% earlier in the year. We also continue to focus on cash flow and returns on equity and capital as we ended the quarter with almost $2 billion of cash on hand, 0 drawn on our revolver and a healthy debt-to-total cap of 29.5%. Needless to say, our well-known technology initiatives have contributed meaningfully to our readiness for current economic and structural shifts, while helping to improve our core business and drive SG&A to a historical low of 8%. Concurrently, our meaningful investments in technology disruptor companies have not only informed change within Lennar, but are proving to be successful investments in their own right. Today's announcement by Opendoor and early Lennar Investment is a case in point. Opendoor pioneered the iBuyer Space and Opendoor and Lennar jointly developed a seamless move-up program that today is becoming an industry standard. By coordinating and redefining the move-up buyer sale of their first home, while moving up to a larger home, the customer experience is becoming a frictionless, coordinated and joyful engagement. Less friction means more transactions and more transactions at a lower cost to all parties engaged. I'd like to take a quick moment to congratulate our friends at Opendoor and their leader, Eric Wu, as they take their vision and their dream to the next level. For us at Lennar, it has been an honor to be a part of their journey thus far as we have learned and adjusted together to build a leader and innovator in the iBuyer space. In advance of the completion of Opendoor's transaction with Social Capital, we would like to welcome you Opendoor to the public markets, as you continue to define the path forward in this industry transforming space. In conclusion, let me say that our third quarter results were solid in all respects and they reflect our focused execution on our strategy to balance between growth, margin, cash flow and returns. In just a minute, Diane will give some additional color on our third quarter numbers and our expectations for the fourth quarter. But before turning over to Diane, let me say, the third quarter has been a clear point of pivot for the housing market in general, from the slowdown created by COVID to the expansion ignited by COVID. Today, the home is becoming more and more essential to the way we live and the quality of our lives. The home, which used to be just shelter is now becoming the hub of your life. It is our shelter and our multiple generations shelter. It is our office, our gym, our recreation center and our school. It is WiFi connected and it is automated. It is sustainable and environmentally sensitive. It is both a healthy home and a health system. While some of these elements will change over time, some of them will become our new way of life. Regardless, home is a refuge where families thrive through the best of times and sometimes as well through the toughest of times. At Lennar, we are focused on meeting the needs and the changing appetites and aspirations of this changing world, and we have never been better positioned financially, organizationally and technologically to meet the challenge as well as the demand. With that, let me turn over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: So thank you, Stuart, and good morning to everyone. So I'd like to begin with a few Q3 highlights and then provide detailed guidance for Q4. And so let's start with our balance sheet. As Stuart mentioned, as a result of our continued focus on cash flow generation, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.4 billion revolving credit facility. On a year-to-date basis, through the end of Q3, we have generated $1.8 billion of homebuilding cash flow. We also continue to make progress to become land lighter. As stated, our years supply owned decreased to 3.8 years, and our homesites controlled increased to 35% of total homesites. For the quarter, our land acquisition spend was $607 million, and our land development spend was $571 million. Additionally, we also made progress with our goal of reducing debt. During the quarter, we paid off approximately $400 million of debt. And as a result, our quarter-end homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio was 29.5%. This is the lowest debt-to-total capital ratio we have ever achieved. Our focus on debt reduction will continue as we pay off $300 million of senior notes due in November. Since the acquisition of CalAtlantic and including the notes we intend to pay off in the fourth quarter, we will have repaid $2.8 billion of senior notes, which results in an annual interest savings of approximately $156 million. Our stockholders' equity increased to $17.2 billion and our book value per share was $59.41 -- sorry, $54.91. And so with those balance sheet highlights, let me now briefly review our operating performance. As we said, we ended the quarter with new orders of 15,564, up 16%, and our new order dollar value was $6.3 billion, up 2%. Sales were matched with starts and our starts were up 17% year-over-year. Our sales pace was 4.2% for the quarter, compared to 3.4% in the prior year. And we ended the communities with 1,198. We ended the quarter with 1,198 communities. Our cancellation rate was 15% compared to 19% sequentially in Q2 and 16% in Q3 of the prior year. For the quarter, deliveries totaled 13,842, up 2%, and both deliveries and new orders were the highest for a third quarter in the company's history. Our gross margin was 23.1%, as a result of strong pricing power and our focus on construction costs. And our SG&A was 8% as a result of creating an efficient platform and continuing benefits from technology. The 8% -- in the third quarter SG&A we have ever achieved. Turning to Financial Services. They also executed at high levels, as Stuart mentioned, reporting $135 million of operating earnings. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $113 million, compared to $57 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings benefited primarily from an increase in volume through a higher capture rate of increased delivery, 82% versus 77% last year, and a lower percentage of cash buyers, combined with an increase in secondary margins. Title operating earnings were $21 million compared with $18 million in the prior year, and title earnings increased primarily due to an increase in closed orders. And LMF commercial had operating earnings of $1 million compared to $4 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower securitization volume. And so with that quick summary, let me provide you with a little more detailed guidance for Q4 that what we included in our earnings release. Starting with homebuilding. We expect new orders between 13,800 and 14,300, and should end the year with approximately 1,165 active communities. We expect to deliver between 15,500 and 16,000 homes. Our average sales price should be around $390,000. We expect our gross margins to be in the range of 23.25 to 23.5, and our SG&A should be in the range of 7.7% to 7.8 %. And for the combined category of homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and others, we expect a loss of between $15 million and $20 million. We believe our financial services earnings will be between $100 million and $105 million. And for both our multifamily and Lennar Other segments, we expect a slight loss. Corporate G&A, we expect that to be around $95 million for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. The weighted average share count should be approximately $309 million. And when you combine all of this, the guidance should produce an EPS range of $2.22 to $2.38. We hope that you find this guidance helpful. And with that let’s turn it to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today’s conference. [Operator Instructions] And our first question in queue is from Ivy Zelman at Zelman Associates. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you and congratulations, guys, on a great quarter. Stuart, although you mentioned and sort of highlighted the fact that you could have grown at a stronger rate while we see other builders posting numbers like MDC today over 70% growth. I think the market is looking and founding on your results from an order perspective because you're losing market share which, of course, we don't see that over a longer-term basis. You'll continue to gain share. But maybe talk about the benefit of measured growth, you mentioned cash flow, returns, costs and really the – and the risk maybe of not trying to grow faster and walk us through in more detail, maybe providing some metrics on the risk and befits and more specifics?
Stuart Miller: You know, we highlighted some of this in our comments. There are a number of benefits as we see it. We noted that as we watch real time, lumber prices spiral upward, and this is across the country, across the industry. We recognize the risk associated with getting way out ahead in cost as production ramps up. We all know that the labor market has been constrained. It's possible that with unemployment levels, we'll find new entrants to our market over time. We'll have to wait and see. We know that there's exposure on the cost side of the equation. We have chosen not to get into the race to see how many sales we can have, but instead, to carefully focus on the homes that we have an inventory, that we have under production and really limit sales going forward, so that price appreciation can cover cost increases as we go forward. And of course, the focus on current inventory just helps ramp up inventory turn, which helps focus on returns on capital, return on equity. Jon, Rick, do you want to weigh in on that?
Jon Jaffe: Sure, it's Jon. As Stuart mentioned, on lumber, it increased almost 100% from the beginning of our quarter to the end of our quarter. And so it's very measured with taking advantage of an increasing sales price environment to match that, meaning as we patiently pace our sales, we will benefit from that price appreciation really helps offset that increase. And as you look at the supply chain, it is not just labor, but from the manufacturers, it's probably why leverage run out there, there's constraints. And so again, to be very measured in terms of being able to communicate to our trade vendors exactly what our production capacity is instead of quickly trying to ramp it up, which is not really feasible to do. We think it's a much more measured and appropriate approach.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. Ivy, the only thing I'd add to that is, as Stuart, Jon, and I have really looked at the limited inventory that's available on the market, there's really premium pricing available for things that are close to completion or completed. And it doesn't make sense for us to sell so early or do a dirt sale when we can command a higher price because people want something they can move into.
Ivy Zelman: That's really helpful.
Stuart Miller: At the end of the day -- let me just say that at the end of the day, for us, it comes down to margin and margin growth and margin focus. We're going to be able to increased returns on the assets that we have and have a measured approach going forward. I think it's very difficult in this market to ramp up production at an accelerated rate when we see sales rates coming in at a very high rate production just has to lag, there's only so much that can be brought to the market at any one time.
Ivy Zelman: And I would just add just to maybe have you frame the market share question because we had a bunch of questions this morning. If we think about market share over a two-year period and thinking about being the leading builder in the U.S., there's no question that next year, these builders are going to have a very challenging time growing off of that. So, maybe just comment around -- and recognizing you guys aren't about market share, it's about returns. But just to comment on market share, if you would, please. Thank you and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you. Rick, Jon, go ahead.
Jon Jaffe: I think we've talked for a long time, Ivy, about our size and scale position. And we're number one or two in virtually all the markets that we're in. And that size and scale really gives us an advantage relative to land positions as a go-to builder for the land sellers and as do the go-to builder for the trades. And in this constrained environment, that strategic position is very important to us and it's one that we're not going to give up. But instead, it's a very -- as we said, very steady and measured pace, creating predictability for both land and for the trades.
Rick Beckwitt: And I guess the other thing I'd add, Ivy, which is just math. If you just take a 16% growth in sales for the quarter on a $50,000 plus type of run rate and compare that to a much higher growth rate on a smaller builder, we're still gaining share.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Next question.
Ivy Zelman: Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is open.
Carl Reichardt: Hi. Thanks everybody. I had a couple of questions on my end pretty well. We know about constraints from a product perspective, from a labor perspective. Can you talk about if there's been some normalization in terms of permitting processes, entitlements and approvals, since we've seen COVID sort of come back a little bit here? Are we seeing some normalization in the time it takes to get land to market?
Jon Jaffe: Hi, Carl, it’s John. I think, certainly, cities have opened up compared to when COVID was first hitting us in cities closed down. But they clearly are under stress. They’re all under budgetary constraints, many of them operating virtually. So it's not back to normal pre-COVID, but it's better than it was at the worst part of the COVID experience. It's somewhere in between and so it is definitely not an easy process, given those constraints that exist.
Carl Reichardt: Okay. Thanks Jon. And then, as a follow-up, can you talk about markets where land has gotten appreciably tighter, say, over the last year or two? Are there a couple out there that -- where we've seen a big change in the availability of lots, pricing of lots, as builders have expanded? Thanks a lot.
Rick Beckwitt: I don't think we've seen any specific markets that are out of whack. We continue to benefit from the solid relationships we have with the land community. We've been doing transactions and strategizing for years with the land community. And those deep relationships are continuing to provide us opportunities, as Stuart mentioned.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks, Rick.
Stuart Miller: I think as we look ahead and as we have looked ahead, we think that our position, our strong market share position across the board, enables us to access land and grow community count as we look towards 2021. Rick, maybe you'd like to comment on some of that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. So for 2021, we're anticipating a 10% community count increase year-over-year. We have all those communities in hand today. And are very comfortable with the rollout of those throughout the balance of 2021.
Carl Reichardt: Great. Thanks, guys.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Next Question.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Yes, good morning. Yes, I think that comment about the communities was something that we were kind of waiting for. So that really helps frame all of your commentary about your longer-term plan for growth and so forth. So I want to ask you a question about mix. The data we've been seeing nationally seems to be pointing to positive mix occurring in the resale market, at least, from what we can see. It's a pretty dramatic reversal from the past several years. And at the same time, though, for builders like yourself, moving away from the resale market. You have so little inventory at the lower price points in the resell market that you're getting a lot of spillover demand into the new market. So I'm trying to figure out you got, on the one hand buyers kind of wanting to trade up to maybe a little larger footprint and larger homes. And at the same time, you got the spillover demand out of the resale market flowing into the new home market, bringing lower mix. So as you look out over the next year, which is going to be a bigger factor, the trading up, positive mix effect or the first-time buyer negative mix effect coming from the resale market?
Rick Beckwitt: Go ahead Jon.
Jon Jaffe: I think we're benefiting from both. And it's really a great time for the housing market. And that fluctuation mix may vary within specific submarkets. But we're seeing a tremendous amount of conversion of renters into home buyers in that first-time segment, and we're seeing good strength in a lot of our move-up markets from that spillover, as you noted. And with people looking for new, looking for moving away from density, we expect we'll continue to see the demand from both of those mix segments.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. And just following up on the new home automation is just incredible demand, WiFi connectivity, no dead spots in the home. The home automation package that we're offering is a real driver of growth, whether it's on the entry-level or the move-up side.
Jon Jaffe: And along those very same lines, home innovation, the way that people are using their home today is completely facilitated by new technologies or better technologies that are driving the home forward, whether it's automation, whether it's connectivity, whether it's healthy home or access to health services. The home, as I said in my remarks, it's not just shelter anymore. It's multigenerational. It's an office. It's a gym. It's recreation. It's all of the attributes and so newer homes with newer designs and newer technologies are definitely benefiting in today's market. Temporarily, at least for the time being, friendliness and access to a clean environment to look at a new home is an added advantage. And just going back to an earlier part of your question, Steve, remember that the first-time buyer home market in many ways, ignites the move-up market. So whether first-time buyers are looking at resale homes, that enables the first-time buyer of yesterday to move up. And first-time buyers are also looking at first time brand-new homes in large part because of technologies and different designs. So it's all mashing together. The primary driver is the production deficit that we've been talking about for the past years. It's been a decade-long that you've seen production deficit which means that we are in short supply across the board given the population, so all segments of the market are moving at the same time.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Thank you for that. It's kind of been a thesis of ours that when you see home buying preferences changed quickly that you would see the new home price premium increase because builders such as yourselves can change what you sell and what you build to adjust to those new preferences. And so in that regard, you talked about a 10% increase in community count next year, obviously, with strong sales, that's a – you're bringing a lot of new communities online to sort of offset the ones that you're burning out of or selling out of. So if we were to look at the communities that you are bringing online, over the course of the next year. And we were to compare that with the communities that we brought online over the last year or so. Would we see a discernible mix difference in those communities? Whether it be the kinds of options and upgrade or the amount of options and upgrades that you would have included in your -- everything is included packages or some other things maybe more next-gen? Or if there's some way you could talk about how your future communities are reflecting the opportunity for some of these new features and maybe directly enhancing your mix?
Stuart Miller: At the community level, you're not going to see much of a change. It's at the product level that you will see discernible change. You've seen us emphasize more and more our next-gen product, which is the home within a home or an office within a home or gym within a home, that product mix has been moving. But additionally, you're seeing additional product offerings embedded in the homes that we deliver. We are rolling out as we speak, a new home automation package that is designed for the family lifestyles of tomorrow. And you're seeing more emphasis on elements like healthy homes and other attributes that people are looking for in today's market. These are action items that are defining the appetites of customers, and you're seeing it at the product level, not so much at the community level, and this is across our product offering. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. So the only thing I'd add to that is that you'd see us utilizing extremely efficient, highly productive product that's going to continue to drive those margin increases. Jon and the team have done a phenomenal job at value engineering, what we built and just continuing to drive cost out. That combined, you'll see a continuation of our focus on the entry-level and that first time move-up, to really capture the flag that you were talking about with regard to where the market growth is.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. First, I just wanted to hit on pricing. Obviously, a lot of talk about managing pace versus price and the gross margin results are certainly impressive. Just trying to get a sense for -- if you could give us any type of range perhaps of the magnitude of price increases on average that you were able to implement this quarter across our community base. And as part of that, you mentioned premium pricing for your inventory, which you had moved. I -- if there's any ability to also give some color on if you were able to move price more on the spec or as well as what price you were able to achieve, price increases on your overall build-to-order product or more, more typical mix?
Jon Jaffe: So -- okay. We've seen pricing power really across almost all of our markets. It's anywhere from good to very strong. And it'd be hard to really single out one product type or price point or market that really outshines another. We've seen strong sales pace and strong pricing power across the board. And that's reflected in that margin improvement that we had over our guidance. As Rick said, we really applied that to our inventory. So that turned very quickly into our deliveries and reflected very well in our margins in our third quarter deliveries and our margin in our backlog as we look forward. So it is unusual to think about inventory as a premium. Usually inventory are the homes that you have trouble moving. But in this environment really is what is desired by the consumer to want to move now, move into a new situation move out their old housing.
Michael Rehaut: Great. No, that's helpful. I appreciate that, Jon. I guess, secondly, maybe shifting to returns and obviously, turning your inventory fast over is certainly a great way to achieve better returns. There are several levers, however, that you guys continue to look at and try and pull, I think, as part of your strategy over the next couple of years to drive higher turns. You talked about the increase in option lots. I was hoping to maybe shift the focus and ask about two other areas: One, your balance sheet itself has various investments that are, as you've kind of highlighted with Opendoor, important and strategic, you obviously have $1.2 billion in Lennar Multifamily. You have other investments in unconsolidated of around $1 billion. How do you think about those assets going forward? And also, if I can squeeze in on the share repurchase, how should we start thinking about that over the next year or two?
Stuart Miller: Rick, you want to take that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I think we're constantly evaluating ways to maximize the underlying value of those investments. As Stuart said, over and over that we're very focused on reverting to core. We're very focused on enhancing the returns and maximizing the value of the assets. If you look at the various components, whether it's LMC, which is a blue chip, Class A Multifamily production machine, they have created a great franchise. Moving to the technology, I'll really let Jon and Stuart talk about that. But the investments that have been made there as Stuart has said, benefit the core with regard to increasing the efficiencies of our operations, but also we really lay the groundwork for, hopefully, some great returns on those investments in and of themselves.
Jon Jaffe: So let me just add to that and take two pieces of it. It does not escape our attention that our Multifamily reported earnings as opposed to the accumulated value that we've created. The reported earnings are virtually nothing relative to a very sizable investment, and that does not enhance our returns. Accordingly, we have focused on the fact that it no longer is a strategic benefit for us to have that on book because it is dilutive to the returns that we're striving to achieve. And so we are very focused on looking for our next program relative to LMC, our Multifamily program, as Rick properly notes, it is a blue-chip asset, a blue-chip operating platform, and we're focused on where it will land in its next iteration. So, this has been a day-to-day focus for both myself and for Rick. We're working on that regularly. You asked the question also about stock buyback. You'll remember that prior to the COVID-19 moment; we were buying back stock on a regular basis. We have -- we postponed that as we saw COVID drive the market lower. We took a wait and see attitude. We've continued that latency attitude and have not bought back stock during the past quarter as well. But as we look ahead, we are clearly looking at our extraordinarily strong cash and liquidity position, and looking how we deploy capital in an even way. We're clearly going to pay down debt which we've already day-lighted. We will, in some form, resume a stock buyback program and look at other ways to properly deploy capital to enhance returns. So, that's our focus.
Michael Rehaut: All right. Thanks so much.
Jon Jaffe: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Truman Patterson: Hi, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions. So, first question on land. You've mentioned a few times tightness in the land market. Do you all still plan on bringing your level of owned land down to three years and freeing up $3 billion in free cash flow? Or given the tightness do you plan on maybe holding on to a bit more owned land, help growing your community count a little bit more? And then just overall, could you just elaborate a little bit more in the land market, what you're seeing competition, especially post-COVID?
Rick Beckwitt: So, on the land hold side, we are laser-focused on bringing the land owned down to that three-year level or less. We're very focused, as Stuart said, of getting to that 50% owned option. And we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get there. The entire company, all of our land acquisition folks are laser-focused on achieving those goals.
Jon Jaffe: Yes. Truman, I'd add that during COVID, we didn't walk away from a single land deal. We didn't lose a single land deal. We postponed and pushed and so we -- in this quarter, started repurchased -- continuing that purchase of land. And as you saw, our percentages shifted to a greater percentage of control. So, even though we're in a constrained land market, our focus and execution is consistent with our stated goal and what Rick just described what we're driving towards.
Stuart Miller: Yes. We're in no way, Truman, changing our strategy, given the fact that the market is much, much stronger than any of us saw coming in the midst of COVID. The strategy continues to be migrating towards a just-in-time delivery model for land and we have been working and focusing on getting there. You've heard Rick and you've heard Jon talk about land relationships and programs in specific markets. We've been focused on land relationships and programs at the corporate level as well, in order to move and migrate towards that just-in-time delivery model, which includes a much greater emphasis on option land, much greater cash flow and deploying cash in areas where we're producing highest returns. And you can expect that going to be a continued strategy as we go forward.
Rick Beckwitt: If you think about it, Truman, when you're a landowner, one of the biggest drivers of your ability to make a cash flow on that asset is the builder's ability to work through those homesites on an accelerated basis. And given the fact that our cycle time is industry leading, we offer a great solution to a landowner on a takedown basis, because they make their money at the end of the deal, not at the beginning of the deal.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you for that. Jumping over to lumber and labor costs. I know lumber costs, I believe you said, increased about 100% during the quarter, but both have been key talking points in the industry's lumber futures have really been bounding around a lot. How do you all think about lumber costs and labor costs over the next two to three quarters? And what type of pricing do you need to cover these costs? It seems like you guys have been leaning a bit more on the price lever. So I imagine looking out a couple of quarters, you'll probably be able to cover this, but kind of rolling everything together.
Jon Jaffe: Truman, it's Jon. Well, lumber peaked really at the end of our quarter, end of August, and it has already come back about 19% in terms of future's -- future pricing. So, as we look forward, I would expect we'll probably see a decline of probably up 40%, maybe a little bit more as you roll forward about three months. And so, as we think about the impact, we will re-lock for Lennar or lumbar prices in October. It will impact about half of our closings in Q1 and about half in Q2, just because of different cycle times. And as I said, I expect that, the other half of Q2 will probably be lumber pricing. That's somewhere 50% to 60% of current levels. So we do see that coming down. As we look at our third quarter, our labor and material costs were pretty much flat both sequentially and year-over-year. And so, as Rick mentioned earlier, I think the team’s done a really great job of focusing on value engineering, on plan selection, to make sure that we can really manage our costs well. And particularly on the labor side, we continue to be laser-focused on our even flow strategy, which is just a huge benefit to the trades as they manage through the labor constraint. And let's say, we just continue to hit strides, as Rick mentioned, our cycle time is really strong in actually this quarter. It was enhanced over prior quarter and year-over-year. So all those focuses, I think, bode well for us. And as you mentioned, we are making sure that we're not selling out too far ahead, so we can take advantage of pricing power. And if we continue to match cost the way that we are, we should continue to those higher-margin results for us, as we spoke about in the beginning of the call.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you and good luck on the upcoming quarter.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is open.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you very much. I was wondering to what extent you believe the current uptick in housing represents a long-term demand trend as opposed to something more short term? And if there's any data, your mortgage company that perhaps gives you particular insights or perhaps the mix of spec, lower speculates and people perhaps buying further out than historically?
Rick Beckwitt: So this really goes back to the theme that we've had for the past many years and that is the one around production deficit. Is this a short-term phenomenon? Or has COVID ignited a sustainable expansion for housing? I think that there are attributes of what has happened in the recent past that might dissipate the migration from urban to suburban or from vertical to horizontal – might or might not dissipate. But at the end of the day, we still are left as a country – across the country with a deficit in dwellings in housing, both rental and for sale, both Multifamily and single-family growings for the population. We have seen millennials enter market. We have seen more move-out of a co-living space with their parents and enter the household formation and ownership market. I think we're going to continue to see these trends. People are valuing where they live, how they live in a much greater way. I think it was partially ignited by this moment with COVID, but it was destined to happen in time as family formation grew as post-COVID gave way to the realities of Family formation homeownership. So at the end of the day, a 10-year production deficit, which is what we've seen is in our view is going to be the fuel for an expansion that covers the next years not just for the short term and that's how we're viewing the market. That's how we're thinking about our future.
Jade Rahmani: And just a follow-up is, could you give the percentage of deliveries this quarter that were from spec? And comment on how that compared with a year ago or historically?
Rick Beckwitt: I don't have that information off hand, but I know Diane will be able to accumulate it and give it to you later. Yes, we'll pass it on later.
Diane Bessette: Yes.
Jade Rahmani: Thank you.
Diane Bessette: You bet. Let me just say that as part of that -- the answer to that question, Rick, Jon, do you want to comment on our inventory levels per community or across the board right now because they are at historic wells.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I'll tell you that right now, we're very lean on completed inventory per community, which is exactly where we want to be. It's around one or less on an aggregate basis on a community level basis, which means that we're keeping a highly efficient cash flow model going. We've got an assembly line that is producing homes to fill that gap. And we're exactly where we want to be on completed homes as well as under construction homes, right.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is open.
Matthew Bouley: Morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the Q4 new order guidance. Obviously, suggesting a bit of a deceleration in selling pace, which is normal seasonally, and I hear you around limiting sales intentionally as well. And the community count, in addition, it sounds like it steps lower a bit. So I understand all that, but just in light of how much stronger Q3 came in versus that guide? Is it fair to say that what I just mentioned is really the majority of the drivers? Or are you baking in a similar level of conservatism as you did last quarter around the macro and around the sustainability of housing strength?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, I think that, as we said in our remarks, our 16% year-over-year growth rate in new orders was well above our targeted rate. And we continue to maintain that targeted rate. It's a function of cash flow. It's a function of efficiency and effectiveness. It's also a function of what we believe we and the industry can actually put into production in the short-term as we start to ramp up to meet the demand that's in the marketplace. So as we looked ahead to our fourth quarter and we started to give guidance, perhaps there is an element of conservatism. But at the same time, we are managing to a more constrained growth rate than perhaps others are. We don't want to get that far out over our skis. We recognize what is doable relative to production levels and we simply don't want to get into the rat race of chasing something that is way out over the horizon. So it's a function of not just what the market is giving or what we can sell into the market, but also a function of what rate we can actually ramp up production and accommodate the request and the demand that's in the market right now.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. And one of the things you mentioned is when we pause the activity on both the starts and the development during COVID, it slowed down some of our newer communities from opening. So as you highlighted, community count is dipping in Q4. But as I said, in 2021, you'll see a rebuild of that.
Matthew Bouley: Okay, understood. Thanks for that color. And then I wanted to ask a question on the gross margin as well, I guess, a little bit of a higher level. So exiting 2020 over 23%, as you guided, it looks like Lennar pre-CalAtlantic, we haven't seen a level like that perhaps since 2016. So putting kind of that lumber volatility aside, should we be thinking that structurally Lennar gross margins can sustain at these type of levels? Or should we kind of understand that if there's any near-term pricing power or mix that's in there and we perhaps shouldn't get too carried away with assuming that persists? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: No, I think that's what we spotlighted in our opening remarks, is that we expect gross margins to be towards the higher levels for the foreseeable future. We say that given the backlog that we have and the expectations for how we will manage the business going forward, recognizing that there is an automatic caveat for where costs actually go and how aggressively they move, that will be in part determined by how quickly the industry moves to ramp up production. And so we have to leave that out there as a question mark. But I think that if you look at where Lennar is situated and how we see the future, you can expect that our margins are going to be migrating towards the higher side, and as we said, for the foreseeable future. Why don’t we take one more question?
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open.
Jack Micenko: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. And I guess I'll wrap it up with one bigger picture questions since most of might have asked. Stuart, 4Q 2018, I think the industry and collectively, most of us on the call are surprised at how quickly the new home demand market decelerated when rates moved up. And certainly, no one's thinking about that now, although there is some conversation about in place and coming back in. I'm curious how you think about this strategy shift in light of the risk there. Is it – are you comfortable that being smaller than – or sort of reining in the growth is somewhat defensive? How quickly operationally can you change direction if we see a spike in the 10 year? And just general thoughts around how to manage that, because you're clearly going and pushing price, curious how do you think about that as a risk scenario?
Stuart Miller: Yes. It would be easy to look at this as defensive positioning, but that's not at the root of our strategy. We've daylighted pretty consistently over the past quarters that our strategy is to manage our growth rate to focus on cash flow and returns and to deploy capital in that direction. I think that what you're seeing in the way that we're managing our business as the market has ramped up very quickly, is a controlled program of moving forward of growing our business and expanding our production. But doing so in an orderly fashion, focusing on returns and making sure that we're also focused on not selling way out of the head, dirt sales where costs are less certain, but instead, inventory homes that are under production that increase our inventory turns as well. So this is a very detailed strategy that we're very pleased with the way that we've executed. And it's not – as I said earlier, we think that the dynamics of the market right now are poised for a future growth rate that continues along the lines that you're seeing today. I'm not talking enough for Lennar, I'm talking for the industry overall. We think that the market is strong and is likely to remain strong, and we're likely to see an expansion for homebuilding for the foreseeable future.
Jack Micenko: Thank you.
Stuart Miller: You welcome, and I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we look forward to reporting back at the end of our fourth quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line, and enjoy the rest of your day.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Good morning, everyone, and thank you. This morning, I’m here in Miami once again with a scaled-down crew: Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, our Controller, Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services and of course Alex, who you just heard from. Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer is in Colorado, and Jon Jaffe in California, our President. And they're on the line with us this morning and we are all appropriately socially spaced. And as much as we have a lot of information that we're going to try to cover in our opening remarks, we're going to return to our traditional format. I'll give an overview; Jon and Rick will give operational insight and Diane will give financial information highlights and some limited guidance, and then we will attempt to answer as many of your questions as possible. But as you consider framing your questions, first of all, please limit to one question one follow-up. And remember that the national landscape continues to evolve, and the economy is still trying to reopen and normalize. In the current environment, there are still more guesses than there are clear answers. We will give you the guidance that we can but remember that we are all still trying to learn together as things unfold. So, let me begin. On March 27, a customer in Pennsylvania named Susan Pernice wrote us a most important and impactful letter. She said, since Pennsylvania's Governor Wolf's decision to shut down new construction, we are set to be homeless on April 20th. We have a Lennar home that was expected to be delivered on that day, in Hidden Meadows in Pennsylvania. There is a pending agreement for the sale of my current home on that day as well. She went on to say that this is all [Technical Difficulty] as I'm underemployed because of the shutdown, and I'm losing half my usual income. I'm asking you to please appeal Governor Wolf's decision on behalf of our family of six, to us the delivery of our new home is life sustaining, it is shelter for us, and it's imperative to our health and protection from COVID-19. This was the first of many letters to follow that detailed the dashed hopes and expectations of Lennar customers that fell victim to the interruptions caused by COVID-19 and the economic shutdown that caught many off guard. The letter from Ms. Pernice detailed for us that homebuilding was in fact an essential service at this critical time and that shelter for families was life-sustaining and critically important to the wellbeing of our communities. This was a very big and important change in our world and in the world of our customers, where families live and how families lived was essential. Having the space to "stay-at-home" was essential. The safety and security of the family home in a welcome community was essential. And the timing, the rental term at an end, where the old home sold to someone else or leaving roommates or temporary quarters, or the arrival in or transfer to a new city, the timing to move in to the home being built was essential. To protect our business, we had already been making the case that homebuilding companies should be able to continue to build, but with Susan Pernice’s plea for help and many others that follows it was now essential. The federal government, most states and most municipalities across the country ultimately to me deemed housing an essential service and enables home builders to continue building, selling and delivering homes to our customers and -- to our customers. As an essential service, we kept our doors open and serve communities across the country. Our second quarter started with great concern as the economy was shuttering and unemployment was starting to rise. The story of Ms. Pernice and the designation of homebuilding as an essential service deems to shed light on how the overall market conditions evolve to what we are experiencing right now. While the economy is still trying to reboot after shutdown, the homebuilding industry only stalled for mid-March through April and began its reboot earlier than most. Homes had to be completed and delivered, so people could stay-at-home in the shelters that they weren't expecting. Otherwise, they would be homeless. Keeping in step with this necessity, we focused on completing and delivering homes in backlog. But alongside those who needed their homes delivered, many more began to reconsider the essential and aspirational nature of shelter and desired to or needed to purchase and move. Yesterday's notion of a mobile society had its mobility taken away, people reconsidered. The all but certain migration to large congested cities as the preferred lifestyle over suburban was reversed and people reconsidered. Preference for transient, high-rise, shared amenity rentals, over stable, owned single family homes with yard was reversed, people reconsidered. Second homes became a vital refuge and home offices with soundproofing and separation became the newest amenity. The market was quickly reconsidering its needs, wishes and wants, and the homebuilders have seen this narrative unfold in real time. Lennar’s second quarter numbers are strong and indicate a strong recovery to-date. Ended the quarter with $517 million of net earnings or $1.65 per share, compared to $422 million and $1.30 per share last year, up 27% over last year. Our closings were flat over last year, but would have been higher except for certain stalled markets and the initial shock from the shutdown. Our margins were up, but mostly represented sales that had taken place in the months before the shutdown. But, what is more impressive is that our backlog margins are even higher, as sales have strengthened and momentum has built and time has passed. And our SG&A is impressively lower and reflects the many cost reducing initiatives that we have daylighted in prior calls. We are mindful, however, that one or two months in a row does not yet define a sustainable trend. Although the market currently feels very strong, we are in the early stages. We know that low interest rates and short supply are driving demand and pricing power. We also know the changing customer preferences are driving strong demand for new homes. Still, we are giving guidance today with some elements of caution. We know we are currently picking up demand that was postponed from a stalled selling season. And we don't know yet how high unemployment and an economy still wrestling to open will moderate this recovery in the future. Additionally, there has been disruption. When the economy shut down, we reacted and slowed land purchases, land development and starts. As sales started to recover, we restarted land development and starts. Accordingly, we will have somewhat fewer deliveries in the third and fourth quarters because of the mid-March through April stall. Nevertheless, we expect other metrics and Company initiatives to continue to be very strong through the end of the year. This quarter showcased our Company coming together to consider people first in all circumstances while at the same time operationally we reengineered our business for the current environment, while we improved earnings, cash flows and returns. Hard work and hard decisions to find new paths forward, technology and tenacity paved the path to new ways to construct our business. We've adjusted and changed the way we manage our business. As the management team, we learned to operate from outside the office while using technology to stay connected like never before. Although, we have managed from a distance, through daily video meetings our Company leaders stayed close to operations across all 38 of our divisions and guided with consistent messaging and a very steady leadership hand. As a connected management team, our homebuilding and financial services teams utilized our significant investments and especially our head start in technology to incorporate social distancing, while enhancing our customers’ experiences as well as our operations and efficiency for the current environment and for the future as well. We focused on and reconfigured every facet of our business to adapt to the changed environment. We have changed and we have adjusted the plane, while it was still flying. Let me give you some detail on that. As part of our rapid migration toward technologies that enable communication and collaboration, Diane Bessette and Jeff McCall have accelerated our push to modernize our reporting structures, both for internal and external reporting. Data is being collected more effectively into a common data model, and that data is being turned into real time information that is being standardized and consumed across the platform, creating efficiencies and cost reduction. Standardized reports are being discussed at daily management meetings as our management team is learning together how to use and get the most out of our enhanced technology. Note that our earnings call is taking place just 12 business days after the end of the quarter. We are using technology to better roll up revenues and access our cash. That's better and faster than we used to be, but Diane, it is not as fast and as efficient as we are going to be. Starting tomorrow, we are back to work looking forward, enhancing systems and building efficiencies rather than still working on reporting last quarter a week later. We also changed our home selling process. While Rick will give additional color on current market conditions and our results shortly, in marketing and sales, we advanced and enhanced our digital marketing platform to enable engagement with our customers any way they choose. Although our lennar.com website -- I'm sorry. Through our lennar.com website, customers now have the choice to deal with us in one of four ways: Number one; working traditionally by visiting a Welcome Home Center and interacting with one of our professional new home consultants; or number two, working with our new home consultants to a re-imagined, fully digital experience that has been designed for the current environment; or number three, interacting digitally and viewing product on their computer at home using three dimensional pictorial tours of models that are complete; or soon, a Modsy three dimensional tour of homes that are designed, but not yet built for models; or number four, they can take a do-it-yourself, self guided tour of our existing models, all alone and on their own. We rewired every one of our model homes across the country, over a two-week period to enable our customers to get a code, to access digital entry of our models on their own for self guided tour, no contacts, no risk and all alone they can interact with Lennar digitally or through phone or face to face -- or face time, review products, visit models, sign a contract, and send a deposit, all digitally. Our digital experience is getting better and better and will continue to improve quickly, now that we have our associates and our customers accustomed to these tools. Customers are finding new ways to purchase and we're finding new ways to joyfully engage with our customers. As our digital experience is constantly refined and improved more of our customers will choose and enjoy a more independent and frictionless experience as they engage with Lennar. In fact, just looking at self guided tours for the first two weeks of June over May, we have seen an increase of 20% in self guided tours alone. As an example of our digital engagement, take a look at our, lennar.com today, we are seeing more and more that our customers want to find a home with a home office, not just a repurposed bedroom, but they want an office that's at home, but feels separate and quiet. It's apart from the barking dogs and the daily activities of the household, but it is at home. We've redesigned our next-gen home products, home within a home concept that we are now offering as a home office within a home. It's part of the home, but separate. It's attached, but insulated for soundproofing. We don't have a model yet to show, but we have a Modsy three dimensional design to explore. Modsy is one of our portfolio investment companies that we believe is best-of-breed in creating three dimensional renderings that look and feel real when we don't have the real thing to show. We are working with Modsy to improve our ability to demonstrate the dreams that we have not yet been able to build. We are, we can, and we will ramp up our digital abilities and help our customers dream with us as we create the home of their future. Applying for a mortgage and closing a home has never been easier at Lennar also. We have accelerated our digital platform to accommodate customers’ desires to close on their new home, but to close without health risk or social contacts. Our mortgage application and approval process has never been easier or more digital. With our Blend enabled application, another portfolio company, and many detailed digital improvements designed in-house in loan officer engagement and loan processing, our customer experience is improving every quarter. The forms are simpler, the information is entered once and the updates to information are automated. Our customers are happier, our associates are more effective, and our costs are coming down. In title and escrow, we are now closing homes with little or no contact as well with an increased focus on the health and safety of both our associates and our customers. We have increased the number of digital closings with digital documents signing and where possible digital notarization. We are also implementing a virtual new home orientation process, so our homebuyers can walk and view their completed home via FaceTime. We can even give keys to the front door digitally with a code for self access, while we leave the sanitized keys in the kitchen. Where we must physically notarize documents, which is still required in some states, we created an express drive-thru closing program. All paperwork is signed digitally before arrival and our customers can finalize closing their home with a notarization from their car in just 15 minutes. Lennar Financial Services just keeps getting better with faster, more frictionless service for our customers, easier engagement for our associates and more profitability for the Company. This quarter, LFS contributed $151 million to the Company, while $61 million of that related to a deferred profit attributable to the deconsolidation to deconsolidating the sale of our retail title business over a year ago, approximately $90 million of the contribution is attributable to efficient operations and market conditions. This is a record quarter for LFS as they continue to lead the way for the Company on innovation and enhanced customer experience. We are also building homes differently and Jon will give some more color here as well. Construction is finally turning digital as we have turned our sites to using technology to centrally schedule construction at the division level. Over the past month, we've been rolling out a technology oriented scheduling program to create efficiencies across our production platform. This will enhance an even flow execution, give greater predictability to our trade partners relative to scheduling and logistics, and it will ultimately reduce construction costs as well. The need for effective and efficient communication over the past month has enabled us to advance the education and rewiring of our field operation as we and our trade partners struggle to keep job sites open and jobs filled. Most of our construction sites have been -- have continued to be active and fully functional to date, and we have not yet seen a significant impact on our trades or our supply chain. We are very-focused on the health and safety of our trades and have established clear protocols with this in mind. We have been in constant communication with our trade partners to help them implement their own safety standards and understand the steps we are taking. We have begun using FaceTime and other technologies to facilitate inspections, and we suspended all non-emergency customer care to protect our associates, customers and trade partners and use a DIY, do-it-yourself model to help customers help themselves where possible. Although it's awkward and difficult to talk about operational and financial results and successes, in the wake of a quarter that has been defined by health fears, economic shutdown, job loss, personal struggles, and social injustice, we are proud to say that we have managed with a steady hand with a constructive and measured leadership and with focus on how we can be a constructive force at a difficult time. On reflection, I can say with conviction that we have done well while we have also done good. While the second quarter has been a quarter of tremendous success for Lennar, sadly, as the quarter ended and health crisis began to subside, social justice became a dominant and critical concern, both nationally and at Lennar. Our leadership team and our associates locked arms across the Company and stood tall to lean in and enhance and expand our already central focus on inclusion and diversity across the country. Like many across the country, we focused on the senseless killing of George Floyd as a call to action to be better than this and to commit to be an ever better version of ourselves. While our Lennar Charitable Foundation gave generously, notably in honor of our fallen associate, Pete Anderson for homelessness, our Chief Human Resources Officer, Andrew Davis, led focused discussion and engagement to match strategies to improve. This work and vow continues. As we look ahead, we remain proud of Lennar's continued and consistent commitment to do well and to do good as we lead with a people first focus. With a strong balance sheet and a strong social and moral commitment, we are confident that we will emerge from today's distress even better and stronger than before. Accordingly, while the somewhat unpredictable environment in our country will evolve over time, we believe that we will be very well positioned through hard work, focused leadership and innovative technologies to offset future headwinds and drive our business to new heights. And by the way, remember Susan Pernice who I mentioned and quoted in the beginning. While Governor Wolf was one of the very few who did not lift restrictions on homebuilding during the stay-at-home order, we were able with the assistance from the borough or municipality, to complete Ms. Pernice’s home. She and her family of six moved into their home on April 29th. She and her family were able to delay the closing of their home once we gave them an updated completion date. Today, she and her family are part of the Lennar family, and we're proud that we were able to assess. And with affection and appreciation for the Lennar associates, who answered her plea, she sends her regards to them and everyone listening today. We're very proud of the quick actions that we've taken to carefully manage our business through these difficult times. I would like to personally thank all Lennar associates across our platform for their commitment, for their trust, and for their dedication during this very difficult time. I also want to thank our trade partners who have worked collaboratively with us to ensure not only a safe and healthy home, but a quality and affordable home. And finally, I want to thank Ms. Pernice and all of our customers for understanding that we are working hard for them to adjust, to learn and to evolve so that we can safely deliver the home of their dreams. So, with that, let me turn it over to Rick.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. We entered our second quarter with a strong housing market and solid economic fundamentals. This combined with low mortgage rates and a limited supply of homes gave us continued sales momentum and pricing power. However, all of this changed in the second half of March through April as the nation dealt with the impacts of COVID-19. While residential construction was designated an essential service in most of our markets, the severe and immediate shutdown of economic activity across the country began to negatively impact our business. As a result of the pandemic, our sales orders declined significantly in late March, and continued at a reduced rate through April. Despite a strong start in March, new orders for the month were down 10% from the prior year. April marked the low point during the second quarter with orders decreasing 29% from the prior year and our cancellation rate peaking at 23%. Notwithstanding this slowdown, our team did an excellent job selling homes, be it by appointment, self-guided tours or virtual tours. We also focused on controlling sales prices and managing backlog expectations, which benefited our gross margins in the second quarter and will benefit our gross margins in the back half of the year. In May, we saw an influx of new homebuyers wanting to take advantage of extremely low mortgage rates and move out of apartments in densely-populated areas and homes they were sharing with friends and family during the pandemic. We also heard increased conviction from people wanting to buy a new, safe and clean home versus an existing home. In May, our new orders increased each week sequentially and were up 7% over the prior year. Our cancellation rate in May also dropped from 18% -- dropped to 18% from the 23% high in April. More importantly, our increase in sales was generally achieved while raising prices and reducing incentives throughout the month of May. We rarely comment on sales activity outside of the quarter we are reporting. However, given these fluid market dynamics, I will give you some insight on June. For the first two weeks of June, our new were up 20% over the same period last year. We believe that part of this increase was the recapture of sales activity lost during this year’s spring selling season. And there will be a reversion to typical seasonality as we move through the rest of our fiscal year. Recognizing the risks around high unemployment rates and the current trends towards a recurrence in COVID cases, we have not projected that this level of activity will continue in the next two quarters. However, should this pace extend longer, we plan to carefully match sales with measured and consistent price increases to further enhance our gross margins. We also know that our sales activity in the next two quarters will be somewhat constrained by reduced community openings as we slow development activity to conserve cash in the second quarter, and many municipalities shut down their offices and did not issue permits and approvals to start development and sales. Currently, our community count is down 6% year-over-year. I’d now like to give you a little color on our markets across the country. It really falls into three categories: One, markets not really impacted by the pandemic; two, markets that were impacted but have recovered or where the recovery is well underway; and three, markets that were impacted but where the recovery is still lagging. Notwithstanding these categories, in all of our markets, we saw a sequential increase in sales activity from April to May and continued strength during the first two weeks of June. During our second quarter, we had eight markets that had little to no impact from the pandemic. These include Jacksonville, Coastal Carolinas, Indianapolis, Maryland, Nashville, Dallas, San Antonio and Utah. While most of these markets had stay-at-home ordinance in place, we picked up considerable market share through better execution as many of the builders in these markets shut down their operations. Many of these markets also benefited from low COVID-19 infection rates, so business activity was less impacted. In addition, each of these markets benefited from low inventory levels. And while traffic was down, conversion rates were extremely high as buyers were highly motivated to purchase a safe new home. In Dallas and San Antonio, two of our larger markets, we continued to benefit from our move down the price curve and by having quick move-in homes. Category two includes 18 markets that were impacted by the pandemic, but have either recovered or are well on their way to the recovery. Starting in the East, these markets include New Jersey, North Carolina, Southeast and Southwest Florida, Tampa, Orlando, Chicago, Minnesota, Houston and Austin, Colorado, Arizona, the Inland Empire, San Diego, Central Valley, California, Sacramento, Reno and the Pacific Northwest. While we continued to sell homes and offered limited incentives in each of these markets, municipality shutdowns and lower consumer confidence caused a significant decline in both traffic and sales from mid-March through April. However, across the board, all of these markets started to recover beginning the last week of April and have continued to improve through May and into June. In our larger Florida markets, demand in May and the first part of June rebounded strongly. Southeast Florida and Tampa saw increased demand from renters and customers wanting to move from densely populated areas to purchase detached single-family homes. Southwest Florida, which is a big second home active adult market, saw increased demand from customers fleeing the COVID-impacted areas in the Northeast to the more safe, South Florida market. Raleigh, Charlotte and Atlanta were hit hard initially. However, all of these markets bounced back as business activity resumed in May. In each of these markets, we benefited from the return of the cultural buyer who wanted the safety of a new COVID-free home. These markets also experienced increased demand from buyers looking to relocate from the Northeast. The Houston market has been the biggest surprise. While hit hard between mid-March and mid-April, our sales bounced back in May and June, as demand for entry-level products outpaced the fall in oil price. While unemployment is still high due to reduced oil and gas investment, we’re extremely well positioned with almost 50% of our communities priced below $300,000. The activity in Houston reflects the incredible diversification that happened in the Houston economy away from oil and gas. Austin was the slowest market in Texas to recover. This was in large part due to a stricter shutdown ordinance imposed by the city. However, sales started to recover in May and have increased in the first part of June. The Austin economy is strong with over 7,200 technology companies spurring job growth and demand. Moving to Colorado. Colorado is on the road to recovery. And while not fully recovered, the local economy is strong and diverse with limited new home inventory and low resale listings. In May, our traffic increased and sales rebounded from April lows, June has seen a more significant increase in both sales and pricing power. The Phoenix market entered the pandemic as one of the strongest markets in the country, and while impacted, it has bounced back strongly. Our sales steadily improved through May and were really strong in the first part of June. We continue to benefit from a broad product offering with many lower priced communities. The Pacific Northwest has recovered nicely. In spite of the state shutdown and Washington temporarily shutting down construction, we continued to sell and close homes. Demand has improved significantly in May and has continued into June. In California, the Inland Empire is the strongest market. While the market took a hit in April, it came back strong in both May and June. The Inland Empire has always been the affordable alternative to the more coastal areas. With low mortgage rates, buyers had flocked back to the market. Most of these have been renters or frontline workers fighting the pandemic. Category three includes four markets that were significantly impacted by the pandemic and where the recovery is lagging the rest of the U.S. These markets include the Bay Area, Orange County, California, Las Vegas and Orlando. The Bay Area market was one of the first markets impacted by COVID-19, and with aggressive government shutdowns, the market just shut down. Consumer confidence lost, demand significantly slowed. While lower pricing -- while the lower priced single-family market has recovered, the higher density, higher priced attached market still needs to gain some traction. Orange County, California was one of the weakest markets going into the pandemic and is still lagging the other markets on the way out. The combination of reduced demand from Chinese buyers and government shutdowns really chilled the market. While sales more than doubled sequentially from April to May, the market still needs to stabilize further. Las Vegas was really impacted by a closedown of the casinos and a huge decline in tourism. Unemployment peaked at 30%. While most of this is furloughed and temporary job loss, the casinos, which just reopened, need to rebuild their businesses before things get back to normal. Despite this, we’ve seen a rebound in both traffic and sales in May and the first part of June. Orlando is starting to come back. With the shutdown of international travel, reduced domestic flights and the closure of theme parks, the local economy really slowed down. Sales declined sharply in April, but we saw a bounce back in May and June. With the recent and planned reopening of the theme parks, we’re optimistic that this will -- this market will pick up in demand very quickly. I hope this gives you a sense of how we’re positioned in our local markets. While we have a few markets that are lagging, most have rebounded. From a macro standpoint, the market is strong with limited inventory, pent-up demand, aided by low mortgage rates. In this environment, we’ve been very-focused on balancing pace and price. And while we’ve increased our sales pace for community, we’ve been vigilant in raising prices, lowering incentives and reducing our brokerage spend. With low mortgage rates, the impact of our price increases has had a minimal impact on affordability, and this should give us a decent runway to improve gross margins in the coming quarters. And now, I’d like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thank you, Rick. Today, I’ll start with a discussion of our land and balance sheet strategies, beginning with a look at the actions we took during the second quarter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Stuart mentioned, we paused our land purchases, land development activity and home starts. We used our daily management call to quickly implement this strategy across all of our divisions. We were able to pause all of the land acquisitions that we wanted to. And due to the strength of relationships with our land sellers, we did not walk away from any deposits or lose any deals. What we did was to pause takedowns for 60 to 90 days in order to give us time to understand the impact of the pandemic and the associated government shutdown. At the same time, we also slowed our land development spend. This was done on a community-by-community basis by determining in real-time the market demand for each community and the economic logic associated with stopping and restarting. We also looked at our planned starts, again, evaluating each community’s market demand if the particular home was in backlog and the mortgage status, if it was sold or if the home was unsold. We paused about 4,100 starts in the quarter or 27% of what was planned. Given this pause in land spend and fewer starts in our second quarter, results for our land and cash positions were temporarily altered by the actions we took. We ended the quarter with 3.9 years of land owned compared to 4.5 years in Q2 of 2019 and with an increased percentage of homesites option of 32%, up from 25% last year. The combination of slowing our land spend in the quarter, strong closings and executing on our strategy of building strategic relationships to option homesites resulted in significant cash flow generation, as we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet and zero borrowed against our revolver. Additionally, we repaid $300 million of senior notes and ended the quarter with total debt to capitalization of 31.2% versus 38.3% the prior year. Despite the daily intensity it took to manage through the challenges of the pandemic, we still maintained our focus on becoming a land-light company and are on track to be migrating both our supply of land owned down to 3 years from the current 3.9 years and to control 50% of our homesites through options as compared to the current 32% by the end of fiscal 2021. We continue to work on and develop additional strategic relationships that are designed to facilitate our reaching these goals. Just as effectively as we paused, as we saw markets recover, we have recommenced land acquisition, land development and home starts. We are confident we will have the homesites necessary to start and deliver the homes we are projecting in our guidance. Now, I’ll turn to our direct construction costs and the value of our Builder of Choice program with our trade partners. Simply put, our approach has been to understand what drives efficiencies from our trade partners’ perspective that we can work openly with them to lower costs without hurting their margins. But, let me be clear, this work is anything but simple. It’s beyond the rolling up of our sleeves to do the hard work required. It’s about building trust. It’s all about our trade partners trusting that we will change the way we manage our business for their benefit, and we will do what we say we’re going to do. This takes commitment from them and us, and it takes time. Once this trust is established, it allows us to work together with our trade partners to remove cost from the supply chain. A good example of this is our intense focus on even-flow production. Using technology, our field is connected in real-time with our office and in turn, our office with our trade partners. This connectivity enables construction to be on schedule and for schedules to be reliable. The predictability this provides our trade partners allows them to eliminate overtime, which can save as much as $500 per home. This focus produced the fifth straight quarter where direct construction cost as a percent of revenues fell. In Q2, costs were at 44.5% of revenues, 50 and 200 basis-point improvement sequentially and year-over-year respectively. This 200 basis-point improvement in cost as a percent of revenue resulted from the combination of pricing power and lower cost was the driver of our gross margin improvement of 150 basis points, which more than offset the increased cost of land and fees. In our second quarter, our cost per square foot was down 130 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. The cumulative effect of our strategic trade partner collaborations on removing cost from the supply chain, ongoing value engineering workshops which are now done virtually and a strong purchasing organization led by Paul Dodge and Kemp Gillis have led us to continuous -- have led to continuously lower costs which we believe will be sustainable given the buy-in from our trade partners and our Builder of Choice model. I would like to highlight that these cost efficiencies have been achieved in an environment of increased labor costs due to the labor shortage combined and at the same time with the shift in product to smaller-lower priced homes. The math of smaller square footage and lower average sales price normally increases both costs as a percentage of revenues and cost per square foot. However, with our focus of working collaboratively with our trade partners to remove costs from the supply chain, we've accomplished lowering both of these cost metrics. With respect to labor shortage, I want to note that the homebuilding industry, through the leading builders of America is initiating a program to attract those who have been displaced by the pandemic. The program will offer training for positions with the trade, presents the opportunity for an easing of the labor constraint. Accordingly, as this occurs, the cost of labor should ease as well. As all these efforts take costs out of the supply chain, are critical to be able to build homes that consumers can afford. With respect to the impact of the pandemic, what happened throughout the quarter demonstrated the strength of our trade partner relationships. There are four areas where this working relationship is evident. First is the work we did to help our trade partners navigate the CARES Act. The act pay revisions for Paycheck Protection Program loans that have the potential of keeping many of our trade partners and their associates afloat. Unfortunately, the language in the legislation was very confusing, and nobody really knew what to do. So, Lennar took action. Led by our Vice President of Tax, Mike Petrolino along with the help of senior partners at Deloitte, we quickly put together an overview of the act for the benefit of trade partners. And on Sunday, March 29, just one and a half days after the act was signed into law, we held two conference calls with over 5,000 of our trade partners in attendance. We spent the day walking them through the act and answering their questions. Next, with our commitment to the safety of our associates, customers and trade partners on our communities. We paused our warranty work as it was not safe to be sending workers into our homes. We then repositioned our customer care associates to be COVID-19 safety officers on all of our job sites. Working with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Pascal, we produced safety guidelines and checklists to ensure everyone's safety while construction continues. This was critical to ensure the treatment of housing as essential. In fact, we surveyed our trade and found that statistically they contracted the COVID-19 virus at a much lower rate than the general population. We provided this information to various state and local agencies as they evaluated the issue allowing home construction to continue. Through these efforts and more, we fulfilled our commitment to keep our associates, customers and trade partners safe while continuing to deliver homes to eagerly awaiting families. Thirdly, we worked closely with our trade partners to help us where they could to temporarily reduce costs to make sure we could continue to sell homes as the pandemic took hold and the economy went into shutdown mode. Our trade partners stepped up allowing us to aggressively buy down interest rates, which helps jumpstart our sales. Finally, with the help of our trade partners and the focus work of our national purchasing team, we navigated the various pandemic related supply chain disruptions, both in China and then in Mexico. For each manufacturer, we classified the risk level, regularly monitored their current inventories, developed plan Bs and plan Cs and provided home and community level forecasting to give detailed view of our needs. The primary disruptions occurred in Mexican factory impacting cabinets, door hardware, appliances and interiors. We successfully managed through all these disruptions to avoid any delays. As of today, all of our manufacturers are open and with improving capacity. I want to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our trade partners and the Lennar team for working so effectively through this crisis. Together, we’re able to navigate this unprecedented time and deliver homes, essential homes to families across America. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to spend just a few minutes reviewing the highlights from our second quarter. For many decades, we have operated with a balance sheet first philosophy and a strong focus on liquidity. And so for today, that's where I'd like to start. As noted, with our laser focus on generating cash and preserving cash, we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion of cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $2.45 billion revolving credit facility, thereby providing total liquidity of $3.85 billion. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio was 31.2% versus 38.3% in the prior year. This is the lowest debt to total capital ratio since Q1 of 2007. As we look at the balance of the year, we have a very manageable level of debt maturities with only $300 million due in November after having repaid $300 million in May. In the last two years, we have repaid $2.5 billion of senior notes from cash flow generated from operations. Our stockholders' equity increased to $17 billion and our book value per share was $52.98. And so, with those balance sheet highlights, let me briefly review our operating performance. Stuart, Rick and Jon provided most of the details. So, here's a quick summary of the highlights. The new orders, we ended the quarter down 10%. Our sales pace was 3.5% for the quarter compared to 3.7% in the prior year. Our cancellation rate was 19% compared to 15% in the prior year. For the quarter, deliveries were relatively flat year-over-year as we remained intensely focused on cash generation. Our gross margin was 21.6%, as Jon mentioned, primarily as a result of our focus on construction costs, and our SG&A was 8.3% as a result of creating an efficient platform. And the 8.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A percentage we've ever achieved. And our financial services team also executed at high levels. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $81 million compared to $43 million in the prior year. During the quarter, we sold our legacy servicing portfolio for a gain of $5 million and eliminated potential future liabilities. Additionally, mortgage earnings primarily benefited from a higher capture rate, 82% versus 75% last year, a lower percentage of cash buyers during the quarter, a higher percentage of locks on deliveries that will occur in Q3 as a result of record low interest rates and a continued decrease in loan origination costs. Title operating earnings were $17 million compared to $15 million in the prior year. Title earnings increased due to an increase in profit per closed order, which was driven by cost reductions. LMF Commercial had an operating loss of $6 million compared to operating earnings of $6 million the prior year, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 effects on the capital market. However, during the quarter, we were pleased to be part of one securitization though at a lower than normal margins, but still positive. Additionally, during the quarter, we deconsolidated stage title, the process required us to perform a fair market value analysis of our interest, which resulted in a $61 million gain. And two other final items. In the category of land sales, we recorded a $23 million write-off of costs related to the Concord naval base located northeast of San Francisco since we are not moving forward with this development. In the category of Lennar Other, we recorded a $25 million charge, which was our share of a valuation adjustment related to the Rialto legacy funds. This adjustment was primarily a result of the disruption in the capital markets as a result of the COVID-19 environment. So with that quick summary, let me provide you with detailed guidance for Q3 and high-level guidance for our core operations in Q4. So, starting with Q3 and homebuilding. We expect new orders between 12,800 and 13,000. We expect to deliver between 13,200 and 13,400 homes. Our average sales price should be in the range of $380,000 to $385,000 as we continue to move down the price curve. We expect to continue to maintain our gross margins in the range of 21.5% to 21.75%, and our SG&A should be in the range of 8.3% to 8.5%. And for the combined homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other categories, we expect a loss of approximately $20 million to $30 million due to the current delay of land sales activities. Turning to our ancillary businesses. We believe our financial services earnings will be approximately $70 million, based on more normalized metrics in the third quarter. For our multifamily segment, we expect a loss of approximately $5 million. And for the Lennar Other category, we expect to be about breakeven. We expect corporate G&A to be about $90 million for the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.1%, and the average share count should be approximately 309 million shares. This guidance should produce an EPS range of $1.46 to $1.59. And now, let me provide a few high-level estimates for Q4 for homebuilding and financial services. For homebuilding, we expect new orders between 12,000 and 12,250. We expect to deliver between 14,300 and 14,600 homes. Our Q4 volume will be impacted, as we mentioned, by the slowdown in starts during our second quarter. Our average sales price should be in the range of $380,000, and we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 21.75% to 22% and our SG&A around 8%. And for financial services, we believe we will have operating earnings of about $60 million. We hope you find this guidance helpful. And with that, let's turn it over to the operator.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Strong results, and thanks for the additional disclosure and getting everything to us so quickly, in particular. My first question relates to the margin. Well, actually you gave really good strong margin guidance. But, I guess one surprising issue was your orders looking in 3Q and 4Q to be down year-over-year. I know you sort of addressed it a little bit and said that -- you made some comments about the second wave concerns. You also talked about lower community count. And I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of the second wave concerns are baked into your outlook? If these second wave concerns, let's say, were not to materialize, could you actually see order growth remain up double digits like it's running in June, or would do you actually think that the supply constrain issues that you've got and community count shortfall would continue to keep pressure on your order growth and that you would just simply raise price more aggressively in the face of that?
Stuart Miller: So, thanks Steve. And first of all, let me say, I know that we packed a lot of information into our opening remarks. And so, we're going to take Q&A for a little bit longer. But thanks for the question. Rick daylighted that our sales, as we came into June, are up over 20%. And we're not giving exact numbers because we really don't want to get carried away with it, but the market is strong. And just the discussions with our divisions really across the country is that they're seeing really strong activity. It's hard to tell what portion of that is a push forward or push into the third quarter -- the second quarter traditional selling season, and what represents a rethinking of where people live and how they want to live and what -- how sticky that's going to be. So what you're seeing in our guidance is a clear understanding that the market is strong. And yes, it can remain strong as we go forward. There is a supply constraint. Interest rates are low and are likely to stay low for a period of time. The economy is certainly looking for ways to recover, and with recovery and reduced unemployment rates, there is cause for optimism. I would think that the housing market and its strength will contribute to job creation, absorbing some of the people who might have lost their jobs more permanently. So there are reasons for optimism, and we do think that sales can be stronger. We are going to balance between pricing and pace as we move through the third quarter and into the fourth. On the other side, we inject some conservatism in our projections or in our guidance because we're still learning. We're still looking at how the economy will actually resolve the disruption that it's gone through, how jobs will come back. There is certainly the cloud of social unrest right now. So, there are questions out there and moderating factors. There is upside in our numbers, particularly on sales. There is also caution. And we're trying to do with that balance and be straight as we look at giving guidance for going forward.
Jon Jaffe: And Steve, it's Jon. Let's remember, as I said, we intentionally pulled back on about 4,100 starts, and we're going to manage carefully not to be selling too far forward into the future. And so, we’re going to control the sales pace, even though the market might allow us to sell at a faster pace, we're going to make sure that we match to our production pace.
Stephen Kim: Yes, particularly, when you have a rising price environment, selling too far upfront doesn't make a lot of sense. So yeah, that conservatism is welcome and understood. Second question relates to what some of the things you touched on. There are a lot of societal factors that have been changing more rapidly than I think we've ever seen, and a lot of those are really positive it seems like for your business and for homebuilding in general, the suburban versus urban living preference, so many things, home offices, recreation space, outdoor living, etc., etc. I'm interested in your perspective about the drivers to these changes and their permanence, or at least their likelihood -- the likelihood that some of these drivers will last long enough for you to make investments that will pay off over a period of years, not months. I'm thinking like things like the social distancing thing that we've all gotten used to, how long you think that's going to drive some changes in the kind of housing that people want? Maybe increased urban safety concerns that you've touched on. These are -- increased work from home. Which of these things do you think are going to be temporary? Which do you think are going to be lasting and give you the opportunity to actually invest to capitalize on them? And are you doing that yet, making those investments?
Stuart Miller: So let me just give a quick response and ask Rick to chime in, in a second. But look, there is no way in the middle of crisis to figure out what's going to be short term and what's going to be long term, and we're going to feel our way through this. There are certain elements that are clearly going to be with us for a very long period of time, and that is the migration to technologies that we are all learning to use, that are enhancing the customer experience that I detailed in my portion. But relative to the trends of migrating from cities to suburban, mobility and that having been put on pause and some of the other questions out there, how long term they're going to be, we're going to have to wait and see. Some of the elements like work-from-home and having an office at home, we think that these are going to have some stickiness. So, Rick, why don't you weigh in on that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I agree with Stuart. We're going to have to see how things evolve. But we do have some trends that are really positive. Going into this, we had the millennial population that was going through wanting to move to the suburbs, having babies and things like that. On top of this, we've seen a mass flight from highly populated areas where people just really don't want to be confined in small spaces. So we are really positioned well and have been investing in opportunities and contracting for land to take advantage of this. One of the most interesting dynamics that we're looking at is, with the dramatic fall in oil prices, people have the ability, if they need to commute, to commute at much more affordable levels. But many times now, since you can work at home, you don't need to drive anywhere. So, that really opens up a vast amount of opportunities for us as we look down the road.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Great, thanks very much guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Next?
Operator: Next we have Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman: Good morning. And I apologize, but I did unfortunately get kicked off the call, so I missed much of the opening comments. But first, I just want to recognize and congratulate all of you for navigating such incredibly challenging times and having such a spectacular financial performance. It really was remarkable. So I'm not just saying it to say it, but it really is something we should all acknowledge, so first and foremost. It's difficult to ask the questions that I have with not repeating a lot of what you've already commented on, but you guys have a very unique perspective, having a multi-family business. And we hear a lot from the publicly traded REITs that they are not seeing flight from the urban core to the suburbs. Their turnover numbers are actually only up marginally but still at extremely depressed levels. So it's very difficult to triangulate a lot of what we're hearing about with people wanting and your quote in the press release about people leaving the urban dense areas for space, safety, all the things that we've talked about and taking advantage of record low mortgage rates and wanting to be in a home where they have the ability to have all of those factors today that are socially important for living in safety for the families, technology. So maybe you can give us some data around some of the things that you've noted. I promise I'll stop talking a minute, but when you look at -- you hear builders -- we ask them, where is all this demand coming from? It's crazy strong. It's everything against what we would have expected in a massive unemployment environment we're in. And their answer is, well, really nothing has changed. It's the same reasons people have been buying is just accelerating. But there is no question, more renters are converting to homeowners. So maybe try to triangulate a little bit for us what you're seeing from maybe entry level versus move-up. Are people leaving New York City and buying move-up homes? Are you seeing maybe some delineation between product categories? You mentioned entry level being really strong. I'll stop because I can keep going, and I'm sure I'm confusing you with too much at once. So I'll just stop there.
Stuart Miller: I know that we set the stage with long-winded introductions and you certainly carried it forward. So, your next question is going to have to be shorter. But -- so, let me say that there is no story. There are many stories, and many of the stories are playing out. Just to give you some data, I was talking this morning to our Southeast Florida division, Carlos Gonzalez, and Carlos enthusiastically said that 31% of his sales most recently have come from the City of Miami to the suburban areas of Miami, migrating to the suburban areas. So, we are hearing that kind of empirical data that is just starting to percolate up where we're starting to see that some of these stories are really playing out, the migration from rental communities to single-family homes or even single-family for rent. These are all stories that are just starting to play out. We don't have enough data around it. We will over time. But with that said, we don't know the permanence, how long-lasting it's going to be, and we want to moderate with that, but there a myriad of stories. And maybe Jon and Rick will chime in and share some of their thoughts.
Jon Jaffe: I would add that I think we're seeing more people move out of apartments into new homes versus existing homes. So I think it makes sense to me that, on the multi-family side, they are not seeing a rapid spike in their turnover. But it doesn't take many basis points of market shift from existing to new to really impact the demand for us, and I think we're definitely seeing that because in all our divisions, as Stuart noted, with Southeast Florida, we're seeing a pickup in sales of people coming directly out of apartments.
Rick Beckwitt: And Ivy, one other point, and you've seen it in how you're tracking the better run in higher Class A REITs, is in our multi-family business, our occupancy really hasn't changed much. We have people paying rent and really didn't have a big dip in any of that. And what we've seen as we've really drilled down is it's coming from the non-Class A lower-quality apartments, or people don't want to live there anymore. In the higher Class A that have good amenities, there's people that want to live there. But we're seeing a mass exodus from the lower-quality non-amenitized apartments across the U.S.
Ivy Zelman: And from the perspective of affordability, as builders are right now taking advantage of the strength, they're raising prices and mortgage rates have obviously ticked considerably lower compared to last year, but is there a level that concerns you that that favorable affordability for those Class B tenants that might be driving this exodus -- what does it do to rents and what is it going to do to demand if homebuilders keep pushing price? And thank you, guys. I'm done.
Rick Beckwitt: I think we're just going to have to monitor how things change in the economy. We're seeing a lot of double -- dual income folks coming to our communities where with mortgage rates as low as they are, small price changes, even incremental within a couple of months, really don't move the needle that much. But it's an interesting phenomenon right now.
Stuart Miller: Yes. I think an additional point is, we're going to have to see how employment data starts to shake out; when we think about long term, how the market is actually going to be receptive to the way -- to the migrations that are out there. It seems and feels that employment is going to snap back to some extent. It's not going to be back at 3.5%. There are going to be some disruptions out there, but at the same time, there are a number of people who are finding that they have affordability. And remember, one of the most difficult things to accumulate is the down payments. And with people having stayed at home for so long, not having restaurants and movie theaters and other activities open, the ability to save has actually increased the amount of deposit money available to customers. So all of these things are working together. We'll see how they play out over time. It's part of the reason that we've conservatized some of our numbers because we recognize that we're going to have to wait and see on some of these items. So, next question?
Operator: Next, we have Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Truman Patterson: Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for all the detail. Really appreciate it. Let me also throw on great results. So, following up on Ivy's question, one of the big questions in the market clearly is how sustainable the demand is and whether this rebound is being driven by that pent-up demand potentially, which could trail off. So a couple of questions that I'm hoping you can give us a little bit of color on. One, what portion of your sales today are being driven by, we'll call it, pre-COVID traffic from the first half of March and before? And then, the second part, for sustainability, any idea of what portion of your entry-level purchasers are using government stimulus checks as down payments? A family of four essentially just got a $3,400 check from the government, which can usually go a long way toward a down payment. Any idea or any way you can help us with either of those questions, I'd appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Jon, Rick?
Jon Jaffe: I think with respect to your last question, Truman, as you think about qualification requirements to purchase a home, the people that we're seeing buying our homes today for the most part are not relying on the government assistance checks. They are employed for someone to purchase and close. They we've got job security. So, we're really not seeing that. Stuart said a moment ago, it's -- we really -- and Rick said, we really have to wait and see how things unfold with how sustainable some of these trends are and how much of it is a pullback from what was missed in second half of March and beginning of April, which was in the middle of a very strong spring selling season. How much of these are trends of a strengthening of the millennials moving to the suburbs, people looking for a better way to have a home office, all the factors that we know are playing out right now, we're going to have to see how sustainable they are.
Stuart Miller: I would just add to that, Jon, and say let's remember that what was disrupted by the pandemic was an already very strong housing market, and we were just entering the selling season in a market that was already revealing itself as being fairly robust. When we announced our first quarter earnings, while it took a backseat to the discussion about what was happening to the broader economy, our earnings picture was very strong, our sales were very strong. And so, it makes sense that with a basically two to three-month hiatus or slowdown in the middle, the traffic that was already embedded is somewhat coming forward, but it's added to by the number of narratives that are playing out at the same time. Deciphering which is which is a little bit complicated. And the other thing I want to highlight and remind people is, we have talked for the past years about a production deficit. We have been underproducing homes dwellings from multi-family, rental, all the way through to single-family, suburban. Across the board, the country has been underproducing homes for a very long time, for certainly the past 10 years. And that underproduction means we have short supply against strong demand, pent-up demand, stalled demand, and this is likely to be with us for some period of time. We do not have an overstated inventory to absorb that demand. So we're likely to see an under-supply meeting with a strong demand for some period of time.
Truman Patterson: Okay, thank you for that. If I could just parse the data a little bit further, really kind of micro near-term trends, what was the back half of May's year-over-year growth rate? And with June trending up over 20% year-over-year, could you maybe discuss the gross order improvement? Is this to an extent being driven by a massive decline in the cancellation rate?
Rick Beckwitt: So the cancellation rate really has come down, as I highlighted. And we also pointed out that through the month of May, each week got picked up in activity. So the last week of May was stronger than the first week of May. And then, really going back over the last six weeks, in each of those weeks, we sold north of 1,000 homes, increasing during that time period. So we did see the market solidify. That continued into June. And the market has got a good solid footing right now.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Is there any way to parse out the back half of May's growth rate and that can rate versus how June's can rate is trending?
Rick Beckwitt: We really haven't talked about June can rate, but that has come down. And I just want to be very careful to not give too many micro statistics associated with the business. The trend line was consistent throughout the month, increasing week-to-week and continuing into June.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you, all.
Stuart Miller: Next question? And we'll probably cut it at that point. Two more questions. Okay, go ahead.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks very much guys, and appreciate all the detail and the thoughtfulness in your remarks. The first thing, I just wanted to circle back, for my first question, on the order guidance. And you kind of talked about, Stuart, that there is an element of conservatism here, which is understandable, as well as concern -- not concern, but a trajectory around community count being impacted by some of the land spend and other constraints out there. Hoping to get a sense for what you're thinking about in particular with regards to community count, trying to decouple those drivers and get a sense for how you're thinking of the community count trajectory that ended quarter at 1,245, where that could be by year-end. And from that, is there kind of a margin of error that you're injecting? From a conservative standpoint, are you kind of taking a 10% haircut, let's say, if there is any type of quantification of what that conservatism might be?
Stuart Miller: Well, before I let Rick answer that question, let me just say that community count, we have all learned together, is one of the most difficult numbers to project. It moves around a lot. And in the context of the environment that we've been working in with municipality offices shutting down, being less available, getting fewer of permits out of them for land development, it becomes even more difficult. So I'll let Rick take it from there.
Rick Beckwitt: So, I'll take the question that we really don't know the great answer to, which is, we expect our community count to dip slightly in Q3, stabilize in Q4, and we're optimistic as we enter 2021, through the balance of 2021 that we'll see probably a 5% increase in community count in 2021. Just really can't underestimate the -- the difficulty it has been getting communities out of the ground as towns and municipalities reopen up and do permitting.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. Appreciate that. And I assume you mean -- when you say dip slightly, you mean from 2Q levels. The second question I had was also just kind of circling back to the various initiatives that you've had in place for quite some time around efficiency measures, both on the construction side and on the SG&A, and recognizing that there are probably dozens of initiatives on both of those line items, maybe a little hard to quantify, but I was hoping for any type of thought around what this means over the next couple of years from a margin benefit standpoint, both on the growth side with the various construction initiatives that you've done, as well as the SG&A cost reducing efforts. If there's any way to kind of think about this, or some type of guidance that may be not a formal guidance but just directional guidance, how we should think about, all else equal obviously, what this means for those metrics, the growth side and the SG&A side?
Stuart Miller: So, look Mike, we have daylighted that our focus has been on all ranges of technology across our platform because there is a direct translation to bringing the cost side of our world down. It's everything from construction costs to labor costs, to internal efficiencies and the way that we internally transmit and report our numbers, and all the way through to our customer experience and the way that we interact with our customers. A part of our initiative is designed to make sure that we're able to produce affordable housing. So it's not going to all flow through to margin. It's going to help us keep our home prices affordable as we go forward. And so, there's not a direct relationship to our margin because some of these initiatives are going to flow through to the benefit of our customers. But with that said, we think that our margins will improve. You're already seeing some of that improvement injected going forward. Some of that derives from things like pricing power. Some of it derives from things like reduced incentives or reduced realtor cooperation. But it's -- all parts of our business are bringing our cost structure down. With that said, and to directly answer your question, we look over the next couple of years at the 100 basis points, maybe a couple of hundred basis points that flow through. And these are our objectives. As we think about it, it's more of an internal number than part of our guidance right now. But you're definitely seeing improvement in the way that our cost structure is configured.
Michael Rehaut: Great, thank you.
Stuart Miller: You're welcome. Last question.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question is from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Michael Dahl: All right. Thanks for squeezing me in. Stuart, actually just a couple of follow-ups on some of the internal initiatives, I guess specifically, first on the virtual sales shift, and in addition to an enhanced customer experience, it sounds like some nice financial benefits. But within those comments around the margin, can you help us understand what percentage or any metrics around what portion of your sales force has effectively shifted to more of the virtual new home coordinators versus in-community salespeople?
Stuart Miller: The shift today has been fairly mild. People are still learning to properly use and engage the digital technologies, and that learning curve, it takes some time to implement and to perfect. But as we perfect that, we're going to see a greater number of both our customers enjoying the digital engagement and the autonomy, as well as our new home consultants and what we call our Internet new home consultants, or ISCs, really being able to work with those tools and be far more effective and efficient. This is a migration that's going to take place over the next quarters and years. And I think we'll be better equipped to answer as we develop additional experience. But I will say that the way I think about this is, we've had probably a year or two of change management get incorporated over just the past three months as we've reeducated or educated our new home consultants and our customer base that these tools exist and are quite beneficial to a better experience.
Jon Jaffe: And I would just add that I agree with Stuart, but really 100% of our new home consultants and Internet sales consultants are using our virtual tools today. It's really a question of them becoming experts at it really comfortable with it. We've launched a series of training programs that we take our associates through to how to sell virtually, and it's rapidly accelerating. But it is change management and it will continue to improve.
Michael Dahl: Okay, thanks for that. And then a follow-up for me is then another internal initiatives question just around build cycles. You talked about some of the centralized scheduling. And I was wondering if you could just quantify -- clearly, there are some moving pieces with some of the shutdowns, but maybe at the trough of the issues in March or April, how much had your build cycle widened out or lengthened? And then, do you have any sort of metric you're tracking against with some of these initiatives in terms of how many days you think you can shave off the build cycle by some of these -- with some of these efficiency and digital tools?
Jon Jaffe: What we are seeing is a steady decline as we look year-over-year and sequentially the quarter is a decline in our build cycle time. And so, we've seen -- as an example, this quarter compared to a year ago, about a 15-day decline in our cycle time. So all elements of efficiency from the coordination with our trade, even flow focus, the benefits of everything is included in today's world. I think, just our total Builder of Choice program has attracted trades to us, making sure that we have the trade power that we need on the job as we need them. And we're there to facilitate things flowing more smoothly for them. So, I think that's another trend that I expect to see continue for us as a continued contraction of that.
Stuart Miller: Rick, do you want to weigh in on that?
Rick Beckwitt: Going down.
Stuart Miller: Going down.
Michael Dahl: Great. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: So, I think with that succinct answer, we'll end it there. I want to thank everybody for joining us and for enduring some rather long and windy opening remarks. I know it starts with me, but we felt that we wanted to share more information at what can be a confusing time and look forward to reporting in a more condensed way. Our third quarter is a few months from now. Thank you for joining.
Operator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-03-19 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today’s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Alexandra Lumpkin for the reading of the forward-looking statements.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, everyone, and thank you. This morning, I’m here in Miami and as you can imagine, with a scaled-down crew. Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer and David Collins, our Controller. Bruce Gross, CEO of Lennar Financial Services and of course, Alex, who you just heard are here with me. Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer is in Dallas, and Jon Jaffe, our President is in Irvine, California, and they're on the line with us this morning. We are all properly socially faced. And as much as this is a complicated time to have an earnings call, we're going to alter our traditional format. I'm going to give an overview and Diane will give some brief financial highlights, and then we'll attempt to answer as many of your questions as possible. But as you all consider framing your questions, please remember that the national landscape continues to evolve, and the economy is stretching to find a way to pause in order to flatten the COVID-19 curve. Businesses across the country, like ours, are searching for playbooks and institutional memories to help guide the way forward. Those simply do not exist. There are no financial models to populate and no views around dark corners to illuminate. There is only management, hands-on management, working day-by-day and making adjustments, looking for signals and making decisions in an imperfect environment that will have to be considered and reconsidered as the landscape evolves. This time is different. Change has been sudden studied and the unexpected and immediate, and the changing has not subsided, it continues. So, as many of you know, our company experienced the grief of losing one of our Seattle associates to coronavirus on March 2nd, just after our quarter ended. A successful quarter turned quickly to shock and despair as this was only the third or fourth casualty of COVID-19 in the country. Pete Anderson was known as the big deal in Seattle, because like many of our associates, he was an impact player and positively affected the hearts and minds of his Seattle team, of all of his customers and many of our trade partners as well. Pete participated in all of our Seattle divisions’ focused acts of caring that is Lennar's charitable outreach to community program, while he made our customers tickled, delighted and happy as a customer care representative. Perhaps I've gone too far but I simply had to tell the story to properly respect Pete’s legacy, as well as the brave Lennar Seattle team that proudly supported him, his family and the future of our business. This very sad call to action focused our management's attention on the new day unfolding, even as we mourned the loss of an associate. Our leadership team immediately began to take action to make safety first, as the health and hygiene of our associates, customers and trade partners became our number one priority, while we remained open for business. We flew to the problem not away from it. Our senior management team immediately flew to Seattle, to meet with our team there in order to have a firsthand understanding of the issues and concerns of an affected population. With firsthand experience, we set up a daily call that Rick and John now lead. And I must say parenthetically that there is simply no partnership and leadership that I've ever seen like the one defined by the respect, engagement and camaraderie shared by Rick and John. The strength and durability of this partnership has never been more evident than in this time of turmoil. Their daily meeting includes our regional presidents, our corporate leaders, along with leadership from Lennar Financial Services, Lennar Multifamily, and Dr. Goldschmidt who I mentioned in our press release is now our Chief Medical Officer. On this call, our management team addresses issues and concerns around staying open for business. In a real time setting, the team reviews and implements the plan, the protocols and procedures, to manage our business while we keep our people safe in this very fluid environment. This daily management meeting is where we implement everything from quarantine protocols, to daily wellness checking for 100% of our associates and from pausing land purchases, adjusting start pace and to creating new closing programs and procedures. Our management team is rigorously evaluating every aspect of the business on a daily basis and making the necessary adjustments to ensure that we're on the best and of course safest course as possible. With safety first, we still have an essential business to run. People are still buying homes. People are still closing on homes. And Lennar is still building homes. Let me give you some detail. Even in the current environment, we are selling homes. Our customers are attracted to the safety and security of a home of their own, while interest rates are low and inventory is limited. Although, fears of the general economic slowdown, stock market signals and of course unemployment concerns, may well come to bear. What we have seen so far since the end of the first quarter is that new orders have continued to be strong. For the first two weeks, new orders were up 16%, exceeding plan in each of our operating regions and traffic in our Welcome Home Centers has remained relatively strong. Nevertheless, we have started to see a slowdown in traffic over the past several days, while at the same time we have seen a higher conversion rate of traffic to sales as those coming out are now more serious buyers. As the economy slows, we expected our traffic will decline and we will see the corresponding slowdown in sales. We've moved to an appointment only environment in most of our Welcome Home Centers and in all of our communities we tour only one family at a time to prioritize the safety of our associates and of our customers. Just as we are selling homes, we are also delivering or closing homes. Our customers need and want their new home now more than ever, whether to live comfortably during an economic pause or to work comfortably from home, to-date our customers have wanted to proceed to closing. We have not yet seen an increase in cancellation nor an impact on closing since the end of the quarter. We are working very closely with local municipalities to make sure that we can attain COs and continue to close homes. With an increased focus on health and safety of both our associates and our customers, we have increased the number of digital closing and created an express drive thru closing program where our customers can close their home from their car. We are also implementing a virtual new home orientation process so our homebuyers can walk and review their completed home via FaceTime. In a changing environment, we are accelerating our digital platform to accommodate our customers' desires to close on their home, but to close without risk or contact. While we're selling and closing homes, we're also continuing to build homes. Our construction sites continue to be active and fully functional to-date. We have not yet seen an impact on our trades or on our supply chain. We're very focused on the health and safety of our trades and have established clear protocols with this in mind. We have been in constant communication with our trade partners to help them implement their own safety standard and understand the steps we are taking. We also benefit from the fact that most of our construction activities are in open air environments with appropriate spacing. We’ve begun using FaceTime and other technology to help facilitate inspections and we suspended all non-emergency customer care to protect our associates, our customers and our trade partners. Although, our business has not shut down, we are keenly aware that this landscape can change very quickly. We are focused on bringing money in the door, while limiting money going out the door and focusing on liquidity. Maintaining and innovating our sales construction and closing operations in this environment is critical to cash coming in. To support these functions, we've accelerated various technology initiatives to accommodate our safety first mandate and to bring confidence in troubling times. Likewise, controlling our spend in uncertain times is critical to maximizing our cash position. Land acquisition, land development and home starts, are our three biggest areas of focus. On land acquisition, we are working with land sellers to understand that since the overall economy has paused, we all need to pause as well. In that regard, we are working collaboratively with our strong relationships with national, regional and local developers to activate a circuit breaker, pausing by extending the closing date of our land purchases. This benefits us all. We've also slowed down the amount of cash we are investing in land development, and rephasing our developments to reduce the number of home sites developed at one time. Finally, we're also adjusting our start pace and further limiting the amount of spec inventory production in order to closely match new starts with new sales. While we are with safety first selling, closing and building homes and managing cash flow, we are also supporting our community. I am proud to be a homebuilder and have never been prouder than yesterday when our leading builders of America Association initiated an industry wide plan to find surgical masks and eye protection used in the industry in order to support our hospitals and health providers that are in great need of supplies. The entire industry jumped right in and got to work to show the countries that are homebuilders care, and that we can do well by doing good. I'm very proud to be partners with all of my competitors as we seek to contribute in this time of great news. So in conclusion, let me say, Lennar's first quarter results were excellent and exceeded guidance and expectations on all metrics. That is our first quarter result in a nutshell. But beyond the first quarter, as change and crisis have begun to alter the broader economic foundation, our management team has been connected top to bottom on daily calls to adjust the way our business operates. Most importantly, those first quarter results reflect the work of a very talented and hands on management team that carefully managers our business on a day-to-day basis. We have faced adversity before and although this time it is different, we have adopted and adjusted to meet the moment and to execute. I hope you have heard that the health and safety of our associates, customers and trade partners is and will continue to be our absolute number one priority, people matter. With every day that is passed, we've been focused on what is the right next step to keep everyone safe, while we remain open for business. With each passing week, we have learned and evolved our work environment to match the way we work within the expectations of our associates. This week, for example, with a focus on social distancing, we've developed a program to allow as many of our associates to work from home as possible. While this is new and we are just beginning, we feel confident that with daily focus, we can adjust, learn, evolve and manage all aspects of our business within the boundaries of this program. We're very proud of the quick actions that we've taken to carefully manage our business through these difficult times. We want to thank in conclusion, all of our associates for their tireless efforts, their focus and their dedication. We also want to thank our trade partners, who have worked collaboratively with us to ensure not only a safe healthy home but a quality home. And finally, we want to thank our customers for understanding that we're working hard to adjust many procedures and protocols to safely deliver the new home of their dreams. So with that, let me turn over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning to everyone. So I'd like to spend just a few minutes reviewing the highlights from our first quarter. So for many decades, we have operated with a balance sheet first philosophy and a strong focus on liquidity. And given today's uncertain environments, this is a very good place to start. As noted in our release, we ended the quarter with $785 million of cash on the balance sheet and $2.1 billion of additional availability under our revolving credit facility.  We reduced our year supply of inventory owned to 4.0 as a result of our continued focus on cash flow generation. At quarter-end, our stockholders’ equity increased to 16 billion and our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio was 33.6%, down from 38.5% in the prior year. As we look at the balance of the year, we have a very manageable level of debt maturity with only $300 million due in May, and only $300 million due in November. So with those balance sheet highlights, let me now briefly review our operating performance, starting with homebuilding. New orders increased 18% from the prior year and deliveries increased 17% from the same period. We ended the quarter with 1,258 active communities. Our first quarter gross margin was 20.5%, up 40 basis points from the prior year and our SG&A was 9.2%, which is the lowest first quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved. These core results are evidence that we are managing our homebuilding business extremely well. And our financial services team also executed at high levels. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $41 million from $15 million in the prior year to continue with our technology focus, which will be valuable as we manage forward. Title operating earnings were $10 million, net of non-controlling interest compared to $5 million in the prior year. LMF Commercial, formerly our Rialto Mortgage Finance business, produced operating earnings of $7 million compared to about breakeven in the prior year. And just to spend a minute on our tax rate, the tax rate for the quarter was 7.5% as a result of our tax team’s tremendous effort to obtain the benefits from the new energy efficient home credit extension passed by Congress in December 2019. So in summary, our first quarter results demonstrate that we have a high quality management team that focuses on strategy and execution, which results in exceeding expectations. And so to come back to where I started, today, we find ourselves in turbulent waters and we will do what we always do. We will manage our cash inflows and cash outflows with great focus to ensure we maintain our strong liquidity position and preserve the strength of our balance sheet. And so with those brief comments, let me turn it over to the operator so that we can respond to your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. 
Ivy Zelman: First, I just want to say thank you, Stuart, for your calming and steady rational voice in this crisis, and to commend all the management team for all the steps that you're seeking for keeping your employees safe and all the protocols you've implemented. I know it's really rough sailing out there, but you guys are the best and we want to obviously hear everything you have to say. So let me start with a question about what we've seen in the equity markets just a complete collapse of the values of the companies and your stock and there was trading half of book, which is worse and close to where it traded if not at below where it traded during the crisis. People are expecting massive impairments, because they don't believe the book. So maybe you can help us first by walking through, let's just make, put a stake in the ground and say this thing is behind us, God willing, by the end of the second quarter and we're going to get back to normal. That was the case. And I will say, making it even a more difficult question for you, but you know me. If you had to shut down completely, you were mandated like Boston, no construction jobs sites are allowed to continue, using that to answer the impairment questions, so a two part question. And then I’ll let others ask, because I know that's a lot. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: So first, I want to say, Ivy, we know that that was a compound question so that counts as the question and the follow up [Multiple Speakers]. Well, that's an important and serious question. First as it relates to impairment, I've emphasized in my opening comments that this time it is different. This is not a financially, or financial sector driven slow down, this is not derived from inventory build up, it doesn’t derived from overproduction mortgages or excesses, it is a true Black Swan. It comes from a very different part of the world. So we're going to have to wait to see how this resolves and moves forward. But the impairment question is really relates to what kinds of duration we have and to what extent we see real impact to the overall and broad economy or to what extent we see snapbacks. You have to remember that when you start to look at impairing assets, there's a built in kind of shock absorber, or buffer between a reduction in the market and impairment and that is our gross margin. As you know, our gross margin has been robust and remained strong. You're also looking at inventory levels across the industry that have been defined by short supply and production deficit. And so it's going to be some time before we were called on to raise the question of impairment but with that said, it's possible. But the other counterbalancing thought is to keep in mind that we started a number of years ago, a soft pivot to lighter and shorter duration land position. And those shorter duration land positions will certainly not suffer the kind of impairments that we've seen in prior cycles. Our balance sheet is in excellent stead with shorter land position, strong margin and a short supply of products in the market for a population that has a great affection for having a home that's defined by safety and security for the family. So I think it's premature to start thinking in terms of balance sheet impairments and asset impairment. But I think as we look forward and think that there could be that question, I think it's going to be muted relative to anything we’ve seen in the past. So that's number one…
Ivy Zelman: The shock absorber, though, you mentioned is it, how far did gross margins have to fall? I think that'd be helpful if you could quantify. Is it 10% on gross margin before you have an impairment test?
Stuart Miller: You probably have to see 50% or greater reduction in gross margin to start even thinking about impairment. So really as long as we are generally positive and generally cash flow positive, and Diane gave rather magnificent impairment primer as we went through the last downturn. So, Diane, perhaps you'd like to talk…
Diane Bessette: I think about it again higher level, I mean, if you think about where our gross margins are, let's say, that's about 21% and the impairment process considers selling and marketing expenses. So it's around 6%. So you're already with a 15% net margin as your starting point. So that's reasonably healthy, higher than the net margin that we had around that 2006 timeframe, give or take. So there's no crystal ball, it's very early. But I do think that that higher bar is very helpful to us.
Stuart Miller: So the second part of your question was a shutdown for a month, two month period, and we in no way discount the possibilities as we look around the corner right now. So let me say that we've been very quick to react. And as I noted in the opening remarks, we absolutely have our fingers on all the levers relative to cash going out. If we are shutdown and cash stops coming in, we will immediately be regulating as well the other side of that equation and hope I've highlighted well, but we are focusing on a people first, people safety approach. And that means that while we would regulate the outflow of capital relative to land acquisition, land development and new starts, the very last thing that we would be considering will be laying-off or thinking about reducing our labor force. We are dedicated to supporting our people. We've made this very clear through the organization. And so we think that's our most valuable asset right now. But I think that we can balance the inflows and outflows of capital by managing carefully land, land development and production and maintain our organization in a constructive and healthy way.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Kim, Evercore ISI.
Stephen Kim: Stuart, I definitely agree and glad to hear you say the emphasis is on people first, I think that's absolutely right. I want to ask you about the bigger picture. As we look at -- as we're heading into this downturn, you can't help but think back to the previous downturns. And in past downturns, we saw that some builders chose to, “toe the line on price” and they ultimately suffered for that as they were left with too much land in an even worse market environment later. But to your credit discounted your homes and built out your communities as quickly as possible in order to work down your landholding. But as you said, this time seems a bit different and it sounds like now you're looking to moderate production to keep it in line with demand. And so my question, kind of a two part question is, one, does this mean that if demand flows sharply in the near-term, you think it won't be as price elastic as in the past and therefore, that you would be slower to discount your home's than in the past? And then secondarily, if so, how exactly would you do that? Would it still be left up to the discretion of the DPs of division president, or would corporate being more involved? And how long would you be willing to maintain that kind of a posture?
Stuart Miller: So Stephen, I really like your question, because it highlights the statement that I made a number of times, and that it is very, very different this time. And in a traditional economic slowdown, economy driven slow down, accelerating production, there is a price discovery mechanism. The question here is to what extent are markets going to be paused for a period of time and we'll even be able to keep our construction sites moving forward. So, the landscape is shifting and changing on a daily basis. The answer to your question is embedded in my statement that it's all about management, it's all about hands on management and adjusting to the landscape day-by-day as it unfolds. So the answer to your direct question is going to be we'll see. Let's see what the components are that defines a slow down, the reduction in sales, let’s see if buyers are out there if they have appetite. Right now, pricing isn't really big issue, because we all know that our customers don't buy price, they buy monthly payment. And with interest rates low, the ability to purchase at a price, their pricing is good. The question is do they have the capacity, do they feel uncomfortable with unemployment possibilities, where is the economy going, how is it rebuilding. We're going to have to wait and see. Navigating the waters is going to be a day-by-day process, and that's exactly what we're doing. It's an everyday focus. And I will just ask, Rick, John, would you like to chime in on this?
Jon Jaffe: What we're seeing is exactly what you described is price is not the issue right now. PITI is actually in most of our markets less than monthly rents, but very attractive for those that are out there shopping for a new home. So we're going to have to really react as we see things change on a daily basis. And what we're already seeing is it's different market by market, and even within that, I think you'll see fluctuations. So we're going to adjust as we go.
Rick Beckwitt: And I don't think you can underestimate Stuart's comment about the safety of having your own home. We're seeing that much of the customers coming in they want a place where they can stay. And that combined with the low rate environments and limited inventory that's continuing to drive the opportunity set.
Stephen Kim: Well, that's very encouraging, obviously. And it was also encouraging, Stuart, that you indicated that you really haven't seen a slowdown in the traffic, or not meaningful increase in cancellations, I should say and that the slowdown in traffic was actually met with an increase in conversion rate. The one question that I had, the second question I have for you, which is shorter is, basically if you're making any marketing changes or see any opportunity to make marketing changes using your strong online presence. If you're finding that customers or anticipating the customers will be more willing to go further in the shopping experience online. And if that might actually result in some unintended benefits, such as just to pick one, maybe a reduction in co-broker commissions, let's say, or maybe some other benefits from your investments you've been doing online?
Stuart Miller: So, I hate at this time to be talking about unintended benefits. But the answer is, we have a focused team approach right now on looking at our digital and technology oriented initiatives and counting them together. We basically have three focused strands that are customer facing. One of them is lead production through digital contracting, the entire process of generating lead, scoring a lead, attributing leads, engaging our customers in a digital format through internet, new home consultants and bringing a digital representation of our home. The entire process of engaging our customers on a digital platform is something that we are accelerating. We of course, as you know and I've spoken about in prior earnings calls, it has been a focal point of the company. This is a time where we're leaning into that. And of course, the change management that might have been frictional in the past is less frictional today, because it's just an opportunity to accommodate the market as it exists today. So the answer is a defined, yes. The second strand is in the closing process. We've been focused, we've mentioned before, a one tap solution, all the way from the contract through to the closing from mortgage application to mortgage approval, title, insurance, appraisal, all of the components we've been working on digital platforms versus been tirelessly working soup to nuts on that, the progress that we've been making. This just even focuses our attention even more on getting to that digital platform. And even in the interim, the innovation around a digital closing or a drive by closing, which is an innovation on the fly of engaging the notarization process and the papers that need to be signed right from the comfort of someone's car, not having to come into the office is an accommodation to the market that exists today. And Bruce and our financial services group have been working on that, and then of course relative to warranty. We are working on a more robust zero-defect closing, necessitating much less warranty engagement, which is not desired today. Touch points are not desired and engaging our relationship with some of our digital partners to rethink our warranty program. But these strands in our digital platform have given us a head start and are enabling us to think differently about how we manage our business through a very quickly changing environment.
Operator: Our next question is from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne: And first of all, let me start with condolences to your team and Lennar family. I had heard about Pete’s loss while on the field last week, and so I just want to pass that along. And we're all thinking of you and hope you all stay safe and well. First of all, let me just clarify one thing. Are there any communities out there that are under and operational shutdown due to shelter in place ordinances or anything that close to you shutting down operationally?
Jon Jaffe: There's just three or four small municipalities at this point that are impacted a couple small ones in Philadelphia area, Newark and Gilroy out here in California. But for the most part, even when there's been shelter in place ordinances construction has been viewed as essential and business continues.
Buck Horne: And when we're thinking about turning back on the land acquisition development spending to build the cash flow. Have you taken any initial drags as kind of how much you trimmed budget for this year, or is it just kind of still all very much influx at this point? Or how quickly could, I guess the cash outflow from land purchases or developments be trimmed back in a situation like this?
Stuart Miller: Rick, you're leading that?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, I'll tell you, we are very focused on cash going out the door. We started the process immediately when this whole situation came up. And it's really a weekly focus on each land transaction, wire going out and of course, my approval, Jon's approval Stuart's approval. And so we've taken a look at the timeline of all of our deals, all of our deposits and we've engaged in dialog with the close relationships that we've got going out several, several months. And at some point, this will come to a pass. We're not walking away from these opportunities, we're really as Stuart said, looking to postpone the closing and we're working hand in hand with the development community.
Stuart Miller: Let me add to that, Rick and say, because what we've talked about is, this is a legitimate circuit breaker. Right now, the market has shifted rather abruptly. I think we all recognize that. This is a circuit breaker that enables the world, the market and ourselves, to recalibrate just a little bit to take a breath and that's how we're talking to our land partners and that's how we view them. They might be selling and we might be adverse at the negotiating table. But right now, it's all about how are we going to migrate forward. The economy is taking pause and so to do the land deals have to take a pause, and we're working with most of them, it won't be all of them but most of them. To put a pause in place and enable the market to reset and that's the way to think about it right now. But it materially alters the outflow of capital as we prepare for a stabilized balance sheet and foundation to navigate forward.
Diane Bessette: And I think, Buck, the only other thing that I would add is, if it wasn't clear. Land development is in the same category, those dollars are equally large. And so we had looked at every single community every single dollar be spent in that community with the same level of rigor.
Operator: And our next question is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: I also want to extend my condolences to the Lennar team and your associate, Pete, in Seattle, very sad to hear that, and commend everyone on all of the thoughtful approach that you've described, particularly in terms of safety and health, since that point, or perhaps that had started before that point. But the first question I had what kind of harkens back a little bit to an earlier question around just the current market backdrop amid a pause and again, kind of recognizing how different and how different the drivers are of the current economic backdrop and perhaps what's to come over the next quarter or two relative to the great financial crisis, and that you don't have the same type of drivers to the destruction of demand, from either a mortgage market standpoint and excess inventory standpoint. I'm curious if you've had comments as it relates, with your other homebuilding peers, you alluded to the fact before some of the efforts by the industry association around some of the surgical supplies, but from a market standpoint, to the extent that you just have a pause not because of demand, but because of public safety and other factors. Obviously, you talked about home prices being pretty reasonable at this point, particularly coming off of the affordability crunch 18 months ago. I'm curious if you've talked to any of your other home buildings here around, in effect holding the line for a quarter or two, not making any rash decisions, particularly given the fact that I think cash flows are also very different this time around.
Stuart Miller: So let me say, Mike, one of the things we don't ever do is, have coordinated efforts relative to pricing or any of the operational side. We compete head-to-head and we’re competitors. But I do want to say in that light that I am a proud partner with our competitors in the jump to action across the industry, to think about how we can participate in fortifying supplies, both surgical masks, as you know, you've been painting and other parts of our business, as well as eye protection to help our health services. So while I have to say most emphatically that we're not having the discussions around pricing or holding the line, I'm not even sure that it would be appropriate to do that. We are definitely coordinated with our competitors as partners in serving our community and serving the greater good at homebuilders really care.
Michael Rehaut: And I guess my question was, I didn't mean to imply any type of coordination of price more just, I guess, for me, an informal approach but I understand your response.
Stuart Miller: Let me say that that our competitive field is a group of very smart, capable, professional home builders. They're going to each and we're going to each, make decisions day by day running our businesses quite independently. And we're all seeing the same data points in the market. I think that intelligent decisions will be made across the industry.
Michael Rehaut: I guess, secondly, coming off of your comments around cash management, which is obviously critical here in the next quarter or two and hopefully, it isn't as necessary perhaps as we get into the back half of the year, things hopefully normalize. But you've talked about community-by-community monitoring spend on land, span land development, et cetera. I was hopeful to get a sense of maybe before this started what, if you could remind us what your plans were from a land spend and land development standpoint in terms of the dollars that you are expecting as part of your former guidance. And to the extent that things go to a hard stop. How much of that could be pulled back? And separately, also again in this in this light of cash out the door, if there are elements of the corporate G&A line and SG&A line that combines right now around 10%. What parts of those line items could also be pulled back to the extent that business does go into to a halt for a period of time?
Stuart Miller: So as it relates to land, you'll remember that our base strategy has been, had been, continues to be, migrating to a higher percentage of option, lower percentage of owned land. We had been migrating to a materially smaller spend relative to land and our cash flows were starting to demonstrate that. Of course, we're continuing along those lines. And so before these change in circumstance, we were on path to a materially lighter land position and expect to continue that trajectory. As it relates to SG&A, as I said, its people first right now, so let's not even think about the people side of the business, because we're here to support our people and they've been out there supporting us. But on the SG&A side, there are marketing costs and other costs that of course we are managing and monitoring. You've been watching our SG&A migrate downward anyway as an organic part of our business model that will be something that we continue to focus on. I basically say to you to focus on the fact that this was a management team that has its fingers and hands on all levers. And as markets defined themselves, we will be defining both the spend, liquidity and SG&A, and managing in concert with market conditions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.
Carl Reichardt: And hope you're all safe and healthy there in your scattered locations. I have a question for Bruce, if he's in there. I just wanted to get sort of a real broad sketch of how you're looking at the mortgage market. Now Bruce, obviously and MBS investors worried about prepayments, rates have been all over the place, banks are snowed under with refi demand. I just want to see how the mortgage market in your view is functioning right now, and how your customers are reacting to the bounce around the rates?
Bruce Gross: So with respect to the mortgage market, we have not seen disruption thus far. The fed stepping in and backing MBS market this week, has offered quite a bit of support. If you think about where we sell our loans to, about 70% of them are sold to the GSEs. So to the extent any of the investors in that subset were to become weaker, we could increase the percentage to the GSE. So it's functioning really well. On top of that, the GSE's have been great partners through this. They're looking at things, such as verifications of employment, which people have been asking about. And where typically you have to get a verbal approval, they’re looking at accepting e-mails in this environment, instead of verbal verifications. Appraisals, they're looking at desktops and drive wise that would be helpful as well. So they're working to eliminate friction points. So we're pleased with the fact that it's operating somewhat normal thus far. People are trying to be anticipatory, as far as what to be friction points and they are dealing with those one at a time. With respect to us, Stuart mentioned full digital closings are really helping. So the fact that we focused on technology early, really help. So we went to our banks and we got approval for electronic notes to be sold through the banking system, which allows for a full digital closing for us, that's already approved. So when we have somebody that's working remotely with a remote online notary from the comfort of their home, they could go ahead and electronically sign the documents, work with this remote notary, go through our system digitally, have the e-mails transferred, so there's no human contact. So I think the fact that Stuart focused us all on technology early and the financial service team has been working hard at this gave us a head start and puts us in a good position to take advantage of these technologies, and the GSE is at partners. So we feel like this is working more normal than certainly people are expecting at this point.
Carl Reichardt: And then, Stuart, just a follow up on a couple of questions, about residential construction being deemed and it’s been essential service in some of the shutdown and shelter in place orders. Are you, in your conversations with the other builders, with NAHB, with BIAs or with governmental entities? Are you getting a sense that as this rolls out that the Bay Area model, which exempted residential construction, is going to be the go forward model? Do you have any sense of that at this point?
Stuart Miller: The landscape is still defining itself and it's too early to tell. We have a general sense that that is more the case. Jon, maybe you'd like to weigh in on that.
Jon Jaffe: It's somewhat of a marquee landscape right now, each city is acting independently. We found that there is actually, as you noted in your question, a coordinated effort through the building industry associations working with each municipalities to get clarity. All I can tell you is what we found to-date is when we have the opportunity to have that audience and have the discussion, the cities are clarifying that the construction can continue reporting offices for title, transfers can continue. But there's no coordinated effort between municipalities at this point, this is all on a one off basis. So we're just going to have to monitor.
Stuart Miller: Rick, you have any different perspective?
Rick Beckwitt: No, that's just spot on. I think that what's happening is you're seeing an increasing use of some of the newer technologies utilized by the municipalities and doing inspections and doing appraisals and keeping their businesses open. They're very focused on not shutting down housing but we're going to have to see how this morphs over the next several that weeks… 
Jon Jaffe: So, let me just add on in real time. Nevada put out an order that there was confusion about just this morning, they clarified that construction is exempt. So construction will continue in Nevada, which affects Las Vegas and Reno, obviously, but that's just a good example how one off of the building industry goes and meets with the offices in this case with the governor's office, because this was a statewide order and we ended up with, just for the time being, the resolution that construction will continue in Nevada.
Operator: Our next question is from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo.
Truman Patterson: Hi, good morning, everyone. Sorry to hear about Pete, and I hope the rest of you are healthy and safe. First question just a clarification, Diane, following up on Ivy's question. You were talking about the impairment process and you said 21% gross margins, 6% selling costs. So I believe you are implying that really kind of a 15% decline in gross margin is really necessary for impairments. Is that clear, or is that correct?
Diane Bessette: Directionally, that's right. Those are the components and that's where the bar is right now, so that's the starting point, because we’re only considering the selling and marketing, not the division G&A. It's always the costs that are directly associated with the land, so that's directionally correct.
Stuart Miller: But let me just also say because Diane raises points to me the other day, and that is. Even as you think of impairments and getting to that place, the duration of land that we have sitting on our books is so much less than we ever saw before. The biggest impacts are to your later dated land. And, as you go through the impairment model, that's where the big impact is. So even if you've got to that point, the impact would be significantly less.
Diane Bessette: Yes, I was going to punctuate that as well. That's right. So even if you got there, the amount of land that you're applying that too is far less, so your numbers will be lower.
Truman Patterson: Okay, thank you for that clarification. Actually, Stuart, you actually touched on kind of my main question, on the land impairments. Clearly, investors are very worried about this and a potential recession. But could you maybe discuss, you again already touched on this, but how your business model has changed versus the 2006 crash, thinking JVs, your land structure, because I believe you all were a bit more, one of the more, one of the more aggressive to write off your land in ’06 crash. And then also, Stuart, your company's been around for 65 years any period in history where you've seen material land impairments, outside of the great housing recession?
Stuart Miller: So let me say that in the last downturn, if you dissect the way that we approach the financial down turn, what we think of is end of ’05, ’06, ’07, 0’8, ‘09 those years, we adjusted first our home prices very quickly as we saw the market start to deteriorate. And we started selling homes at lower prices and looking at price discovery that was our starting point. And of course, the market continued to migrate downwards for an extended period of time, which at a later date translated into land impairments, because the pricing was coming down so quickly. In the current environment, we're not thinking about it this way. To-date, we have a shortage of supply of homes on the market, a shortage of supply of dwelling a production deficit that is still being made up since that downturn, it still hasn't been made up. There's still a need for dwelling. If you go to the discourse at local communities across the country, before the current issues arrived, the discourse was about lack of affordable housing, a shortage of affordable housing and the concerns that were being raised at local levels were how do we get more? We were not in an oversupplied situation. In today's environment, we're looking at a very different program. Right now, we're looking at an economic pause. There's going to be the beginning. There's a beginning. There's going to be an end to this. How we will recover from there is going to be a question. But with that said, I don't think that -- we don't feel that price and financial instigators are going to be at the heart of this. It's going to be more a recalibration. This is not an environment where we're going to build into it and build up inventory and sell at price discovery. What we've already highlighted is we're staying very close to the market. We're looking at on and off switches to see what's available, what we can do, and it's going to be very market-by-market case-by-case specific. And that's why I highlight the value of that the hands-on management team that's meeting every day, market-by-market to look at what's happening to define our way forward. It's very, very different landscape. I don't think we can go backwards in history, either to the last downturn or any of the prior ones. We've not seen one that looks like that. So there really isn't specific history to draw from. We're going to have to create this playbook as we go and I think that we're uniquely positioned to be able to do that.
Truman Patterson: Given that this is a pretty unique situation and you all are focused on managing cash flow. What does that imply near term for share repurchase. And you all mentioned you have $300 million in debt coming due in May and another $300 million in November. Do you plan on paying that down? What do you plan on doing with your dividend? And then also you mentioned adjusting the spec level. Does that mean that you all are going to remain extremely rational with pricing and just work off whatever specs you currently have on hand?
Stuart Miller: As it relates to stock repurchase, we're clearly pausing stock repurchase as we look ahead in today's environment, because there is enough uncertainty where nothing is on autopilot. Nothing in our company is on autopilot. Everything that happens in this company is being considered on a day-by-day basis. As it relates to our debt pay down, the $300 million coming due and then the next $300 million, it is our expectation right now that we will repay those outstanding bonds. And one of the things I would highlight is that we are in the enviable position with an already recast balance sheet and already strong liquidity where we have the ability to meet those opportunities to pay down that debt, which has been our primary focus for some time and to meet that quite comfortably. So that is our thinking right now. That's the way that we're approaching the market. Not stock buybacks. Yes, pay down the debt. And manage the business and liquidity on a day-by-day basis. Everything is being manually engaged, nothing on autopilot.
Operator: Our final question today is from John Lovallo from Bank of America.
John Lovallo: I guess the first question is accessing credit lines pretty challenging when things got tough during the financial crisis and in many cases, as you know, bank lines or banks pulled these lines from companies. Have you considered preemptively drawing on your lines just as an abundance of caution?
Diane Bessette: No, John, that really hasn't been their direction. I think our real focus is just generating cash. That's the better answer. So as you've heard us say throughout this call, it's really managing the cash flows. And it is not our desire or goal to draw down on our lines as has been the talk in today's market.
Stuart Miller: So I think that, look again, we look day-by-day and consider the world as it unfolds, we are in the enviable position of a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. With that said, we don't want to be caught off guard. But as we look at the national environment and what the government is doing right now, it seems that the government is very, very focused on getting ahead of focusing on liquidity in order to support businesses and support individuals as we migrate through the soft spot. So our [inaudible] reaction right now is not to and we don't have to pull down on those lines.
John Lovallo: And then that actually feeds into another question here, with interest rates near zero and the fed seemingly doing a lot and the government willing to pull out all stops here to avoid a recession or even potentially a depression. Stuart, if you could ask the government for one action that you think can help the homebuilding industry, what would that be?
Stuart Miller: I think if I could ask the government for one action, it would be to demonstrate leadership and putting safety, security and health, health and hygiene first and foremost across our landscape, and it's probably a great place to conclude. Across our landscape, we were faced with a tragedy and we ran to the fire and we focused on what's the landscape, what's really happening and how do we address it? How do we put people and safety first and foremost, how do we focus on health and hygiene and how do we operate in a socially connected environment in a way that is pro social and that keeps us all safe. I think that leadership in these circumstances is critically important. It's the tone of our voice. It's the way that we confront and deal with the issues of the day. And I think that our work with our now Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Pascal Goldschmidt, has helped us navigate the circumstances, operate our business, and I think very much keep our people safe while we operate in an appropriate way. I guess I would ask of the government that it shows the same leadership. Just saying, focus on if you're sick, stay home. If you're together, stay six feet apart and let's don't shake hands, let's not even elbow bump. Let's focus on promoting safety, while we navigate the waters of finding a cure and ultimately a vaccine. And so that's what I think would help the homebuilding world and perhaps the rest of the economy heal appropriately. And I would ask for just good, strong, smart, focused leadership. So with that, let's end it there. And let me say thanks for joining us for our first quarter conference call. And we’ll look forward to keeping you apprised of the progress inside our company as we figure out how the landscape is changing and as we run our business and do the best that we can in changing times. Thank you for joining.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you. This morning, I’m here in Miami with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffee, our President; Diane Bessette, Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Collins, our Controller; and of course, you’ve just heard from Alex. I’m going to start, as I always do with a brief overview, Jon and Rick are going to give some additional operational remarks, and Diane will deliver further detail on our fourth quarter and year-end numbers, as well as some guidance for our first quarter and our full-year 2020. As always, when we get to our Q&A, we’d like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that this is another excellent quarter and year-end for the company, as we continue to focus on performance, cash flow, and total shareholder returns. We’re very pleased to report record quarterly performance together with a record strong finish to 2019 that started off paused and sluggish and ended the year with a rather robust housing market. Our results reflect both the continued strength in the housing market, as well as our continued focus on leveraging size and scale to drive greater cash flow and higher returns on equity and on capital. On the macro front, the housing market continued to strengthen throughout the fourth quarter, confirming the continuing trends that we reported in our last two quarterly earnings calls. The market for new homes has continued a steady improvement from last year’s pause, as lower interest rates have stimulated demand, while the overall fundamentals of the economy have remained strong. We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the fourth quarter, as a combination of lower interest rates and slower price appreciation have positively impacted affordability. Greater affordability, together with low unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence, and economic growth drove home purchases, especially at the entry-level to return to a more affordable housing market. Even with the constant noise from the current election cycle and from the ebb and flow of global tensions, which we’re seeing play out in real-time, the indicators that we see and hear from our customers reflect confidence in the stability of the economy and in the job market. As of now and through today, the housing market is strong. On the company front, Lennar achieved record results as we posted net earnings of over $674 million, or $2.13 a share for the quarter, and approximately $1.850 billion or $5.74 per share for the year. These results derived primarily from solid operating results from both homebuilding and Financial Services, as our ancillary businesses have become less of a factor. In homebuilding, improvement in new orders and deliveries produced a gross margin of 21.5% for the quarter, which was at the high-end of our guidance last quarter. While deliveries jumped 16% over last year and new orders improved 23% over last year’s rather tepid fourth quarter, our size and scale in most of the best markets in the country enables us to offset rising land costs with production cost savings, while overhead leverage has driven our SG&A to an all-time fourth quarter low of 7.6% and a full-year low of 8.3%, which has enabled the net margin of 13.9% and 12.3%, respectively. We’re confident that these trends are going to continue into 2020. Our Financial Services performance also continued to contribute to our earnings beat. I want to focus on this segment for a minute as I did last quarter. Our Financial Services performance and improvement continues to be a proxy for many of the important initiatives driving our company into next year and beyond. For the year, Financial – our Financial Services division earned $244 million versus $200 million last year, up 22%. Performance improved though through the year and in the current quarter. Our Financial Services segment generated a record quarterly profit of $81.2 million compared to $57.6 million last year or a 41% improvement. This record profit comes after selling substantially all of the company’s retail operations in both mortgage and title in the first quarter earlier this year. These sales enabled our team to focus on the core homebuying business and to implement technology initiatives that are streamlining the remaining business. This focus on the core business drove significant operational improvement in the second half of the year. First, we increased the company’s combined mortgage capture rate from 78% – to 78% from 74% by focusing on simplifying our customers engagement and providing excellent customer service. Second, we reduced the cost to originate a loan by 11% from $6,300 per loan last year to $6,000 per loan in the third quarter to $5,600 per loan this quarter, steady improvement, and this is down by one-third from $8,400 per loan in 2017. These cost reductions were driven by management’s focused on technology initiatives, which include our blend front-end technology for loan application, along with robotic processes that automate repetitive processes to reduce paper flow and streamline the closing process. These improvements all lead to not only lower cost to the company, but to a friendlier and frictionless customer experience with the company. Finally, we have reduced total Financial Services headcount by about 50% at the same time. Technology, together with management focus, has enabled efficiency, a better customer experience, and a much better bottom line. In our Financial Services division, our management team and the entire group have made technology initiatives a core mission and are showing leadership for the entire company in that regard. Accordingly, we’re gaining ever more confidence that we will continue to improve our entire end-to-end process to get to a one tap closing and create a customer satisfaction process that is simple, frictionless, and has never been seen before. And as we’re building these improvements, we’re also seeing the fruits of our focus in investments at the bottom line. These improvements specifically, and these types of improvements generally are sustainable, and they will continue to drive bottom line improvement in our Financial Services segment and across our entire company in the future. Over the next two years, we expect to see some of the same technology-based improvements affecting our core homebuilding operations, specifically in areas of customer acquisition costs and even flow production and inventory management. Stay tuned. Moving on, while our strong operating results drove the bottom line, we are simultaneously focused on any and all ways to improve total shareholder returns by reducing our asset base. Our fourth quarter results reflect our overall focus on land spend and inventory control that has enhanced our strong and improving cash flow picture as well. We’ve maintained a relentless focus on our pivot to a land lighter strategy. From the timing of land purchases to the duration of each land asset that we buy to the percentage of option versus owned land, we are and will continue migrating towards a significantly smaller land-owned inventory, driving our business and our cash flow forward. While we’re also driving our asset base lower by continuing to focus on monetizing non-core assets and business segments, our most immediately impactful focus remains on our land spend and our inventory. With that said, strong operating results and our focus on asset base has increased cash flow for this year to $1.6 billion and projected annual cash flow expectations for 2020 are continuing to head towards the $2 billion mark. In the fourth quarter, we used excess cash to repay an additional $600 million of debt, while we also repurchased another 1.7 million shares of stock at an average price of just under $59 a share. For the year, we retired $1.1 billion of senior debt, while repurchasing almost 10 million shares of stock, while we ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash and our revolver paid to zero. We improved our balance sheet with a debt to total cap ratio of approximately 33%, which is a 410 basis point improvement over last year. As we look to 2020, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and will use cash to pay down debt and to return capital to shareholders, while improving our balance sheet as we continue to improve our total shareholder returns. In conclusion, let me end where I began. We had another excellent quarter and year-end. Our management team is laser-focused on driving returns with excellent operational execution and careful land and inventory management. This focus is not just demonstrated by our words, but also by last year’s results. While 2019 is in the book, 2020 seems even brighter to us. We remain encouraged by both market conditions for the remainder of the year and Lennar’s position in it. Our size and scale continues to facilitate the management of cost and the production in a land and labor constraints market. In addition to carrying forward the successes of last year, we have the additional opportunities of our growing single-family for rent initiative and our technology-based improvements to the way our customers purchase a home and the way our customers live in a home. These strategies, along with our “sustainable Lennar sub team” will continue to drive operational innovation and excellence and enhance total shareholder return. With that, let me turn it over to the rest of the team. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. We had a strong quarter in each of our business segments, driven by a solid execution of our operating strategies. Homebuilding revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $6.5 billion, representing an 8% increase from 2018. This was driven by a 16% increase in deliveries to 16,420 homes, partially offset by a 7% decrease in average sales price. Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance, as we carefully matched available inventory with strong buyer demand. The decline in average sales price was driven by our continued strategic focus on the very robust entry-level market, as our percentage of first-time buyers increased year-over-year. Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 21.5%, which was the top side of our guidance, and up 110 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. This sequential improvement benefited from the direct cost savings that Jon will discuss, as well as a higher number of deliveries, which allowed us to leverage our field expense. Our SG&A in the quarter was 7.6%. This marks an all-time fourth quarter low and highlights the power of our increased market scale and operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings totaled $893 million, up 11% from the prior year. We’re proud of the fact that our homebuilding earnings are growing at a faster rate than revenues once again, demonstrating our operating leverage. Net earnings for the quarter totaled $674 million, up 11% from 2018, excluding the gain on the sale of Rialto and non-recurring expenses in the prior year. New orders for the quarter increased 23% to 13,089 homes, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. From a dollar value perspective, new orders totaled $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 23% from the prior year as well. New orders increased significantly in each of our operating in our Homebuilding segments, with extremely strong performance from our Texas region and our West region, where new orders were up 48% and 34%, respectively, year-over-year. Our Texas segment is perfectly positioned and continues to benefit from our strategic focus on the strong entry-level market. During the fourth quarter, we saw increased demand, which benefited from favorable housing market fundamentals, low unemployment, higher wages, competitive mortgage rates, low inventory levels, and a much more confident homebuyer, all contributed to a 26% increase in our sales pace per community year-over-year. We ended the fourth quarter with a sales backlog of 15,577 homes, with a dollar value of $6.3 billion. This backlog, combined with our current housing inventory, puts us in a great position to close between 54,000 and 55,000 homes in fiscal 2020. As Stuart said, in fiscal 2019, we were laser-focused on improving our returns on capital and generating increased cash flow. With this in mind, increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing our year supply of owned homesites were top priorities. At the beginning of the year, we set a two-year goal of having 40% of our homesites controlled via options and similar arrangements. We made great progress on this front throughout the year, as we ended the first quarter with a 24% mix, ended the third quarter at 30% and finished the year at 33%. Based on our progress, our new two-year goal is to have 50% of our land needs controlled versus owned by the end of fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter, we also made to get significant progress on reducing our years owned supply of homesites from 4.4 years at the end of the third quarter to 4.1 years at the end of the fourth quarter. Based on this progress, we believe we can reduce our years owned supply of homesites to three years by the end of fiscal 2021 as well. If we’re successful, this would reduce our on-balance sheet land position by approximately $3 billion. The combined impact of properly executing on our land lighter business and reaching our stated owned and controlled goals will drive meaningful higher cash flow, returns on capital and total shareholder returns. Consistent with our land light strategy and focused on increased returns, we’re continuing to develop a program to develop and address the single-family rental market. There’s no question that there’s a shortage of affordable and workforce housing, and new single-family rentals can solve this problem. Given the shortage, there’s intense investor interest in professionally managed new single-family rental communities, where the owner can leverage the overhead costs of managing the rentals, because they are in the same community with identical features from home-to-home. Last quarter, we dilated our single-family rental program, where our homebuilding operation will be building and selling homes in bulk in communities with land is owned by third parties, with no lease-up risk to Lennar. Since then, we’ve expanded this program to include building and selling incremental single-family rentals in bulk in separate sections of some of our larger existing communities. While we’re at the beginning stages of growing this business, we’re excited about its growth prospects. Given the lead time in developing new communities and getting home production started, single-family rentals will only represent about a 1% of our closings in 2020. However, this program will have a much more meaningful impact in 2021, and we will provide an update accordingly. Single-family rental is an expansion of our core business, as it allows us to leverage our existing machine and overhead. Additionally, this program provides an interesting and unique hedge to our for-sale business. Before I turn it over to Jon, I would like to thank our associates and our trade partners for an excellent year. Through your hard work and collaboration, we accomplished many great things in 2019. And more importantly, we’re excellently positioned to execute on our strategy since 2020. I’d like to turn it over to Jon now.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. As we look back on the quarter in our fiscal year, we can clearly see the benefits we are receiving from our significant size and scale across the platform. For both the fourth quarter and for the year, we delivered the most homes in Lennar’s history. We continue to see the benefits in our direct construction costs and in our SG&A that are not only result of this size and scale, but also of our focus on process, particularly the simplification of processes to maximize efficiencies. Turning first to direct construction costs. I noted last quarter, we had visibility that our direct costs are going down sequentially, and will contribute positively to our gross margins going forward. In our fourth quarter, 70 basis points of our 110 basis points of sequential margin improvement came from our direct construction costs. In the fourth quarter, our direct cost as a percentage of our average sales price was 45.5%. Throughout 2019, this cost to price ratio has trended downward each quarter. We expect this trend to continue throughout 2020, even though we’re projecting lower sales prices in 2020 due to a higher mix of entry-level homes. Looking at cost per square foot, year-over-year, our direct costs were up less than 1%, while our average square footage was down by 4%. This is an improvement from the third quarter’s 3% year-over-year increase and marks the lowest rate of year-over-year direct costs increase in 12 quarters. Going forward, as we deliver more entry-level homes and our average selling price and square footage will both continue to be lower. While this is occurring, the ability to both lower our direct construction costs as a percentage of average sales price and to keep our cost per square foot relatively flat, demonstrate the value of the size, scale and efficiency of our platform. Across the country, our builder of choice focus allows Lennar to minimize the impacts of the labor shortage, while maximizing supply chain efficiencies. Throughout 2019, we were disciplined with our even flow production model, which combined with our everything is included platform gives predictability to our trade partners, suppliers and manufacturers. Turning now to overhead. As noted, our fourth quarter and full-year SG&A of 7.6% and 8.3%, respectively, were both all-time company lows. Our focus on simplicity and technology, combined with our size and scale, continue to give us SG&A leverage. As we improve our systems and simplify our processes, our associates increasingly become more efficient. In the fourth quarter, our year-over-year personnel spend in homebuilding SG&A was down 1%, while our volume increased by 16%, giving us significant G&A leverage. We achieved sales and marketing leverage through the use of technology to reduce our sales and marketing spend. As we mentioned last quarter, we are focused on higher-quality Internet leads to our Internet sales team. In the fourth quarter, we had over 90,000 Internet leads, meaning, we had that many customers requesting specific information about a home or community. Our team of Internet sales consultants then communicate with the customer online via text messaging or by phone call to learn more about the customers’ needs and then match their specific needs with our homes and the range and visit to one of our communities. The result is high-quality, very well informed customers, with set times visiting our communities. In summary, we’re executing our game plan with the following unified playbooks: one, simplification, maximizing the efficiency of every process; two, asset light, optioning land and buying land with shorter durations; three, even flow production, operating our everything is included platform with a step production start pace, while matching sales to this page using our dynamic pricing model; four, lower direct construction costs, developing strategic builder of choice partnerships throughout the supply chain, along with value engineering workshops division by division; and five, technology, providing better systems and information for happier more productive associates, a better customer experience and lower costs. Now, I’ll turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning to everyone. So please let me start with reemphasizing a few points from our fourth quarter starting with homebuilding. So as Rick mentioned, deliveries increased 16% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of our guidance by 3%, as we benefited from a strong housing market and a continued focus on returns. Our fourth quarter gross margin was 21.5%, which was at the higher-end of our guidance and the prior year’s gross margin was 22.1% excluding CalAtlantic purchase accounting. Our fourth quarter SG&A was 7.6%, which is the lowest quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved and was below our guidance. This compared to 7.9% in the prior year. New orders increased 23% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of our guidance by 6%. Absorption for the fourth quarter was a 3.4 versus 2.7 in the price year, as we benefited from increased demand and focused on accelerating the closeout of slower-paced communities to enhance returns. Our ending community count was 1,283. And finally, for homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other categories, we had a combined loss of $2 million, compared to $4 million of earnings in the prior year. And then turning to Financial Services. As Stuart mentioned, operating earnings were $81 million, compared to $58 million in the prior year, and here’s the detail of the components. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $57 million from $44 million in the prior year. Mortgage earnings improved due to an increase in capital volume as a result of higher homebuilding deliveries and a higher capture rate and reduction in loan origination costs, primarily driven by technology initiatives, which enabled us to reduce headcount, as Stuart mentioned. Title operating earnings were $22 million, net of non-controlling interest, compared to $18 million in the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in capital volume and our focus on cost reductions to right-size the business. Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were $3 million, compared to a loss of $1 million in the prior year. This was driven by an increase in securitization dollar volume, partially offset by a decrease in securitization margins. And then turning to multifamily. Our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of $5 million net of non-controlling interest, compared to $33 million in the prior year. There were no building sales this quarter, as compared to three transactions in the prior year. And finally, Other. This is the category of the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments. Earnings were $11 million this quarter, compared to losses of $49 million in the prior year. This quarter, earnings were largely driven by earnings related to our Rialto fund investments, while prior year losses were primarily due to non-recurring expenses. And then turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with an extremely well-positioned balance sheet. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of homebuilding cash flow and ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to make progress with our strategy to reduce years of land owned and increased our land control position. At the end of the year, our homesites owned and controlled totaled 313,000, of which 209,000 were owned and 104,000 were controlled. As Rick mentioned, our years of land supply owned decreased to 4.1 at the end of Q4 from 4.4 at the end of Q3. Our controlled homesites increased to 33% at the end of Q4 from 30% at the end of Q3. At the end of the year, we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, thereby providing $2.5 billion of available capacity. During the quarter, we retired $600 million senior notes that were due in November. This brings our senior note repayments to $1.1 billion for the year and $2.2 billion since the acquisition of CalAtlantic. During the quarter, we repurchase 1.7 million shares for a total of approximately $98 million. This brings our total for the year to 9.8 million shares, totaling $493 million. At the end of the year, our debt to total cap was 32.8, a 410 basis point improvement from the end of 2018. So now turning to guidance. I’d like to provide some high-level guidance for fiscal 2020 and then I will provide more detailed guidance for the first quarter. So for the full-year of 2020, we expect to deliver between 54,000 and 55,000 homes, with an average sales price for the year of approximately 385,000. This average sales price reflects our focus on a higher percentage of entry-level product. Our fiscal 2020 gross margin is expected to remain consistent with fiscal 2019 and it will be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Although entry-level margins tend to be slightly lower, we believe our margins for the year will benefit from our continued focus on reducing construction spend, leveraging field expenses over more deliveries and reduced interest expense as we’ve continued to pay down our senior note maturities. Our fiscal 2020 SG&A should be in the range of 8.2% to 8.3%. And as we continue to add higher volume, higher absorption entry-level communities, while also accelerating the closeout of slower paced communities to enhance returns, we expect our community count to grow 1% to 2% by the end of the year. Financial Services earnings should be in the range of $250 million to $255 million, and we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.25%, primarily due to the recent extension by Congress of energy-efficient home credits. Now, let me give you more detailed guidance for Q1 only, starting with homebuilding. We expect Q1 new orders to be in the range of 11,300 to 11,500, and our Q1 deliveries to be in the range of 9,800 to 10,000 homes. Our Q1 average sales price should be between 390,000 and 395,000. We expect our Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 19.7% to 19.8%, noting that this will be our lowest margin quarter for the year, and margins will increase throughout the year to be in the range previously stated. We expect our Q1 SG&A to be in the range of 9.4% and 9.5%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture, land sale and other categories, we expect a Q1 loss of approximately $10 million. We believe our Financial Services earnings for Q1 will be in the range of $25 to $27 million. Our multifamily operations will be at about break-even. And for the other category related to the legacy Rialto assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q1 earnings of approximately $8 million to $10 million. We expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2% of total revenues. And as previously stated, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 23.25%. The weighted average share count for the quarter should be approximately 313 million shares. And so when you roll all this together, this guidance should produce an EPS range of $0.80 to $0.85 for the quarter. So in summary, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to have strong profitability and increase in cash flow generation in 2020. And now, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Truman Patterson: Hi, good morning, everybody, and nice quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to start off kind of a multi-part question on entry-level, multiple industry participants are moving to the entry-level. Do you all see an upcoming supply imbalance or are you seeing robust enough demand that’s really allowing the entry-level communities to generate greater than historical absorption paces? And on the prior call, you all suggested that, maybe you could get the 44% entry-level in 2020. Do you think there’s possibly upside to that level given the demand that you’ve been seeing? And finally, could you just give an update on kind of the gross margin profile versus your other segments, how much of a drag it might be on your margin profile?
Stuart Miller: Truman, let me start just at a macro level and say, it’s important for everyone to remember that the entry-level part of the market has remained impaired for the longest period of time since the downturn and really had a very difficult time getting started. So that part of the market is probably the most supply constrained. When you note that a number of participants are migrating towards that market, it has most recent – more recently become accessible. Demand is very strong in that part of the market. And I think it’s going to be sometime before it gets saturated. Rick, Jon, maybe you’d like to talk about margin and…
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. So from a – from an overall mix standpoint and our position, I think, we really have benefited from the fact that this has been something that we strategically target for the last several years. We’ve been very methodical on lining up communities, repositioning products, working with our developer partners to really secure excellent positions that are sizable. When you’re dealing with a single-family or an entry-level product, you need some larger communities, because your absorption pace in these communities is much faster. So, we’re really well-positioned. From a mix standpoint, do we get up to 44%? I think, it’s too soon to tell. We’re probably in the low-40% right now, and we’re just going to see how the years evolve. From a margin standpoint, as Diane said, the margins tend to be slightly lower than our first-time move-up and move-up product, but they come with higher velocity. And as a result, the IRRs associated with the build out of those communities is much, much higher, and that’s why we focused on that. Jon, anything else?
Jon Jaffe: You covered it.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Okay, thanks for that. Your rotation towards option lots, it’s – your traction has been a little bit faster than what we’ve expected in the past couple of quarters. Could you just discuss the health of the option land market, whether these lots are becoming more available across the industry or whether this is purely the result of your land developer partners? And kind of part two of that question, could you just give an update on the strategy to expand your developer partner relationships? I believe you were at three previously, what you’re kind of thinking throughout 2020?
Rick Beckwitt: So, I think, what this really reflects is, as a management team, when we – when Stuart, Jon, and I sit down and we make a plan, we execute on the plan. And we really decided that we were going to convert and increase the amount of our option position. We worked with our regional trade partners and our regional developers and have significantly expanded that program. We haven’t necessarily entered into new arrangements with different developers. Rather, what we’ve done is expand the footprint of those relationships to other markets and that’s what you’re seeing in the increase. In addition to that, our teams out there are really leveraging the relationships they have in all of their markets to increase that percentage.
Truman Patterson: Okay, thanks, guys.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Alan Ratner: Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats on the very strong performance. So I was hoping to drill in a little bit just in terms of your thinking right now on the capital allocation. You mentioned, the focus on return several times. And this year was a huge year for cash flow as you were expecting, so great to see that it come to fruition. If I look at how you spend your cash this year, debt on the balance sheet came down by about $800 million, buybacks were about $500 million. I know a lot of builders say the first and main use of cash is for growing the business, but it certainly seems like you’re in a pretty enviable position where you can do that and throw off a lot of cash flow. So should we think about the, generally, the use of cash this year towards debt reduction and buyback is kind of how you’re thinking about prioritizing that or has that shifted at all given the fact that your debt to capital is now down to that 30% type level?
Stuart Miller: So, as we noted in our comments, we expect to continue to pay down debt certainly, as it comes due. I think we noted that over the next year, over 2020, we have about $600 million of longer-term debt coming due. You can expect that we’ll pay that down out of cash flow. But additionally, returns to shareholders focus on returning of capital to shareholders is something that will be continued and properly balanced. As we’ve looked at our business and looked at our growth expectations, normal operations today are cash flow positive. As we noted, last year we produced $1.6 billion, and we expect to continue that trend and more. And that excess capital is going to be balanced exactly as noted. We’re very focused on our balance sheet, very focused on total shareholder return.
Alan Ratner: Thank you for that, Stuart. And second question, if I could on the SFR, the expansion there. First off, I guess, just more housekeeping. Were there any orders this quarter that, that flowed through the order line that works geared towards SFR? And I guess, more high-level, as you start to build these homes and existing communities, can you talk a little bit about the product that you’re building for rental? Is it comparable to your for sale product? And if so, is there any concern about cannibalizing that piece of the business, or is it being priced differently that, that it shouldn’t compete?
Stuart Miller: So let me just start off by saying is that, right now, this business is very small in the grand scheme of things. And what we’ve really done is focused on positioning to grow something that’s substantive. So from an order perspective for the last quarter, the orders associated with this were de minimis. What we’ve really been focusing on is identifying markets that we can build a good business that is focused on providing products that the market needs. Within our existing communities, what we’ve really done is looked at sectioning off different phases or sections of the community that will be priced completely differently than our other sale for product. So smaller footprint, lower specification levels, not a lot of change from home-to-home pretty identical features right down the street.
Alan Ratner: Got it.
Rick Beckwitt: But let me back up for a second and say this. SFR has been a part of the sales program for the past two years, both in our company and others. It’s basically been on a one-off basis. It’s more mom-and-pop-oriented. What we have been innovating over the past years and we dilated this in Reno. It’s a continuation of that. It’s a more structured program and we’ve been focusing on looking at single-family plan for rent communities, which is where we have innovated and our kind of branding going forward a new way of thinking about single-family for rent. We are at the early stages of this. It has been an evolutionary track for the company. You’re going to see others follow suit. Capital is starting to understand this business, and this will be an emergent story as we go forward. But the single-family for rent that we’re talking about is single-family communities for rent, which will be – there’ll be a circle around that community. While there will be similarities with other single-family product, it won’t be directly competitive, but instead, this product is going to enable a consumer that wants single-family, but might not quite be able to get into a for sale program, very enthusiastic about this and it’s a uniquely Lennar branded program.
Jon Jaffe: I just had two points. One is, we don’t think it will cannibalize our existing product at all. It’s the same product. It’s really filling the need, as Stuart just mentioned, of a consumer that can afford to buy and doesn’t make sense for them to buy. The other point is, the focus on this for us will further enhance our builder of choice position with the trade as we have more volume and this is even more consistent and higher volume. So we see that as being very complimentary to our construction platform.
Alan Ratner: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. My first question I had is focusing just on some of your comments around inventory and driving returns and the resulting cash flow. I don’t know if I heard and maybe totally don’t give, but I was just trying to get a sense when you talked about having inventory, your balance of inventory down $3 billion over the next two years, I was wondering if you could give us what that number is, or at the end of this year, just to get a sense of where that number could go? And with that amount of inventory balance reduction, should we be expecting potentially an acceleration of share repurchase with the use of that, as that cash frees up? I mean, obviously, you have a $1.2 billion of debt due next year. But given you’re still declining debt to cap, I would assume, you’d want some debt on the balance sheet and you can kind of push that maturity out. So just trying to get a sense again of the finer numbers around that, that inventory reduction and how we should think about the use of that cash?
Stuart Miller: Well, let me start off by just generally telling you how we look at the dollar value difference. Yes, we’ve told you that what we want to do is take our own supply from 4.1 years to three years by 2021. And if you step back and you look at it, you can calculate that two different ways. We – which – it’s about one year of land purchase, so we buy about $3 billion of land a year. So $3 billion sort of sums up to that number. Looking at it in a different way, based on our guidance of 50 – 54,000 to 55,000 homes for next year. If we don’t have to buy the homesites associated with that, our average lot finished homesite or underdeveloped, in some cases, finished our homesite is about 54,000, 55,000, which gets you to the same $3 billion number.
Rick Beckwitt: And so, look, it’s a pretty straight math calculation to look at the $3 billion number. Mike, you’re correct in highlighting that this is additive to cash flow, as we migrate in this direction. We do expect that cash flow will continue to benefit from our inventory and land strategy. And I think that your question is, does that mean that we accelerate things like debt and shareholder – a return of capital to shareholders? And the answer to that is decidedly, yes.
Michael Rehaut: Great, thank you. I guess, second question just a little bit finer tuning granularity around order growth and how to think about that for the upcoming year? Obviously, you gave first quarter guidance and as well as community count growth expected to be 1% or – 1% to 2%, I believe, for the year as soon as a year-end over year-end if you could clarify that? But how should we think about the sales pace component of that, given that you’ve kind of mentioned that you continue to expect to shift a little bit more towards entry-level, which is higher, sales pace versus other segments, other buyer segments, as well as the fact that, you’d expect the broader market to continue to improve a little bit, given where we are with rates and affordability, et cetera? So, just trying to kind of break out the pieces of that, I think expectations perhaps are in a low to mid single-digit type of range for sales pace growth. But any thoughts around how you’re thinking about that for the first quarter and the full year would be very helpful?
Jon Jaffe: Hey, Mike, it’s Jon. First of all, that is correct. It’s your year-end to year-end comparison. As we think about pace, it really goes back to my commentary about a very disciplined production approach and matching sales pace to that. So to the extent that the market is stronger or not, we’ll adjust pricing accordingly. So we expect our pace to be a consistent one. And to the extent, the market is stronger, we would hope that we’ll see improvement in margins over what we’re projecting. To the extent that the market were to soften, we expect the pace to be consistent and we would do some reflection of that in our margins.
Rick Beckwitt: I’d say additionally, that, as part of our land and inventory management program, looking internally, we have clearly focused on more of our higher-paced communities and focusing on those communities with greater absorption. And we’ve clearly and decidedly been pruning some of the slower-pace communities that might have come from CalAtlantic legacy that, that are more of a drag on some of our returns. So this is all part of our inventory management program. And we’ve been looking community by community to enhance that the absorption rate, therefore, enhancing returns.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. So just to be clear, then, given that shift that you’re describing Stuart, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect an order growth rate for the year that would exceed the community count growth that you’re looking for?
Stuart Miller: Well, I think that definitely. I mean, if you just look at the guidance we gave with regard to deliveries, the delivery growth is higher than the increase in communities. So you’ll get a natural increase in overall sales that are greater than the 1% to 2% growth in community count.
Rick Beckwitt: And that’s a more efficient, more effective business model.
Stuart Miller: That’s right. We’ve strategically focused on getting higher velocity out of each community, as opposed to growing communities at a higher rate.
Michael Rehaut: Right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Your line is open.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks. Happy New Year, everybody.
Stuart Miller: Good morning, Carl.
Carl Reichardt: Jon, I wanted to ask a little bit about subcontractor trade costs, obviously, starts for a flat this year, we build a reporting some really significant order growth and move to the entry-level, which increases number of units started sort of it for two reasons: one, the velocity and also just business is better. How are you thinking about the trades? You didn’t seem like they had a lot of overcapacity or not enough work last year? Are they going to look even with your scale and trying to get more aggressive on their pricing to you? And how do you combat that? Is it just scale? Is it just product simplicity and a focus on everything’s included and even flow? I’m just curious what your perspective is, maybe not just this year, but also maybe for a year or two?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. Well, as you look backward, and as you look forward, there is a severe shortage of labor in the industry, particularly skilled labor. And we really don’t see that improving, because a lot of the labor out there is actually aging out from the workforce. So we expect that pressure to continue. And as we started several years ago, we really thought about the fact that as volume grows, there’ll be more pressure on the system. And that’s why we really reinvented ourselves with its focus of being the builder of choice. So it’s much more than just volume and scale that has a big part, that’s strategically positioned us to be most desirable, but it has everything to do with this even flow production and predictability that gives trades or everything is included platform is really critical, because one of the big obstacles for trade is that they go out to a job site and it’s not ready for them. That inefficient use of labor that’s already in short supply, backed up on itself and creates real issues. And because of that, the trades find us more favorable to work for to get the jobs run smoother than more predictable. They don’t have the starts and stops of options and upgrades. And so we are continuing to focus on how do we get even better at that, at least, even more disciplined about even flow. So that, as we move forward, the trades you’re actually able to make more money on our business, because it’s efficient, not because we’re paying them more.
Carl Reichardt: That makes sense. And then Stuart or Rick, just on pricing, again, the mix to the entry-level more price sensitive customer. We’ve seen builders in the past, use price to control pace, so that production can actually catch up. But you’re running even flow and your mix is changing. How do you look at your pricing power as you head into this year with such robust demand? But what’s likely to be a more price sensitive consumer? And obviously, using dynamic pricing, I’m sure it’s helping manage pace? But again, is this different than what we’ve seen in the past, where builders were shoving price to try to hold the pace off?
Stuart Miller: Yes. I don’t think it’s different. It’s – for us, it’s going to be, as we’ve said, to be on a very consistent pace. And if the market is strong, right, they’re currently is showing signs of now, as Stuart said, it’s strong. And we see that across our markets that we will have pricing power greater than we had in the last year or two. That will unfold, as the months go by, and we’ll see exactly what the market is like. But as we look at it right now, it is strong. And we would expect to be able to benefit from that.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. And I think the thing to focus on, we will solve to price, whether that’s a higher price or lower price, but we’re very focused on net operating margin for each community.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks, Rick. Thanks, all.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Good quarter. Thanks for the information regarding your outlook for the year and the quarter. I had a little question about the interplay of the margins and the order cadence you suggested in 1Q. And I guess, in general, my question is your margin assumption for the quarter versus the year, since you said that you expected the first quarter to be the low in the year and you gave a pretty healthy guide for the full-year? Can you give us a sense for when in the year you’re expecting to see that, that fairly meaningful step up in the margin? Is that going to be like how to 2Q, 3Q events? Or is that something that you’re sort of envisioning will happen later in the year? And if it is, like as soon as the second quarter, is that a reflection of the current environment allowing you to get better price than the order comment you made up about 8% would suggest?
Jon Jaffe: Hey, Steve, it’s Jon. As an overview, remember, that our first quarter is always our lowest from a volume perspective, and therefore, our field has spread out. It has a bigger impact on the margins in the first quarter. And you always see that trend with us. So what we don’t see it sequentially throughout the year, our margins will improve as we get greater field leverage, just purely based on volume. The improvement is throughout the year, though, based on what we expect to see with this more efficient, both gross margin and operating margin out of the efficiencies, we’re gaining in our systems and our costs and our SG&A that should flow through all of our numbers. So it’s really the combination of those two things progressing throughout the year.
Diane Bessette: Yes, Stephen, maybe the only thing I’d add is, I think, if you look at the growth of gross margin in 2019 that would give you a really good proxy for what we’re expecting in 2020 with the back-half of the year having the highest increase in margin.
Stephen Kim: Got it. All right, that’s helpful. Secondly, I was really intrigued by this comment, Stuart, you made about how you saw the improvement in the Financial Services business and I guess, specifically, you cited the mortgage origination business and some of the tech initiatives that you’ve got going on there. As I believe, you used the word proxy for what we might see from many of your other tech initiatives across the company. And I was curious if you could give us a little bit of a preview as to what you meant by that. I think you had said, homebuilding customer acquisition costs and even flow in construction management, as I think about some of the initiatives you’ve got, obviously, you have the eye buyer investments in open door, which could lead to customer acquisition costs. Could – but I’m particularly intrigued by this even flow in construction management. How – in what way could be improvement we saw in your mortgage origination business be a proxy for that?
Stuart Miller: So thank you for listening to the call carefully, Steve. Yes, that’s exactly what I said. And it starts with the fact that, that in our Financial Services group, which is where we really initiated many of our technology initiatives, we had a management team start to dip the toe than a foot than a leg into the technology stream. And as they became more entrenched, there was kind of a feedback loop that began. That said, wow, this really does have import. This really can have impact. And the more we did, the more we explored, the more we found, we could change the way that our business operates. If you think about the migration from, I think, it was $8,600, $8,700 per loan in 2017 towards a 6,000 or 5,600 per loan cost of origination. That’s a sizable step over a fairly short period of time. And it comes from management focus and integration of new technologies new ways of doing business that hadn’t been done or tried before. And the feedback that comes from early successes, feeding the adventure of drilling deeper and trying more. We’re starting to see many of those things happen in and around our dynamic pricing program. We’ve talked about it before. Early adoption starts to breed some early successes, it takes sometime for those earlier successes to start accelerate, start to accelerate and start to translate into real cost reductions. But we’re starting to see real efficiency in the way that our inventory turns. If we look back from this year’s at year-end back to last year’s year-end, the efficiency with which we’re driving closings through the year is having real bottom line impact in the way that our business has configured and we think that, that will accelerate. As it relates to customer acquisition, we’ve talked about a number of our initiatives, open door being one of them, but other – others of them are more internally focused about customer acquisition, and then lead scoring, developing into a driven-focused Internet sales consultant approach to the way that we handle our customers. We think that, that as it starts to drive as we start to drive adoption, we’ll drive costs down inefficiencies up. So there are a lot of initiatives going on behind the scenes. If you would ask me this question at the beginning of the innovation cycle in Financial Services, it would have been hard to demonstrate the specific areas, where costs would come from, but its management focus, early successes and adoption and that cycle that drives the cost structure down. And I think that the Financial Services group in that regard is a proxy for the way that we’re seeing things starting to happen on the homebuilding side as well. Does that help?
Stephen Kim: Yes. No, that’s very interesting. I guess, just the one little clarification on my part would be the numbers you gave around the mortgage cap, mortgage origination costs declining. I assume you’re implying from that, that your improvement that you traced out for us has been better than what you believe the industry overall has been. So that’s not just an industry issue, that’s a Lennar issue. And similarly, you expect that in these other avenues as well, is that correct?
Stuart Miller: Listen, I can’t really look at what the rest of the industry is doing at a micro level. But from what we understand at a macro level, the costs within the industry have been migrating higher and we are an outlier in that regard.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: You’re welcome. How about one more question?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Charles Brown: Good morning. This is actually Charles Brown filling in for Susan. Thanks for taking my question and congratulation on strong results.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Charles Brown: I was just wondering if you can provide an update on some of your key markets, such as Florida, Texas and California? And also specifically for Texas, if you think your success in this region is reflective of your recent initiative in this market?
Stuart Miller: So let’s start with Texas. I can tell you that we had strong performance in each one of our Texas markets, San Antonio, Austin, Dallas and Houston, all up high double digits. The region was up 48% year-over-year in orders. And it really is driven by the fact that we’ve completely repositioned to a much higher percentage of entry-level product. Right now, we’re about 50% of our sales and communities are below $250,000 price point, and about 70% of our communities are below 300,000. So it’s the strength of that reposition that’s really fueling the market there. With regard to Florida, since Florida are very strong, particularly on the lower price points and that first time move-up, and that really is across the board. It’s about the North and East West. Jon, do you want to talk about California?
Jon Jaffe: California has clearly seen a recovery, if you look at it from a year-over-year perspective, the prior year, California really fallen off and the pause affected California perhaps more than any other parts of the country. What we saw in the fourth quarter was a much healthier market, a clear recovery back to normal sales paces. Even in the Bay Area, which was perhaps the most impaired by a market slowdown in fourth quarter 2018. We’ve seen that market come back to life. I wouldn’t describe that as robust yet, but certainly a lot healthier.
Charles Brown: Okay. Thank you for your time, guys.
Stuart Miller: All right, very good. Well, I thank, everybody, for joining us on our call. We look forward to reporting in 2020. As you can hear, we’re pretty enthusiastic about the year to come and look forward to apprised. Thank you all for joining.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning and thank you. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffee, our President; Diane Bessette, Chief Financial Officer; and David Collins, who you just heard from. We're out in California today with our Board. We have our Board Meeting tomorrow, but we're touring our Board on some of our properties out in California, showing them what makes us the company that we are. I'm going to start today with a brief overview. Rick and Jon are going to give some additional operational remarks, and Diane will deliver further detail on our third quarter numbers as well as some additional guidance for the remainder of this year. As always, when we get to Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. So, let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to report a very strong third quarter performance that reflects both the continued recovery in the housing market as well as continued focus on leveraging our size and scale and delivering greater cash flow and higher returns. Our results reflect the fact that the housing market continued to strengthen throughout the third quarter, confirming and continuing the trend that we reported in our earnings call last quarter. The market for new homes has been improving from last year's pause as lower interest rates have stimulated demand and improved affordability, while the overall fundamentals of the economy have remained strong. We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the third quarter, as a combination of lower interest rates together with slower price appreciation have positively impacted affordability. And that together with low unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence, and economic growth drove the consumer to return to a more affordable housing market.  Current market conditions are strong, and they've been continuing to improve as the production deficit driven short supply, lower interest rates, and attractive pricing have motivated consumers. In the third quarter, we achieved strong net earnings of over $513 million or $1.59 per share. This result derived mostly from solid operating results from both Homebuilding and Financial Services. In Homebuilding, stronger sales drove, and are driving, stronger than expected deliveries at stabilized margin levels of 20.4%, the high-end of our guidance as incentives have moderated. While deliveries jumped 7% over last year and new orders improved 9% over last year, our size and scale in most of the best markets in the country enabled us to offset the impact of rising land costs with production cost savings and overhead leverage, which has driven our SG&A to an all-time third quarter low of 8.3%. And we're confident that these trends are going to continue into the fourth quarter. Our Financial Services performance also contributed to our earnings beat, and I want to focus on this for a couple of minutes as this performance is a proxy for many of the important initiatives driving our company today. At the beginning of the quarter, we expected the contribution from this segment to be approximately $54 million. By the end of the current quarter, our Financial Services segment generated a record quarterly profit of $78.8 million or an improvement of about 45% from our expectations. It's noteworthy that having sold our retail mortgage component, our retail title component and our retail home insurance agency, we no longer drive additional volume from spikes in the mortgage refi business that has been booming as rates have gone down. We are only producing from our core business. While some of this beat derives from market conditions, much of the performance story from this segment is about shedding non-core assets, which enables our management team to focus on the core homebuilding-oriented business and implement new technologies to streamline the remaining business process, all while improving our customers' experience. This core focus drove significant operational improvement versus the prior year with fewer assets deployed as follows. First, we increased the company's combined mortgage capture rate from 71% to 77%, having integrated the CalAtlantic business, which had much lower capture rates than where Lennar historically operated. Second, and perhaps most importantly, we've reduced the cost to originate a loan by 22% from $7,700 per loan to approximately $6,000 per loan, and this is a continuation of the operational improvements, which have now driven the origination costs down 33% from $9,000 per loan in 2017. And then third, we've reduced the total Financial Services associate headcount by over 50% from approximately 3,700 associates with the announcement of CalAtlantic to now below 1,600 associates. The technology initiatives implemented include robotic processes to automate repetitive detail-oriented tasks that eliminate human error and manual intervention. These initiatives are helping our journey to reduce paper flow, streamline the closing process, and drive a friendlier customer experience. Technology, together with management focus, has enabled efficiency, a better customer experience, and a much better bottom line. Our management team has been focused on incorporating new technologies on our old operating chassis to both drive down costs and to create significantly better customer experience in mortgage with our Blend partnership, in title and escrow services with our States Title partnership, and home insurance with our Hippo insurance partnership.  And although ultimately, we will improve our entire end-to-end process to get to a one-tap closing, we're really starting to see the fruits of our focus and investment at the bottom line right now. And these improvements specifically and these types of improvements generally are sustainable and will continue to drive bottom line improvement in our Financial Services segment and across our company in the future. Moving on, while strong operating results drove the bottom line, our overall focus on inventory, land spend, and shedding non-core assets has driven a strong and improving cash flow picture as well. First, we are reducing our overall inventory levels as we have had a relentless focus on our pivot to land-lighter strategy. From the timing of land purchases to the duration of the land that we buy to the percentage of optioned versus owned land, we are migrating towards a significantly smaller land inventory driving our business forward. Second, we are also driving our asset base lower as we continue to focus on monetizing non-core assets and migrating to a core, pure play homebuilding and financial services platform. As noted, we have shed various non-core Financial Services assets this year. We continue to divest and monetize various remnant Rialto assets, and we're working on finding proper positioning for other ancillary businesses as well, and the latter will happen as quickly as is practical. With that said, strong operating results together with our focus on overall inventory reduction has increased our expected cash flow for this year to $1.5 billion and projected annual cash flow expectations for 2020 are continuing to head towards the $2 billion mark. Our strong cash flow and strong cash position enables us to repay $500 million of debt at the beginning of the quarter, while also opportunistically repurchasing another 6 million shares of stock at an average price of about $48.5 a share through the quarter, and we will pay off another $600 million of debt from cash flow right at year-end. At quarter-end, we had a debt-to-total cap ratio of approximately 37%, which is a 300-basis point improvement over last year. And while we're not giving specific guidance for 2020 at this time, we're very optimistic about the prospects for next year. Accordingly, we expect to generate strong cash flow for the remainder of 2019 and expect to continue to use excess cash flow to both pay down debt, while we continue to opportunistically repurchase stock. We expect to see our margins improve steadily throughout the remainder of the year as prices remain stable and incentives continue to subside and ensure that we achieve our 2019 closing target of now approximately 51,000 homes. We are confident that we'll achieve this target, which frankly would have been higher except for the hurricane activity that slowed production at the end of the quarter. Before I turn over to Rick, Jon and Diane, let me just say that we remain encouraged by both Lennar's position and market conditions for the remainder of the year. Our size and scale in each of our strategic market continues to facilitate the management of costs and production in a land and labor constrained market. Our focus on technology is driving efficiency that is reflected in our consistent improvement in SG&A and our bottom line. Our strong cash flow and bottom-line profitability are continuing to enable us to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders. Our strong balance sheet continues to improve and position us for the future. And our strategy of shedding noncore assets continues to drive an intensified focus on our core homebuilding and financial services businesses. As the homebuilding market continues to improve in the wake of the recent pause, we are optimistic about our ability to deliver strong and consistent performance for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. With that, let me turn over to the rest of the team. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. We had a strong quarter, driven by solid execution of our operating strategy. Homebuilding revenues for the third quarter totaled $5.4 billion, representing a 3% increase from 2018. This was driven by a 7% increase in deliveries to 13,522 homes and a 5% decrease in average sales price. Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high-end of our guidance as we were able to accelerate some fourth quarter closings into the third quarter as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage rates. Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 20.4%, which was just shy of the top side of our prior guidance and up 30 basis points sequentially from the second quarter. This sequential improvement benefited from direct cost savings and was slightly impacted by an increase in the number of closings coming from lower margin third party option contracts versus land we've developed. This is in line with our land lighter strategy that is focused on maximizing cash flow and internal rates of return. I will discuss this in greater detail in a bit. Our SG&A in the quarter was 8.3%. This marks an all-time third quarter low and highlights the power of our increased local market scale and operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings totaled $659 million, up 8% from the prior year, and net earnings for the quarter totaled $513 million, up 13% from 2018. New orders for the quarter increased 9% to 13,369 homes, exceeding the high-end of our Q3 guidance. New orders increased in each of our Homebuilding segments with August being the strongest month in the period. From a dollar value perspective, new orders totaled $5.2 billion, which was up 3% from the prior year. Our average new order sales price declined 5% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting our continued focus on the strong entry level market. The entry level market now accounts for about 40% of our business, and this will continue to increase as more first-time buyer communities come online and increase our overall community count in 2020. During our third quarter, we saw increased demand which benefited from lower mortgage rates and increased homebuyer sentiment. Our sales pace per community increased 10% year-over-year. We continue to experience solid traffic on both our website and at our Welcome Home Centers and are optimistic that sales will continue to be strong in Q4. We ended the third quarter with a sales backlog of 18,908 homes, with a dollar value of $7.6 billion. This backlog, combined with our current housing inventory, puts us in a great position to close about 51,000 homes in fiscal 2019. As we look forward to 2020, we are laser-focused on improving our returns on capital and generating significant cash flow. With this in mind, increasing our percentage of option homesites and reducing the amount of owned home sites are top priorities. At the beginning of this year, we set a two-year goal of having 40% of our homesites controlled via options and similar arrangements. We made great strides on this front in the third quarter as our percentage improved from 25% to 30%. This increase reflects the strength of our relationship with local developers and their desire to work with us to increase our option position, given our size and scale in our markets. We expect to continue to expand on our existing relationships and enter new regional and national land platforms over the next 12 months. Based on this, we are now increasing our goal of controlled homesites to between 40% to 50% of our land needs. During the third quarter, we also made progress reducing our years owned supply of homesites from 4.5 years to 4.4 years and continue to target a goal of three years. As we reach these two goals, it will enable us to reduce our on-balance sheet land spend and purchase homesites on a takedown basis much closer to the start of the home. This will generate additional cash flow and drive meaningfully greater returns. Consistent with our land-light strategy and focus on increasing returns, we are continuing to develop a program to address the single-family rental market. There is no question that there is a shortage of affordable and workforce housing, and new single-family rental communities can help solve this problem. Given this shortage, there is intense investor interest in new single-family rental communities where the owner can leverage the overhead costs of managing the rentals because they're all the same community with identical features from home to home and Lennar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. Last quarter we highlighted our single-family rental program where our homebuilding operation is building and selling homes in bulk in a community on land owned by a third party with no lease-up risk to Lennar. We love this expansion of our core business as it allows us to leverage our homebuilding machine and existing overhead, and it will generate high returns and profits, all with no accompanying land or lease-up risk. This is a perfect expansion of our land-light strategy. And given our strong relationship with landowners and developers and our low cost and speed of construction, we are optimistic that we can increase deliveries in the next couple of years. Additionally, this program provides an interesting and unique hedge to our for-sale business. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. Today I want to speak about our focus on cost reduction across our platform. First, I'll discuss our significant size and scale that led to Lennar becoming the builder of choice, resulting in reduced direct construction costs and advantageous cycle times. With respect to direct construction costs, I mentioned on our last earnings call that we looked forward at the next few quarters and saw that directionally our direct construction costs were decreasing. This bore out in our third quarter as we saw our direct costs were down sequentially from Q2 by $0.99 per square foot or 1.6%. From a year-over-year perspective, our direct costs were up just 3%. This represents the lowest rate of year-over-year increase in 11 quarters and compares favorably to a year-over-year rate of 7% just last quarter. We have visibility into the continuation of this trend over the next few quarters as we review the direct costs for homes delivered in Q3 by the quarterly cohort that the homes were started in. Looking at these sequential cohorts, it's very clear that our direct costs are trending down over each subsequent quarter and will contribute positively to our gross margins going forward. Sequentially, in Q3 our material costs were down 3.5% from Q2. Significantly, over 65% of our material cost line items were lower sequentially, with the biggest declines coming from lumber, drywall and exterior finishes. As I've previously discussed, lumber represent the largest single cost item at approximately 13% of total direct costs. Lumber reached its low in December 2018 and has since remained in a range averaging about $350 per 1,000 board feet. On the labor side of costs, the severity of the labor shortage in the construction industry has not abated, but our labor costs moved up just 1% sequentially in Q3 over Q2. We see across all of our markets that our Builder of Choice focus is playing out to allow Lennar to minimize the impacts of this labor shortage. Some real-time examples of this as we have national and regional manufacturers struggling with critical labor shortages and supply interruptions. In three separate situations, these suppliers, who are strategic partners of Lennar, are flying in crews and materials from other regions of the country to complete the work on Lennar communities. These are a few examples demonstrating that our size and scale allow us to get above and beyond responses to rectify issues. This is further evidence of our ability to attract trades to our job sites away from other builders, enabling Lennar to have significant cycle time advantages. Size and scale, combined with even flow production in our everything's included platform provides a consistent, predictable volume for our trades. Let me now turn to SG&A for a moment. Given our significant size and scale, we are leveraging our overhead with a focus on simplifying all of our operations, systems and processes to allow our associates to operate more efficiently. We continue to gain operating leverage through simplifying our systems, processes and procedures. As a result, our associates have become significantly more efficient and productive, resulting in our year-over-year personnel spending flat where our volume increased by 7%. We continue to leverage technology to reduce our customer acquisition cost spend by sourcing higher quality online customer leads. Our focus is on the quality of our internet leads, not just quantity. Through rigorous A/B testing of digital marketing strategies and tactics, we deliver higher quality leads to our internet sales team. The result is, our internet leads defined as someone who request specific information and give us their contact information are up 50% over last year. The resulting high volume of high-quality leads reduces realtor spend and delivers more volume across the fixed costs of our sales platform. I will conclude by echoing what you heard from both Stuart and Rick. We are laser-focused on improving our net operating margin, free cash flow, and return on capital. To achieve these goals, our program is simple: maximize efficiency; be land-light; have everything's included even flow production, with sales matched to the production pace; drive direct costs down through strategic Builder of Choice partnerships; and use technology and leverage to reduce our SG&A. Now, I'll turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning to everyone. So, let me summarize and reemphasize a few points from our third quarter and starting with Homebuilding. So, looking at deliveries, you've heard that our deliveries increased 7% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of June guidance by 2% as we benefited from a favorable interest rate environment. Our third quarter gross margin on home sales was 20.4%, which was at the higher end of our June guidance. The prior year's gross margin was 20.3%, including CalAtlantic's purchase accounting, and 21.9%, excluding purchase accounting. Q3 2019 gross margins were impacted by lower average sales prices as we strategically repositioned our product to target more first-time homebuyers and lower-priced homes. Gross margin was also impacted by an increase of 60 basis points in sales incentives year-over-year. So, incentives decreased sequentially by 30 basis points. Additionally, while construction costs were up 3% year-over-year, there was a decrease sequentially of 1.6% as we realized the benefits of our size and scale. Our third quarter SG&A was 8.3%, which is the lowest third quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved, and was at the lower end of our June guidance. This compared to 8.5% in the prior year. The improvement, as Jon mentioned, was primarily a result of continued operating leverage due to size and scale in our markets and our focus on technology initiatives. Turning to new orders. New orders increased 9% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of June guidance by 4%. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 16%. And then looking at absorptions, absorption for the third quarter was 3.4 versus 3.1 in the prior year, and we ended the quarter with about 1,300 active communities. And finally, for Homebuilding joint venture land sales and the Other categories, we had a combined earnings of $18 million, compared to a $3 million loss in the prior year. The current quarter primarily benefited from $12 million of gross profit on land sales and also 12 million [earnings] of other income, largely related to the sale of two club houses, both as a result of our continued focus on cash generation, and this was partially offset by about $10 million of losses from our joint ventures. Now turning to Financial Services. So, looking at the results in total, operating earnings were a record 79 million, net of noncontrolling interests compared to 61 million in the prior year and the details as follows. Mortgage operating earnings increased to 57 million from 34 million in the prior year, and as you heard us mention, mortgage earnings improved primarily due to a higher capture rate of increased Lennar deliveries, as well as reductions in loan origination costs, driven in part by technology initiatives. These items more than offset the decrease in retail origination volume as a result of the sale of substantially all of our retail mortgage business in Q1 of 2019. Title operating earnings were 18 million, compared to 22 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the sale of the majority of our retail agency business and title insurance underwriter business to States Title in Q1 of 2019, which resulted in a 56% decrease in title revenue. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in captive closed orders and a decrease in operating expenses. Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were consistent with the prior year at about $4 million. A decrease in securitization dollar volume was offset by an increase in securitization margins. And then turning to Multifamily. Our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of $11 million, net of noncontrolling interests, compared to a loss of 4 million in the prior year. There was one building sale this quarter that resulted in the segment's $13 million share of gains, compared to one sale in the prior year that resulted in the segment's $2 million share of gains. And then on the Lennar Other category. This is the category for the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments. Earnings were $16 million in this quarter, compared to $10 million in the prior year, and this was largely driven by higher earnings related to the Rialto fund investments that we've retained. And then finally looking at our tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.1%, which was lower than our guidance of 25.5%, primarily due to energy credits that our team was able to generate this quarter. And then turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $795 million of cash, and at the end of the quarter our homesites owned and controlled were 310,000 of which 70% are owned and 30% are controlled, which is an improvement, as Rick mentioned, from 25% controlled in the prior quarter. And as we've said, our year's supply owned decreased sequentially from 4.5 to 4.4. Land acquisition spend during the quarter was 691 million and land development was 645 million. We had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 700 million, leaving 1.7 billion of available capacity. During the quarter, we retired 500 million senior notes due in June, and since the acquisition, as Stuart mentioned, of CalAtlantic, we've retired 1.6 billion of senior notes. As we mentioned during the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock for a total of 295 million, and this brings our repurchase activity to 8.1 million shares or 395 million so far this year. At the end of the quarter, our homebuilding debt to total cap ratio was 37.1, which improved 100 basis points from the prior year and 120 basis points sequentially. Stockholders' equity increased to 15.4 billion and our book value per share grew to [$48.40] per share. So, now turning to guidance. I'd like to give a little bit of guidance for the fourth quarter. Starting with Homebuilding. We expect new orders to be between 12,200 and 12,400. We expect to deliver between 18,500 and 16,000 homes. This estimate includes the impact of the hurricane that Stuart mentioned, as well as the acceleration of deliveries into Q3 that Rick referenced. We expect our Q4 average sales price to be between $385,000 and $390,000. We expect our Q4 gross margin to be in the range of 21.25% to 21.5%, and our SG&A to be in the range of 7.7% to 7.8%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we expect a loss – a Q4 loss of approximately 20 million. Turning to Financial Services. We believe our Financial Services earnings will be between $68 million and $70 million. We believe our Multifamily segment will be about breakeven, and for the other category related to the Rialto legacy assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q4 deliveries to be between $5 million and $10 million. We expect our corporate G&A to be about 1.4% of total revenues, and we expect our tax rate to be about 25.5%. The weighted average share count for Q4 should be about 317 million shares, and this estimate does not include any additional share repurchases that we might opportunistically pursue. This guidance should produce an EPS range of $1.81 to $1.94. In summary, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate strong profitability, increased cash flow, and improved returns for the balance of 2019 and continuing into 2020. And now, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: It is now time for the question-and-answer session for today's call. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.
Trey Morrish: This is actually Trey on for Steve. So, first I wanted to ask little about on the orders front. The West, Central in your Texas region, all were pretty good, up 10% or more, but the East appeared to be lagging a bit. Is there something unique in that geography or is there something a little bit more comp related that was more difficult in the quarter? We’re just wondering what's kind of going on there.
Rick Beckwitt: In the year ago period, we had a lot of new communities open in the quarter, and we had a pretty strong sales period in the year ago. There is nothing going on that's abnormal or unusual. I feel that the Eastern markets are strong across the board.
Trey Morrish: Okay. And then you highlighted this quarter that your closings benefited from pull-forward deliveries due to lower rates, and it's also something you talked about last quarter as well. I'm just wondering, is that something that is included – or that dynamic, is that included in your fourth quarter guide or is that something that could again ultimately be a little bit of upside to your numbers?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I think with regard to the acceleration of people's desire to close, when rates move people lock, and they don't want to lose the opportunity, and we just saw some people do that in the third quarter. And if there is a similar phenomenon in Q4, then we'd expect something like that as well, but we haven't put that in our guidance.
Trey Morrish: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. So, it's been almost two years – roughly two years since you initially announced the acquisition of CalAtlantic, and I thought it might be helpful maybe you can share with us with respect to the aspects of the integration where you've been most pleasantly surprised, and were there other areas that you still think there are untapped opportunities that you can capitalize on with the dominant scale that you have. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Jon Jaffe: Ivy, it's Jon. I'd say, most pleasantly surprised with how quickly and smoothly the integration went across the entire platform. So, to me, it's not one particular area that stands out, but everyone very quickly was on the same page. There was no confusion about do you turn left or right, and a very quick transition to everything's included out in the communities to have our consumer-facing front all on the same page. Same thing as you look across our internet, digital marketing platform, same thing as you look across our land acquisition discipline. Everybody really is in lockstep pulling in the same direction, and I'd say that's what we're most pleased about.
Rick Beckwitt: I guess I'd add to that, Ivy. We had always assumed and expected that given the increase in scale and size in our markets that that would be a significant advantage. And if anything, we underestimated the benefit of that. And it really comes from all aspects of the business, access to labor, our cost structure, and really on the land side.
Stuart Miller: I think that – look, I think that the most remarkable part of two years – just two years passing since that announcement, and no disrespect intended, we don't even talk about the acquisition anymore. We are one Lennar, we're one company, and the vestiges of integration, things like that are far behind us. I think that as one company, we are focused on using our size and scale to really leverage every aspect of our business. You hear about it a lot relative to land, you hear about it a lot relative to production costs, and you see a lot of leverage in SG&A, and all of those components are being driven by the fact that we've got size and scale and a fully integrated program as one company, unified program.
Ivy Zelman: That's very helpful and sounds awesome, and hopefully there’s a lot more to come from the scale and your dominant position. Moving to one aspect of it with land, Rick, maybe this is for you, just to – with respect to the regional land developers that you've partnered with, I think you've talked publicly about three. Some of the clients I was chatting with at our Housing Summit, we’re talking about why is it any different than another builder who is optioning lots from a land developer. And I thought it'd be helpful, one, if you can talk about and expand it upon the three, and why is it an advantage, the relationship you have, because I think you own a portion of those companies, maybe elaborate on that, Rick, if you would.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I think the key differential is, people that we're working with are experts in going through the entitlements and really finding great pieces of properties that are a game-changer. And if you think about our core business, as a builder we don't want to really play in the entitlement space. So, these are regional folks that – this is what they do. They find opportunities before anybody else can, and we've worked with them to expand our land platform and we have expanded them into other geographies, and it's working effectively.
Jon Jaffe: Ivy, it's Jon. I'd interject that the strategic relationships, the differential between what you hear from other builders, I believe is that these are long-term ongoing relationships that will continue to produce opportunities for us over time as compared to one-off auction transactions with a developer doing a single parcel.
Ivy Zelman: Got it. Very helpful. Good luck, guys. Tanks for taking our questions.
Operator: Next question comes from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Truman Patterson: Hi. Good morning, everybody, and nice results. First, just wanted to touch on order incentives. Could you just discuss how they trended through the quarter? Possibly the magnitude of the improvement from 2Q to 3Q? And I realize it might be difficult to parse out numerically, but could you just discuss qualitatively how incentives trended by segment entry level and move up?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. We didn't have too much variability among the months in the quarter. And as we've always said, we're really focused on net pricing and focused on maximizing the value of our inventory and turning inventory. Our key focus, as Stuart, Jon, and Diane and I have said is, we're very focused on return on investment. And so net margin is really what we're focused on.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. When I'm looking out a year or so, I'm really trying to hope to understand where your growth will likely come from community count absorptions. You're starting to replace your move-up communities with higher absorbing entry level communities. Will that just lead to very modest community count improvement – I believe you alluded to it on the call previously and growth will primarily come through increased absorptions? Or do you think you have enough owned land that you can really liquidate it and grow communities regardless kind of a decent rate in 2020, call it like a mid-single-digit clip?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. We're expecting to see community count growth going into 2020 progressing through the year. And with our focus on the entry level and lower priced market, absorptions are going to be stronger given the fact that there is higher velocity in the entry level market.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.
John Lovallo: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one. I believe last year you provided delivery margin and SG&A outlook for 2019 during the third quarter. Is there any reason why you guys decided not to do that today?
Stuart Miller: There is no specific reason. We just traditionally give guidance for the following year in the fourth quarter. Last year, we made a decision strategically to accelerate that, and we've just gone back to our normal practice. As I said in my comments, we are optimistic about 2020. It's just a little premature for us to do – to give specific guidance. And I think that as we have traditionally done in the fourth quarter, we will give the guidance that we normally give.
John Lovallo: Okay. That sounds good. And then in terms of orders, are there any comments, maybe at least directionally, you can give us in terms of September and how that may have trended?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So, historically, we've not given additional guidance past the quarter's end. But as we said in our remarks, the market has been very strong, and it has continued to be improving and I think we'll go about that far. Don't want to set a new standard. But it's clear that the trend through the quarter was positive with August being our most robust month and continuing into the fourth quarter, we're seeing additional strength.
John Lovallo: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Next question comes from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets.
Mike Dahl: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Stuart, maybe just to pick up on that last comment. I think, clearly your business is seeing the strength in the numbers, and it's great to hear the positive commentary. One of the pushbacks we still get to the overall Group is just the broader macro concerns and whether or not these are really seeping into consumer behavior at this point. So, can you give us a little more color on what you're hearing from the field as buyers are balancing – affordability being restored versus maybe or maybe not being impacted at all by some of the headlines out there?
Stuart Miller: I think that we talk about this a lot. It's easy to get a little confused in today's market. There is a lot of noise in the political scene, and it certainly feels like it's creating crosscurrents. But as we look to the feedback that we're getting real-time from the customers coming to our Welcome Home Centers and talking to us about their thought process, their future, we're still seeing that underpinning the fundamentals of the economy are driving consumer sentiment. And perhaps we are more sensitive to the noise than the actual consumers. Low unemployment, generally positive job growth, a fairly strong economy, all of these things seem to be driving consumer sentiment more than some of the new stories that we see that seem to be politicized. And so, we're – as we've noted, we've seen growing strength as we went through our third quarter, and that seems to be the dominant direction. I know that there is a lot of question about upcoming potential recession and things like that. Our customers don't seem to be viewing it that way, and I think that the housing market in general seems solid and strong and continuing to improve.
Mike Dahl: Okay. That's helpful and good to hear. My second question then just specifically with respect to the fourth quarter orders guidance. If we heard it correctly, it sounds fairly robust in terms of the growth there, and there is an easier comp. But just on the question of absorption versus community count, maybe a little more detail – the comment was made growth in community count into 2020. How should we think about the balance of community count versus absorption within that fourth quarter orders guide specifically?
Stuart Miller: So, look, community count is a very complicated number. It's got a lot of moving parts. So, into the fourth quarter, we're kind of suspecting that our community count is going to be about where we are and we'll see a little bit more absorption. As I noted in my comments, our guidance for the fourth quarter has been moderated by the production slowdown that we saw relative to all the preparation work all the way up the Eastern seaboard that had to take place relative to the hurricane coming through, and that really shut down a few weeks of production. So, our guidance might have been higher had we not had that kind of blip along the way. In terms of community count, as we look into 2020, I think that what we've probably understated is the really strong relationships that are driving our land strategy overall, all the way from the way that we're migrating from owned to option programs to the access to new communities to the kind of regional and sometimes national relationships that will define the way that we own and hold land and are prepared for growth in the future, these are evolving stories that really come down to very, very strong long-term relationships that have been enhanced by our additional size and scale. And the two, relationship and size and scale, are working hand-in-hand to give us a great deal of confidence that as we think about community count going into 2020, we are on an upward trajectory, and that's going to define our growth prospects as we go forward.
Mike Dahl: Thanks for the details.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. First question. Stuart, I just wanted to expand a little bit on what you just said before regarding the land relationships, the shift toward lot optioning, the ability in sourcing of land and communities going forward, and kind of how that's allowing you to, at least directionally, say you expect to grow community count next year. With the increase of the lot optioning target from 40% to 45%, I guess maybe just asking it perhaps a little bit more bluntly, but number one, I was hoping to get a little bit of a time frame of when you'd hope to achieve that 40% to 45% range? I think in the past the 40% number was a little bit more perhaps over the next couple of years, let's say, or maybe the next 18 months even. If we're still talking about that same time frame, let's say now through the end of next year or even 2021. And secondly, as part of this question, just on your community count comments and access to land, I believe you had also talked about – with the overall soft pivot that you've been doing over the last two or three years, most recently kind of a unit volume growth objective of perhaps low-to-mid single digits. I was curious if the enhanced access to land changes that type of growth dynamic that perhaps if you're opening yourselves up to a broader enhanced set of land developers and stronger relationships, if that changes that growth calculus at all?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So, that's a lot of questions embedded in one there, Mike. So, let me see how I can do. Let me start at the end and say that we're really not changing our growth trajectory. We are refining the way that we get there, and we're really using the expanded relationships that we've got and size and scale to moderate our growth. But the access to land that we are – that we're working on and working with right now really enables us to grow as much as we perhaps want to. But we're constraining that growth in order to do it in the most effective way possible. And by constraining growth what we're enabling of ourselves is the ability to make that migration from a land-heavier to a land-lighter strategy, which is going to generate very strong cash flows that enable us to manage our balance sheet, our debt levels and our return of capital strategically. So, we're really pretty enthusiastic about that. Again, the relationships that we have that are long-term relationships, together with the size and scale that we've amassed, gives us a lot of optionality. And we know that we've highlighted a fairly aggressive target in terms of migrating from what was 20% to 25% to 30% option versus owned land relationship to a 40% to 50% level over the next couple of years, and that's an aggressive standard. But when we look at what's in our hopper and the things that we're working on and understand that when this management team focuses on something, we have a lot of tools in our toolbox. We have people who have deep, rich relationships that we can activate that stuff and make these things happen, and that's what's happening behind the scene. What we have in the hopper right now gives us a pretty good sense and confidence about being able to set high standards and expectations and then deliver on them. That's what you've seen from us in the past. That's what you're going to see from us now.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thank you, Stuart. I appreciate that. I guess if I could just – I know this first question multifaceted, but I'll see if I can sneak another one in, if you allow. On the gross margin side, obviously, it's an encouraging guide for the fourth quarter, and you're kind of continuing to see that recovery throughout this year as many builders have, you know coming off of the first half of the year when the industry kind of processed some of the higher incentive levels off the back half of 2018, should we be thinking of kind of the 21% – the low 21% as kind of a new reset baseline at this point given how the housing market has normalized and incentives have kind of receded off of those higher levels 6 to 12 months ago as we go into 2020?
Stuart Miller: So, look, there are some moving parts in this, and I'm going to let Rick kind of directly answer the question, but I want to highlight one thing first, and that is – look, land prices generally are and have been moving up. And then the migration toward a land-lighter strategy generally means you're buying more of a retail priced land asset underneath each and every home. What is exciting to us and remarkable is, as Jon properly highlighted, our size and scale is helping us offset some of those natural increases in price with some reductions in our production cost, reductions in our SG&A, to get to a net margin that is really consistent and strong going forward. So, Rick, maybe you'd like to weigh in on the direct margin question.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. So, Stuart is exactly right. There are a lot of moving pieces with regard to margin as we look at 2020 and 2021. Our focus on increasing returns has an impact on the gross margin. We will be taking land very much closer to the start of construction, and as a result, there is a trade-off between gross margin – and I've said in the past, it could be 100 basis points, 150 basis points but returns go up exponentially. And we believe that that's an important thing for us to focus on. In addition, as we move down the price curve, the entry level homes generally have a lower margin, but much, much higher IRRs associated with that. So, when we come to the fourth quarter, we'll give you guidance on where we think we'll be for 2020, but all in all, it will be a really strong profitable year.
Diane Bessette: And hi, Mike, this is Diane. Let me just take a minute why we're talking about the fourth quarter. My apologies. Deliveries for the fourth quarter should be 15,800 to 16,000 homes. So, just wanted to clarify that.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks so much, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James.
Buck Horne: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to see if you could just go in a little bit more detail on the single-family rental community platform that you're developing. And is it something that you would envision – it sounds like you're going to do it without land investment or lease-up risk. But would you actually consider expanding it to buy some land specifically targeted for that type of project? And I guess I'm also curious what kind of addressable – total addressable market you think is out there for the built for rent product? [Technical Difficulty] Hello? Hello, operator? Operator, you still there? I'm not hearing anything on the line.
Operator: Are you there? Can anybody hear me?
Buck Horne: Hello, operator? Hello? Hello, operator?
Operator: Yes.
Buck Horne: Hi, this is Buck.
Stuart Miller: Hi, Buck. Okay. Good. Do you want to go through your question again? Somehow, we had an audio problem.
Buck Horne: Yes. No worries. No worries. Sorry about that. The question was on the single-family rental community platform. And just curious, it sounds like you're doing this without land investment and without lease-up risk, but would you consider expanding to actually invest in land specifically geared to that type of community? And really just – the other question is, what kind of total addressable market you think is out there for the built for rent product? [Technical Difficulty] Operator?
Stuart Miller: Here we go. I don't know – still a little spotty. But, listen, I'd say this. I want to make clear that our single-family for rent program is an extension of our core business, and it really isn't asset sensitive extension of that business. That enables us to expand our core business. Without the risk, we're not be coming – it's not a version of our multifamily business. We're not building a new ancillary business. It's a production-oriented business as an extension of our core. And additionally, and I think we've highlighted it very well, and that is, one of the biggest problems that we have in the country right now is affordable and workforce housing, and the single-family for rent business is becoming one of the big solutions, and we are part of that solution. We have had intense inquiry from participants who want to build entire communities of single family for rent where we can do it effectively, efficiently and with high returns, and we can participate, though we're not taking either the land risk or the lease-up risk, and this is a really positive program for us. Rick, why don’t you…?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. Directly to answer your question, our primary focus is doing it in communities that are owned by a third party. That's our highest return on investment. It allows us to leverage our overhead. It allows us to build a very efficient program and build that scale fast. In addition to that, we are looking at doing single-family rental as an additional product offering in some of our existing communities, having a section of the community increase the pace and return on investment in those communities. So, it's going to be a combination of things. But as Stuart said, this is our core business. We're building, selling and closing the homes and doing it fast.
Jon Jaffe: Okay. This is Jon. I just would add one other point to this is – we have complete optionality since this is the same product as we're building for sale to go whatever direction makes the most sense in terms of meeting the market demand and producing the highest returns for us.
Buck Horne: That's extremely helpful. Thank you, guys. I will drop – given the audio problems, I'll pass it on to the next one.
Stuart Miller: I don't think it was your fault, Buck. I think it was something on our end, but thanks for your questions.
Buck Horne: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Why don't we take one more? Why don’t we take one more?
Operator: Okay. Last question comes from Matt Bouley from Barclays. Your line is open, sir.
Matt Bouley: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for fitting me in here. Just back on the entry level mix and the sales pace implications. I think, Rick, you mentioned that you are at about 40% of the business today in terms of entry-level, which kind of looks like where legacy Lennar was pre-CalAtlantic. So just – and I'll leave it here. This is my only question. As we look at 2020, just, one, kind of any sense of where that entry level mix will be next year based on the communities you've got coming on? And, two, you mentioned the sales pace should improve as a result, but are you actually thinking that you can reach sales pace levels that are accordingly consistent with where legacy Lennar was? Thank you.
Rick Beckwitt: Well, with regard to the mix in 2020, I did say that we'll be – it'll be a higher percentage of entry-level, probably moves up 2% to 3%, 4%-ish, depending on when those communities come online. We've really targeted across the board a lower price point. You can see it in our sales orders in every geographic segment of the company. And it's primarily being led by Texas and some of the Florida markets. But there is a – we've really worked on a highly engineered efficient floor plans that we're just rolling out [everywhere].
Stuart Miller: And our single-family for rent program and strategy will add to the change and the migration in that mix. Look, as we come to conclusion here today, let me just say that there are a lot of moving parts in our business that are reflected in the third quarter as all moving in the right direction, and I think that that's what you're hearing from the management team right now is we're enthusiastic about the business, we're enthusiastic about the market, and how it's shaping up as we look toward 2020. And we think that the business is on a really good track to make the changes, to make the programs and position the pieces to really have an exciting year ahead. So, thank you for joining us. We look forward to reporting our fourth quarter.
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you, and have a great day.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. You may begin.
Stuart Miller: Good morning. Thank you and good morning everybody. This morning I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffe, our President; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, our Controller; of course you just heard from Alex; and a number of others. I'm going to go ahead and start as we always do with a brief overview. Rick and Jon will give an operational update and then Diane will give further detail on our second quarter numbers as well as some additional guidance for the rest of the year. As always when we get to Q&A, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and a follow-up so that we can accommodate as many as we can .  So, let me go ahead and begin by saying that we're very pleased to report a very solid second quarter performance, reflecting both a pickup of the homes that were lost in the first quarter due to weather conditions and a general recovery in the housing market. Deliveries improved 5% over last year while new orders improved to last year's levels and exceeded the upper end of our guidance by just a little over 2%. In the second quarter, we achieved net earnings of over $421 million or $1.30 per share and our strong cash position enabled us to opportunistically repurchase another 1 million shares of stock and set up the repayments of $500 million of debt just after the quarter ended. At quarter's end and before the debt repayment, we recorded a debt to total capital ratio of 38.3%, which is a 410 basis points improvement over last year's level. Overall, our results reflect the fact that the housing markets strengthened throughout the second quarter confirming and continuing the trend that we reported on our earnings call last quarter. We clearly saw traffic and sales continue to strengthen in the second quarter as the combination of lower interest rates together with at least slower price appreciation and in some instances slightly lower prices have positively impacted affordability. And that together with low unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence, and economic growth drove the consumer to return to a more affordable housing market. And while the current market conditions would not be considered robust, they would be considered solid. We believe that the housing market is generally running in a performance channel that is bounded on the downside by the production deficit that has persisted for the past decade and has kept housing supply constrained, while it is somewhat moderated on the upside by rising land and labor costs as well as affordability limits. Within this channel the market is generally continuing to improve, and we believe, will continue to improve for the foreseeable future. Although we reported gross margins at the lower end of our previous guidance, this reflects the greater than expected incentives used during the market slowdown or pause to maintain volume ensure -- and ensure that we achieve our 2019 closing targets between 50,000 and 51,000 homes and we remain confident that we will achieve this target this year. We expect to see our margins improve steadily throughout the remainder of the year as prices remain stable and incentives continue to subside. Accordingly, we expect to generate strong cash flow for the remainder of 2019 and expect to continue to use excess cash flow to both pay down debt, while opportunistically repurchasing stock. We're well-positioned to thrive in this solid market condition. We've continued to refine our ramp strategies to position ourselves for strong performance and a strengthening balance sheet. Rick's going to update further -- this further in his remarks. And additionally we have noted -- as we've noted in prior calls, we continued to invest capital in technology initiatives that are redefining the future of both our company and our industry. We believe that our tech initiatives represent significant opportunity and upside for the company as we create efficiencies in internal operations, reduce our SG&A, and reduce our cost structure. In the second quarter, our SG&A continued its downward trend with our lowest second quarter level ever at 8.4%. We continue to be laser-focused on progress on our technology adoptions and change management, and this is being incrementally reflected in bottom line improvements, while we enhance our customer experience and our customer interface. We're still at the very beginnings of opportunities that we envisioned as we're going to build an ever better and more efficient mousetrap. Before I turn over to Rick, Jon, and Diane, let me just say that we remain encouraged by both Lennar's position and market conditions for the remainder of the year. Our size and scale in each of our strategic markets continues to manage -- to help us manage cost and production in a land and labor constrained market. Our focus on technology is driving efficiency that is reflected in our consistent improvement in SG&A. Our strong cash flow and bottom line profitability are continuing to enable us to reduce debt and repurchase shares. Our strong balance sheet continues to improve and position us for the future. And our strategy of shedding non-core assets continues to drive an intensified focus on our core homebuilding business. As the homebuilding market continues to solidify in the wake of the recent pause, we're optimistic about our ability to deliver strong and consistent performance for the remainder of 2019. And with that, let me turn over to the rest of the team. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks Stuart. In these recovering market conditions, our homebuilding operations executed at a high level and produced solid results. Homebuilding revenues for the second quarter totaled $5.2 billion, representing a 3% increase from 2018. This was driven by a 5% increase in deliveries to 12,729 homes and a 1% decrease in average sales price. Deliveries for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance as we were able to accelerate some third quarter closings into the second quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter totaled 20.1%, which was within the range of prior guidance and flat sequentially with our first quarter. As Stuart mentioned, our second quarter gross margin was impacted by an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers during the market pause in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our margin was also slightly impacted by an increase in the number of closings coming from third-party option contracts versus on land that we developed ourselves. This is in line with our land-lighter strategy that is focused on maximizing cash flow and our internal rates of return. Notwithstanding that our gross margins were down in the quarter, we expect our margins to increase in both Q3 and Q4 through a combination of reduced incentives and lower direct construction costs that Jon will talk about. Our SG&A in the quarter was 8.4%. This marks an all-time second quarter low and highlights the power of our increased local market scale and our operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings on the sale of homes totaled $603 million, up 48% from the prior year. Net earnings for the quarter totaled $421.5 million, up 36% from 2018. New orders for the quarter increased 1% to 14,518 homes, exceeding the high-end of our Q1 guidance. From a dollar value perspective, new orders totaled $5.8 billion, which was down 4% from the prior year, reflecting an increase in sales incentives, which I talk about a higher percentage of entry-level homes and a transition away from the higher-priced CalAtlantic homes in the year ago period. Our average sales price will continue to move lower going forward as many new entry-level communities come online. This is particularly the case in Texas, as all of our Texas markets in the last 18 months we bought over 75% of the land that's targeted to entry-level product. During the second quarter, we saw increased seasonal demand, which benefited from both lower mortgage rates and moderating sales price increases. Homebuyers' sentiment improved throughout the quarter and we experienced solid traffic on both our website and our Welcome Home Centers. While our rates helped drive demand, we continued to price to market and offer incentives although at reduced levels from the market pause to keep our homebuilding business on track to build and close more than 50,000 homes in 2019. We continue to believe that maintaining an even flow of steady production is the best operating strategy, as it will drive higher operating margins, IRRs and increase shareholder value. We ended the second quarter with a sales backlog of 19,061 homes with a total dollar value of $7.7 billion. This backlog combined with our current housing inventory puts us in a great position to achieve strong operating results in fiscal 2019. Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you a brief update on our land initiatives. The three strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter have continued to expand in both their initial markets and into new markets. In the last quarter, these ventures have put under contract or closed more than 11,000 homesites. Lennar will build on the majority of these homesites with selective sales to other builders to enhance the overall return in these ventures. As I said in the past, the majority of these homesites will be delivered to us fully developed on a rolling basis so just-in-time inventory. In the second quarter, we also announced another strategic transaction with Level Homes an Engquist Development in Raleigh, North Carolina. Through this transaction, we purchased 34 homes under construction and 29 developed homesites. More importantly, in continuing with our asset-light land strategy, we have a future right to purchase approximately 1,600 finished homesites across seven communities. These homesites will be delivered by Engquist over the next six years and this marks the beginning of a new strategic relationship in the Carolinas. Recognizing the continuing short supply of dwellings both for sale and for rent, we recently entered an agreement with one of our long-standing third-party relationships to build homes that will be purchased by that third-party in a stand-alone rental community. This community is in Florida and is the first in what we believe will be an ongoing business strategy and relationship where we build and sell homes in bulk on land owned by third parties with no lease-up risk. We are actively discussing this program with several landowners and investors that control large parcels of land suitable for single-family rentals in locations where we have a leading market share and we are the low-cost producer. We are optimistic that we can replicate this program, and that we can leverage our buying power and building expertise to achieve outside returns, and continue to lower our SG&A. We love this new business model as it will generate high IRRs, strong margins; leverage our existing overhead with no accompanying land risk. This is a perfect expansion of our land-light strategy. Now I'll turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks Rick. Today I'm going to give some color on the various cost factors that impact our cost of sales and the timing of how they flow through our deliveries. First, with respect to direct construction costs, there are several components impacting our direct costs. The positives are tailwinds that come from the drop in lumber prices, cost synergies and our production-first operating platform. The headwinds are cost pressures from the ongoing labor shortage in tariffs. While there are many variables that affect our direct cost, including the mix of homes closing in any particular quarter, as we look back at Q2 and look forward at the next few quarters we see that directionally our direct construction costs are decreasing. In the second quarter, the cost of materials, which account for 57% of our directs will lower sequentially by 0.5%. This is the first time in years that the cost of materials has dropped as lower-cost lumber and synergies flow through our closings. The biggest factor impacting material cost is lumber, which represents approximately 13% of direct cost. The peak pricing for lumber was back in June of 2018 at approximately $600 per thousand board feet. That pricing went into place for homes we started in July through September of 2018 and those homes deliver primarily in Q1 and Q2 of 2019. Lumber dropped to around $330 per thousand board feet in December of 2018. It then bounced back to $400 before trending to its low point earlier this month in June of $300 per thousand board feet. The December pricing will impact homes that started in January through March for Lennar, which will primarily be delivering in our third and fourth quarters. Deliveries in our second quarter will mostly start in October through December and priced off of September's lumber pricing of around $400 per thousand board feet. With respect to synergies, we remain on track to achieve our targets and are seeing those savings reflected in our cost of deliveries. Let me walk you through the timing of these synergies. Synergies were first layered in as negotiations with national vendors took place shortly after the merger in Q2 and Q3 of 2018. This was followed by negotiations with local trade partners, which resulted in new trade contracts for home starts in Q3 and Q4 through 2018. The transition of closing out CalAtlantic communities and the conversion of product to Lennar's more efficient Everything's Included platform takes place over a longer period of time. Once a new contract is established based on the negotiations for trades and new specifications and plan changes then new permits were required for the start of the new product to benefit from these lower cost. Homes benefiting from these production change strategy benefits have saving starting in our second quarter -- with homes delivering in our second quarter and a meaningful cohort of these plans we'll deliver in the second half of 2019. The severity of the labor shortage in the construction industry is the strongest headwind that we face. Labor cost represent 43% of our direct spend and were up 2.8% sequentially in the second quarter and 7.7% year-over-year. While labor cost continues to rise, I strongly believe our Builder of Choice focus has allowed Lennar to minimize the impact of labor -- of the labor shortage, especially in our ability to access labor for our jobsites. Another headwind is tariffs on material cost. Firstly, with the 10% tariff on Chinese goods that took place last September, and then another 15% this June. On average the impact to us is about $500 per home. We're in constant communication with our manufacturing partners, discussing strategies for offsetting impacts to these tariffs with alternate specifications and locations in manufacturing. The strategic relationships with our manufacturers just like with the rest of our trade partners is a result of the focus of our Builder of Choice program. We're seeing the benefits of this play out in real-time with discussions that develop solutions for avoiding cost increases, while improving safety, quality and cycle times despite the labor shortages. We consistently give advanced visibility to our trades for our production needs allowing them to plan accordingly. Maintaining an even flow start pace with our Everything's Included platform allows the trades to make better utilization of their limited labor. These efforts combined with our significant size and scale in each market enables Lennar to be the low-cost builder to serve. Lastly, another headwind affecting our cost of sales is land. Land cost as a percent of sales is increasing primarily due to two factors. As we've noted on previous calls, the land market remains constrained as entitlements are taking longer, restricting the availability of land in the market, which results in appreciating land cost. Additionally, as Rick mentioned, we're delivering a higher percentage of homes on option or just-in-time land. While this land delivers higher returns it comes at a cost premium, due to the low risk and short carry time associated with it. Overall, we remain focused on improving our net operating margin, free cash flow and return on capital. We're driven to simplify our operations enabling us to execute on our four pillars, our Builder of Choice production first operational program, our just-in-time selling platform driven by our dynamic pricing model, our technology-driven efficiency leverage overhead structure, and last our simple and efficient Everything's Included platform. With that, I'll now turn it over to Diane, who will give you more color on how these costs will result in our margin guidance for Q3 and Q4.
Diane Bessette: So thank you Jon, and good morning to everyone. So let me summarize and reemphasize a few points from our second quarter starting with homebuilding. So as we've mentioned looking at deliveries, deliveries increased 5% from the prior year and exceeded the upper range of March guidance by 6% as we benefited from both deliveries that were postponed by weather from our first quarter, and the recovering housing market. Our second quarter gross margin on home sales was 20.1%. The prior year's gross margin was 21.6% excluding CalAtlantic's purchase accounting. Q2 2019 gross margins were impacted by an increase in sales incentives offered during the homebuilding market pause and an increase in construction cost as a result of continued cost pressures due to land and labor shortages. Our second quarter SG&A was 8.4%, which is the lowest second quarter SG&A percent we have ever achieved. This compares to 8.7% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to continued operating leverage, evidenced through improvements in personnel and related expenses, and a decrease in broker commission's year-over-year. And then turning to new orders, new orders increased 1% from the prior year and additionally new orders exceeded the upper range of March guidance by 2%. Looking at absorptions, absorptions for the second quarter was 3.7 versus 3.6 in the prior year. Additionally, we ended the quarter with 1,325 active communities. And finally for homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories, we had a combined loss of $21 million compared to $17 million of earnings in the prior year. This was primarily due to a loss on consolidation of a previously unconsolidated entity, partially offset by our share of operating earnings from one of our unconsolidated entity. Then turning to Financial Services, looking at the results, the operating earnings net of non-controlling interest related to States Title were $62 million compared to $56 million in the prior year. And here is the detail of the components. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $43 million compared to – from $35 million in the prior year. As a result of the sale of our retail mortgage business in Q1 of 2019, total origination volumes decreased to $2.6 billion from $2.9 billion. The sale of the retail business however enabled the mortgage division to focus solely on the captive business, implement technology improvements, streamline processes and achieve G&A reductions that exceeded the impact from lower origination volumes. Title operating earnings were $13 million compared to $16 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the sale of the majority of our retail agency business and title insurance underwriter business to States Title in Q1 2019, which resulted in a decrease in retail closed orders. This decrease in retail volume was partially offset by an increase in captive closed orders and a decrease in G&A expenses, due to the sale. Rialto Mortgage Finance operating earnings were $6 million compared to $3 million in the prior year. The increase was due to higher securitization dollar volume during the quarter as compared to the prior year. And then turning to Multifamily, our Multifamily segment had an operating loss of $4 million compared to operating earnings of $15 million in the prior year. There were no sales in the quarter compared to two sales in the prior year that resulted in $17 million in gain for that segment. However, we had $4 million of promote revenue compared to – related to communities as Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund I compared to $5 million in the prior year. A few weeks ago, we announced the final closing of Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund II with the total of $1.3 billion of equity commitments including Lennar's commitment of $381 million. This success is a continuation of the build-to-hold platform that we have migrated to where we earn feed and promote, while creating value within our fund. And then finally, in the other category, as a reminder this category is for the legacy Rialto assets outside of Rialto Mortgage Finance and our strategic technology investments. Earnings were $2 million in the second quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Now turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $801 million of cash. At the end of the quarter, our homesites owned and controlled were 289,000 of which 215,000 are owned and 74,000 were controlled. Land acquisition spend during the quarter was $755 million and land development spend was $611 million. We had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $550 million, leaving $1.85 billion of available capacity. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 38.3% and during the quarter we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of approximately $52 million. Stockholders equity increased to $15.2 billion and our book value per share grew to $47.06 per share. And then subsequent to quarter end as Stuart mentioned, we retired $500 million of senior notes that were due in June. So then turning to guidance, I'd like to just give some guidance for the third quarter. Starting with homebuilding, we expect new orders between 12,500 and 12,800. We expect to deliver between 13,000 and 13,250 homes, which reflects the acceleration of home deliveries into Q2. We expect our Q3 average sales price to be between $385,000 and $390,000. We expect our Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 20.25% to 20.5% and our SG&A to be in the range of 8.3% to 8.4%. And for the combined homebuilding joint venture land sales and other categories we expect a Q3 loss of approximately $10 million to $15 million. And turning to our ancillary businesses, we believe our Financial Services earnings will be between $52 million and $55 million. We believe our Multifamily earnings will be about $5 million. And for the other category related to the Rialto legacy assets and our strategic investments, we expect Q3 earnings of approximately $3 million. We expect our corporate G&A to be about 1.7% of total revenue. And we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25.5% for the remainder of the year. The weighted average share count for Q3 should be approximately 321 million shares. And when you roll up all of those numbers, the guidance that we are expecting is an EPS range of $1.25 to $1.35. And now let me update guidance for the full fiscal year 2019. With regard to deliveries, we expect to deliver between 50,500 and 51,000 homes. We believe our average sales price will be about $400,000. Our gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Our SG&A should be in the range of 8.3% to 8.4% as we continue to benefit from operating leverage. Financial Services earnings should be in the range of $200 million to $205 million. Our Multifamily earnings should be in the range of $8 million to $10 million, and we expect corporate G&A to be in the range of 1.5% to 1.6% of total revenues. So in summary, we believe we are well positioned to have strong profitability and cash flow generation in 2019. And now, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per person. Our first question is coming from the line of Mike Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. First question, just on the housing market and some of the commentary that you gave earlier on in your prepared remarks, specifically talking about the housing market strengthening during the second quarter. You highlighted traffic and sales. And, I believe, even, if I heard you right, incentives declining, but I just wanted to get a little bit more granular in terms of the order trends, if possible. How they progressed during the quarter? Obviously, they came in a little bit above your guidance. And any commentary around June as well particularly as it relates to any possible early impact from the recent further decline in rates.
Stuart Miller: Yes. So, Mike, I think that, what we highlighted in the call is that the market had really continued the trend that we saw in the first quarter. There had been progressive improvements through the quarter, though fairly mild. And I was clear to say that, the market rather than being robust could be qualified as solid and it really did solidify through the quarter. And I think that's what you're seeing play through our numbers. Rick, you want to add to that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. And if I had to give you sort of trajectory in the quarter, May was the strongest month for us from both the new sales orders, from an absorption pace standpoint, and from just an overall field traffic and buyer sentiment. Incentives were down quite a bit from our fourth quarter with regard to the incentive in the sales order. And that's what gives us a little bit confidence that you'll start to see some margin improvement in the back half of the year combined with the construction cost up that Jon highlighted.
Mike Rehaut: That's great. Thank you Stuart and Rick on that. I guess, secondly, just to highlight your -- or talk a little bit more about the incentive trends. Specifically, the gross margins, you kind of highlighted that the increase -- if I heard it right, that the sequential increase in incentives on closings was still more of a flow-through from the softness in the fourth quarter. I wanted to be sure that that was fully the case. And that, as you're saying, maybe we could just shift the attention a little more towards, if you have any stats, around incentives on orders. And you've kind of been saying that they're down materially from the fourth quarter. I was curious on the cadence -- the continued cadence if there was any improvement in incentives on 2Q orders versus 1Q? So, I think, that's an area of focus right now as it relates to -- if the market continues to strengthen, as you talk about -- if the pricing has further improved 2Q versus 1Q?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. That's what I was trying to address. If you looked at the incentives in the new sales orders, not in the closed home, for Q4, that was about 6.1% in the fourth quarter. As we moved into Q1 and Q2, we saw additional improvement, Q1 was about 5.7%, Q2 was about 5.6%, but trending in the quarter down through the quarter of Q2.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. So the 5.7% and 5.6% were -- you're talking specifically on orders?
Rick Beckwitt: That's what you asked, yes.
Mike Rehaut: Perfect. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Truman Patterson: Hi. Good morning, everybody. This is actually Truman Patterson on for Stephen. Thanks for taking our questions. Just piggybacking off that last commentary with you guys saying that May was the strongest month of the year from, I believe, orders and absorptions and incentives. Do you guys believe that the lower interest rate environment has extended the spring selling season?
Stuart Miller: Well, I think, that's yet to be seen. We generally don't comment beyond the end of the quarter, but we definitely saw the market being fairly solid through the second quarter. And even as we've started to go into the third, it feels like the market is, as I said, solid. Lower interest rates clearly are impacting affordability. That's bringing people back to the market. And while new home sales are reported across the nation right now at down by about 7% or 8%, we're still looking at a generally solid economic environment with low unemployment and increasing wages basically getting customers to act on their appetite to find a home. We're in short supply relative to homes and interest rates is really enabling affordability to kick in and to bring buyers back to the market. So that's a trend that we've been seeing and that's kind of how we see things as we look through the end of the year, continuing to improve and solidify.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. And as I said in my remarks, the market is really following its typical seasonal pattern with improvement from the prior quarter periods. So I think it's too soon to tell whether it's going to be an elongated selling season because of mortgage rates being down. But what it has done is peak buyer interest, because things are more affordable right now.
Jonathan Jaffe: And this is Jon. I'll just add to that, if you think about it the second quarter of 2018, everyone thought that was a very strong market for new home sales and we surpassed that level in our second quarter of 2019. So again, direction talks about an improving marketplace. And there's no question as Stuart mentioned that the affordability impacted the lower interest rates is helping that.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thanks for that. I didn't hear a community count number. Could you guys just give us an update on community count growth? And last quarter you guys mentioned some weather-related catch up. I'm really just trying to get a sense of where you all think you could end the year and looking forward to some longer-term growth potential?
Diane Bessette: Yes. Steve. So we ended the quarter with 1,325 active communities. And if you look at where we think we'll be for Q3, we think it'll probably be flattish with the prior year. And if you look ahead as you get to the end of the year, we might be a little bit lower than the prior year just because we're accelerating our absorption pace.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you guys. And then anything kind of longer term, how you guys are thinking about community count growth?
Richard Beckwitt: Well we haven't really given projections into 2020, so I think that's a little bit premature right now.
Truman Patterson: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivy Zelman of Ivy & Associates. Your line is open.
Richard Beckwitt: Good morning.
Ivy Zelman: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. So I'm going to go for the bigger picture question given the fact that your stock is selling off and I think there's a big elephant in the room that no one's addressing, which is the fear of recession and the yield curve is certainly telling us that. So people say to me, why in the world would I want to own a homebuilding stock late in the cycle with the risk of recession around the corner after 10 years of economic recovery. And I think something you guys said today, sorry for the background noise was really interesting about your ability to sell homes to single-family rental operators. And one of the big concerns I hear about Lennar's specifically is that your factory of 50,000-plus units a year being the number three or higher in 25 markets, you actually have to continue to take a lot of risk in terms of exposure to land. And recognizing that if there is a downturn, you actually have more exposure than anybody else, because you have such a big machine to feed. So talk to us about in the downturn, if in fact a recession were to come to fruition, which I personally don't think is going to happen, but I'm not an economist and predicting recessions. But if in fact, how much of it for example of the single-family rental piece, whether it's Opendoor that's buying your homes or is -- or some of these guys that then sell it to a single-family rental operator. I think people are just very concerned about the risk of being involved in homebuilding sites this late in the cycle. And all of your size, even if you guys are doing an awesome job on scale, it's still a very capital-intensive business with obviously cyclicality risks. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Well there are a lot of embedded questions there Ivy and a lot of topic. And I think that we can all agree that there are crosscurrents in today's market. And there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic into -- this world quite positively. And there are some concerns that are out there, some of them are at the macro level and those are environmental programs that we're going to have to fit into. At the end of the day, our view is that the base of the economy is strong, unemployment's low. And relative to the housing market, you're really dealing in a world that we've not seen before. And that is for the past 10 years, you've really seen relative to the population of the country, a production deficit that has persisted. And that persistence means that housing is in short supply, is going to continue in short supply and there are going to be some movements in the market overall that are sometimes up, sometimes down. Affordability will be tested as we saw with the pause. But even with land short labor constrained prices or costs being pushed up, there's a need that is driving the housing market. And in our view and I've said this for some time, it presents somewhat of a floor for a downward limit on how constrained the market can get. And while the upside in the market is somewhat constrained as well, because of cost and affordability, there is a channel of production that it seems in order to fill the need for dwellings in the country, we're going to be traversing for quite some time. And if you look at a normalized level of production, and I know some people question it of around 1.5 million and maybe it's a little bit lower, we've been underperforming that for some time. Now what we've done is we've created some innovative land strategies and some innovative production strategies, recognizing that there will be a balance between what is sold and what is rented. And we're participating in both sides of that market in our rental program in our for-sale housing program that will in some instances be sold to groups that are buying and leasing. And we're really adopting a broad strategy of participating in all parts of the market as the country overall has to fill the need of dwellings that are in short supply.
Richard Beckwitt: I guess the other...
Diane Bessette: Well I think that's a -- go ahead Rick. Sorry.
Richard Beckwitt: I'd add -- Ivy is we benefit from being the low-cost producer. And while margins may move up or down depending on what goes on in the economy, we do know that we have an operating advantage. In addition to that, on this for-sale rental stuff, these are in areas that we wouldn't build, but for this type of program, because it's not a good for-sale market, it's more affordable markets where we found an opportunity to leverage our operating platform. As Stuart said, we are not seeing cracks in the system out there. We feel that the economy is moving along. And we're quite confident that if there is a downturn that we'll be able to react very proactively and slowdown the machine, but still have tremendous cash flow, because we won't have to buy as much land. So I think in an environment where the market goes down, we're really strategically positioned to outperform. Got to keep in mind that during the last downturn there were different issues at play. The biggest issue was that people couldn't afford to stay in their homes, because mortgage rates were much higher. We don't have that. And then past decline that's when a lot of inventory came to the market because people couldn't afford to live where they were living. That's not the case today.
Ivy Zelman: Well I think that's really helpful both of you. I think I'm just trying to be -- play devil's advocate, because I think your stock's the best recommendation that we have in our sector, it's our top pick. And what I see is just this hesitancy and concern. So what you just said Rick is that even if there was a downturn, the cash flow that you would generate do you -- I'm assuming you guys have modeled out what a recession not led by housing but let's just say trade wars or something that creates a recession what your sort of different sensitivities are. And I think it'd be helpful maybe not on this call, but I just think that's what the market's talking about today reminds me of when China was blowing up in first quarter 2016 and there's just a lot of fear and uncertainty. And you guys as a homebuilding company till you lived through a downturn maybe people stay away. And I think they're not doing themselves a service buying the stock here, but it'll be helpful for you guys to help even though you don't think Stuart there's going to be a recession, what happens to the company's earnings? What does it look like? What does the cash flow look like? I think that all will be really constructive for us to understand better.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Look we can add some color to that. But I think that we start with the understanding that our strategy is basically derived from that view of this channel and the downside protected and upside, kind of, limited moving through this middle zone. And remember as we said, as we went through the pause in the second half of 2018 we're focused on building through using pricing to basically maintain production, which maintains cash flow. And so as you think about the way that we would model a recession that is not housing led, and I think that it would not be but might be a derivative of trade wars or other things. It would be defined by those thoughts that the production deficit is a buffer, land and labor is a limiting factor and we're going to continue to produce homes at an accelerated level by using pricing to keep our production machine moving through.
Ivy Zelman: Great. Well, good luck guys. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is coming from the line of Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. Stuart, Rick, Jon if I can maybe follow-up here on that line of thinking. I think there's really no dispute about the -- some of the factors, which you've said can act as buffers to the industry as we go into the next downturn whenever that is. But by the same token, it's a little surprising to me that you would need -- that you wouldn't be seeing those same factors and then put together with lower rates, driving better pricing in the marketplace today without the need -- in other words it's surprising to me that you need to continue to have incentives. At the level that you're doing, I would have thought that your incentives would have been able to drop substantially sequentially from 1Q to 2Q in light of the lower rates and you've talked about the housing market having -- or your demand experiencing a typical seasonal pattern I think was your phrase. But rates have not been following a normal seasonal pattern this year. And so if I pull in my question with incentives, because you've been kind enough to give us this metric of 6.1%, 5.7%, 5.6%. Is that in your view keeping up with the market or are you leading the market with incentives? And if you could talk a little bit about why you think the incentive level that you're at has been necessary in light of the fact that the rates have dropped so much?
Jon Jaffe: Hey, Steve its Jon. I definitely characterize that as keeping up with the market. We are not of a scale nor is any other builder to make the market, and so you have a consumer that is looking at what value can they get for their monthly payment, which interest rates will have a big effect on, and creates a market pricing. We're participating in that market from community, community it may vary, might be more or less aggressive depending on that particular marketplace. But in general we're in the market and I think it's just a reflection of a long upcycle, but one that's defined as slow and steady, which in a lot of respects is more healthy than one that is very robust because that can't last very long. And so when this channel that Stuart described in my view is slow and steady, so there isn't robust demand that as you think about your question of normal seasonality why hasn't it been stronger and created a greater reduction incentive. It's really a reflection of marketplace that we've seen for the last few years just continuing forward at that pace.
Stuart Miller: Additionally, I would say that if the perception is that we’re using incentives to stimulate the market in a broader sense, the incentive structure is -- advice that at a very local level community-by-community in response to existing market condition. This in cooperation with Jon, Rick our division presidents and the people on the ground. So you're really looking at a composite incentive number that derives from what the local level is telling us that the market is requesting. So it's an active feedback rather than something that is forced downward to drive the market.
Jon Jaffe: Steve, let's also remember the incentives number would go to zero even in the best of markets where we are closing cost and cost of that nature. So the floor is sort of call it 3%-ish in terms of what the bottom in a really strong market would be.
Rick Beckwitt: I think, sort of, just to end this. We run the analytics and models to understand where we maximize returns and profitability based on pricing and pace. And we started this year saying that we were going to deliver a certain number, we knew what our fixed overhead and our operating cost were and we're driving towards a cash flow number and an earnings number. And we could certainly slow down production and push price, but that wouldn't produce a better result. So I think we're operating the company with the strategy that we entered the year and we are focused on one small piece of the puzzle and there's a big -- a lot of pieces around it.
Stephen Kim: Yeah, that's helpful and that is just one of the things that we look at where we look at, obviously, a lot and we try to look at as many things as you look at to the best of our ability. So in that vein going to land spend, I was a little surprised that your acquisition oriented land spend wasn't lower this quarter given a market environment that is solid but not robust and given an outlook for -- given the order situation being flattish year-on-year and community count going to be flat to may be even slightly down by the end of the year. I was a little surprised that your acquisition spend was I think it was about first half of this year it's about $1.5 billion, and I think in the back half of last year it was like $1.6 billion or so. I would have thought that the acquisition land spent would be declining as we go forward. So can you give us a sense for what we can expect from the acquisition oriented land spend, which obviously would tie into your cash flow outlook over the next couple of quarters?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. I'll let Diane talk about the go-forward number. But I think, you need to keep in mind Steve that the land spend in any quarter is not necessarily dollars that are at -- that just came together in an acquisition in that quarter. Some deals take years to come together in order to get to a point where all the entitlements are in place and we're ready to go. And a lot of the land that you're looking at that got acquired has been under contract for two or three years. So you can't look at a comparison between last quarter and the quarter before that to this because it's apples and oranges particularly since we're buying and contracting for a much larger business now than we were in the past.
Diane Bessette: Yes Steven, I think if you just look at the numbers, our second quarter was not too dissimilar from the first quarter, a little bit higher, but not materially and so I think we're clearly are in the second quarter is a good proxy for what you'll see in the third and fourth quarters as well.
Stephen Kim: Okay, great. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley of Barclays. Your line is open.
Matthew Bouley: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the guidance. You're guiding to I guess implying growing deliveries by double digits in the fourth quarter, but you're saying that -- or guiding to order growth of kind of low single digits in the third quarter. Obviously, the backlog is down a bit year-over-year in units. So, is there any additional color there perhaps around your internal star projections? What else could you say that gives kind of insight into reaching that fourth quarter delivery guidance in light of where orders and backlog are? Thank you.
Diane Bessette: Yes, I think if you look at our third quarter of guidance on delivery, you're absolutely right. We're sort of in the single-digit range and we see pickup as you go into the fourth quarter. We're generally back-end loaded. So I'm not sure that we're too dissimilar. If you look at the pattern of last year, pretty similar, we always pick up and have our strongest --new order and delivery growth in the fourth quarter. So I'm not sure that we're too out of sync with the typical pattern.
Matthew Bouley: Okay. Understood. And then secondly, the SG&A side, I think you've shown some pretty clear progress with the tech investments and streamlining all the costs. I think Stuart you termed it as a significant opportunity still going forward. So just any additional thoughts on kind of the longer term opportunity, broker commissions, advertising, what are the different buckets and how much runway is their on all that? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Yes. Look I've noted this before. I think that there is still a lot of opportunity throughout our SG&A levels to improve our business operation by using technologies and we're working with a number of really vibrant programs and a lot of them are customer facing. We've talked about Opendoor. Opendoor enabled homes or home sales for our company continue to accelerate. And the better we get at working with Opendoor, the more we're able to drive our cost down. And that's a benefit to our SG&A. But at the same time, we're working with companies like States Title to improve the amount of time that it takes to get a title policy and to deliver documentation to our customers. And in time, though not yet, that will improve some of our financial services performances. We're using Blend to help our customer better access, the mortgage application process. And across our platform, there is just a number of technology opportunities to refine the way we do business and bring cost down incrementally. It's not going to happen in large steps quarter by quarter, but what we've been seeing is 10 basis points here, 20 basis points there over the last quarter year. And over years, you're going to start to see us become a much, much more efficient business because technology has made us better at what we're doing.
Matthew Bouley: All right. I appreciate all the details. Thanks again.
Stuart Miller: Okay. You bet. Why don’t we take our last question?
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Your line is open.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask two questions about California, I'll just ask one question with both of parts in it. One, just can you talk a little Stuart about how California performed for you? And then, with the move towards more lot options and what looks like a pretty significant move to smaller homes quick returns, does that impact at all how you think about California in terms of land mix and community mix on a long-term basis? How that might influence your thought?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. I'll take your question. So California in general improved, but it's really two different categories to think about when you look at California. The high end coastal markets particularly the San Francisco Bay Area and Orange County are still a bit sluggish. Those are the higher price points, you're talking $1 million-plus homes and heavily influenced by what's being impacted with the Chinese buyer. So those we're going to call it for what it is those remain sluggish. The more eminent markets from the empire in the South in San Diego, up through the Central Valley and into Sacramento, those markets are all performing very well, very consistent with what Stuart described in terms of the overall market condition being solid. And we're seeing strength in market there much lower price points, say in the $400000 to $600000 price range is performing very well. With respect to land in California, we're well positioned. It's not a market that really lends itself to a lot of growing option developed program. It's mostly owned developed land, but we do have given our scale in the respective markets. We've got very strong strategic relationships where there are opportunities for phase takedowns for long-term relationships. We're in every one of those opportunities throughout the state and maximizing it. But you're not going to see the same kind of volume on just-in-time land inventory that you'll see in a Texas or Florida market that's the land position is more set up for delivering that.
Carl Reichardt: Okay. Thanks, Jon. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Okay. It sounds like we've come to an end. I want to thank everyone for joining us and we look forward to continuing to give guidance and understanding of our business as we go forward. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-03-27 11:00:00) =====

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great, thank you. Good morning everybody. This morning I am here with Rick Beckwitt our Chief Executive Officer; Diane Bessette our Chief Financial Officer; and of course David Collins, our Controller; Jon Jaffe, our President is joining by phone. I'm going to start with a brief overview. Rick and Jon will give a brief operational overview, and Diane will deliver further detail on our first quarter results as well as some additional guidance for 2019. As always when we get to Q&A, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin and say that, well, the housing market continued to be choppy throughout our first quarter, we are pleased to report very solid results. Although, we had slightly lower than expected deliveries and revenues, we achieved somewhat better than expected sales and margin as we did see strengthening as the quarter progressed. Generally speaking, it seems as though the market paused in the back half of '19, corrected in the first quarter and is now on solid footing, as we begin the 2019 spring selling season. Looking backward, the housing market continued to slow through the fourth quarter 2018 as higher home prices and rapid interest rate increases combined to create a mismatch between prices and buyer expectations. Through the first quarter, interest rates moderated and home price appreciation stalled and even pulled back. We clearly saw traffic and sales accelerate through the first quarter as strong employment, wage growth, higher participation rate, consumer confidence and economic growth drove the consumer to return to a more affordable housing market. Given this progression, we continue to believe as we said last quarter that the market took a natural pause, it has now adjusted and recalibrated, and we are optimistic that demand driven by fundamental economic strength will continue to accelerate through the spring selling season. We've noted consistently that the housing market is primarily driven by the deficit in housing production that has persisted for over a decade. This production deficit continues to define an overall shortage of housing in the country and has acted as a stabilizer as affordability has been tested. Supply of dwellings both for sale and for rent, continue to be short and underlying demand driven by the need for a place to live remain strong. Against that backdrop, Lennar performed well in choppy conditions while deliveries missed the low end of guidance by 2%. This small miss was simply a shift in timing attributable to well-documented unusual weather conditions around the country. New orders on the other hand exceeded the upper end of our guidance by 5%, driven by improving demand progressively through the month of the quarter. We achieved net earnings of almost $240 million this quarter and our strong cash position enables us to opportunistically repurchase another 1 million shares of stock and end up with a debt to total cap ratio of 38.5%, which is a 580 basis point improvement over last year. We expect to generate strong cash flow for the remainder of 2019 and expect to continue to use excess cash growth to both pay down debt while opportunistically repurchasing stock. Additionally, our significant technology initiatives around the Company continue to be a significant reservoir of opportunity as we enhance our customer interface, create efficiencies in internal operation, reduce our SG&A and reduce our cost structure as well. We continue to be laser focused on progress on our technology adoption and change management as this is being incrementally reflected in bottom line improvement. We're still at the very beginning of the opportunities that we envision as we build a better mousetrap. On a final note, we continue to focus on reverting to our core homebuilding platform by repositioning or opportunistically monetizing non-core assets and business lines in order to drive efficiencies and enhance cash flow. In the first quarter, we completed the sale of our real estate brokerage business as well as the sale of the majority of our retail title business and underwriter and our retail mortgage business. Additionally, we contracted to sell our hospital in the Midwest a remnant asset from Rialto and that asset is expected to close in the second quarter. Before I turn over to Rick, Jon and Diane, let me just say that even with what has been a choppy housing market, we are very excited about our position and our business strategy and we're encouraged by recent market signals about the remainder of the year. Of course, we benefit from the size and scale we have amassed in each of our strategic markets and that's reflected in our consistent improvement in SG&A. Through 2019, we'll be generating strong cash flow and bottom line profit, and we're continuing to use cash to reduce debt. Our balance sheet is strengthening while we use the weakness of markets to opportunistically repurchase shares. We are shedding non-core assets to generate additional cash and to partner with tech companies who can help enhance our customers experience while reducing overhead. As the homebuilding market continues to stabilize and redefine itself in the wake of the recent pause, we are optimistic about the remainder of 2019. While Diane will give further Q2 guidance and some additional general direction on our full year expectations, based on our existing land position, our operating strategy and our dynamic pricing model, we will reiterate that we fully expect to deliver between 50,000 and 51,000 homes in 2019 with increased efficiency, improving margins through the year and with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow. And with that, let me turn over to Rick.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. In spite of somewhat softer market conditions, we achieved strong top and bottom-line growth in the first quarter. Revenues for the first quarter totaled 3.9 billion, representing a 31% increase from 2018. This was largely driven by a 30% increase in deliveries to 8,802 homes and a 4.1% increase in average sales price. Deliveries for the quarter fell short of our Q4 guidance and were negatively affected by development and construction delays, driven by adverse weather conditions across the country. These deliveries will shift into our second quarter and some of our scheduled second quarter deliveries will shift into our third quarter. We expect to return to a more even flow production schedule with non-weather affected build times by the end of Q2. However, notwithstanding construction weather delay, the accelerated starts in Q1 and successfully got on track with our internal start projections cumulatively through the end of Q1. Our gross margin totaled 2.1, 20.1% in the first quarter. While this was on the lower side of our prior guidance it was consistent with our Q4 announced strategy to price our inventory to market and to keep our production machine going. We continue to believe that this is the right strategy and that higher operating margins and IRRs will increase shareholder value. Our SG&A in the quarter was 9.5%, this marks an all-time first quarter low and highlights the power of our increased local market scale and operating leverage. Homebuilding operating earnings on the sale of homes totaled 383 million in the quarter, up 48% from the prior year. Our operating margin increased 80 basis points year-over-year we're particularly proud of the fact that our core homebuilding earnings are growing at a much faster rate than revenues once again demonstrating our increased operating efficiency. Net earnings for the quarter totaled 240 million up 76% from 2018. New orders for the quarter totaled 10,463 homes exceeding the high-end of our Q4 guidance by 5%. Orders in the quarter were up 24% from the prior year with the dollar value of approximately 4.2 billion, representing a 23% increase. On a pro forma basis, new orders were down 4% from 2018 tied directly to a 4% decline in active communities from the prior year. The harsh weather in the quarter delayed many community openings, so we should be on track by the beginning of the third quarter with community count. As I mentioned last quarter, the combination of higher sales prices and mortgage rates moderated demand in our fourth quarter, leading to reduced traffic, lower absorptions and increased sales incentives. During our first quarter, we saw a reversal of these trends driven by significantly lower mortgage rates and lower sales prices and/or moderating sales price increases. These market changes spurred an increase in traffic on both our website and at our welcome home centers. We saw this activity come first through our digital marketing programs and on-site community traffic picked up quickly thereafter. The combined impact of this increased traffic led to sequential increases in new orders in each month of our first quarter, with improved year-over-year performance in each month. Most importantly, we experienced this sequential order growth in every one of our 37 homebuilding divisions. While some of this activity is clearly seasonal, we have seen a noticeable shift in homebuyer sentiment. In addition, while we did increase sales incentives in the first quarter by 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that we've reached an inflection point and that incentives will start to decline as we enter the heart of the spring selling season. In any case, we continue to price to market and use our dynamic pricing model to maximize price with the strategic focus on volume and higher operating margins over gross margins by themselves. We ended the first quarter with a sales backlog of 17,259 homes with a dollar value of $7.1 billion. This backlog combined with our current housing inventory puts us in a great position to achieve strong operating results in 2019. I'd like to briefly discuss the recent changes by FHA designed to tighten the underwriting standards on FHA originated loans. FHA now requires lenders to manually underwrite loans that have both debt-to-income ratios above 43% and FICO scores below 620 rather than rely on the automated underwriting system. This is a reversion to a policy that was in place from 2013 to 2016. While the loans can still be approved, the manual process takes slightly longer as it requires additional verifications, calculations and qualifying hurdles. The net impact of these changes to Lennar is insignificant. Based on our analysis of the loans that our Eagle Mortgage Company has made over the last five quarters we believe that less than 1% of our total loans would have been impacted by these changes. Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you a brief update on our land initiatives. The three strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter are up and running. Each vehicle is actively pursuing and underwriting new opportunities and moving forward with the entitlement and development of their previously existing portfolios. In addition, we have expanded the geographic territory of two of these existing structures to include markets outside of Florida. This expanded footprint will increase our asset light land strategy in many more of our homebuilding operations. Lastly, we are continuing to use these existing structures and are in advanced discussions with several regional developers and other markets to expand this program. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jonathan Jaffe: Thanks Rick. Today, I'm going to give an update on synergies, direct construction costs along with our production first operating platform and our SG&A leverage. First, we remain on track to achieve our prior guidance for 2019 of $380 million for merger synergies with 265 million of this from direct construction cost savings and 115 million from corporate and SG&A savings. Next, I want to give some perspective on what we are accomplishing with our production first focus, what many of you refer to as pace over price. We've discussed for several quarters our goal of becoming the builder of choice for the construction trades. We articulated a program where we would utilize our significant size and scale in each market to forge new working relationships with our trade partners. We've made the effort to work hand in hand with our trade partners to better understand how together we can maximize efficiencies that improve the bottom line profitability for our trade partners while lowering our construction costs and improving cycle time. Simply put, we've been on a mission to be the low cost preferred builder for the trades so they can in turn share these benefits back with us. We're beginning to see the anticipated results from these efforts sequentially for the first quarter over the fourth quarter. We had a very small increase of just 0.6% in our average construction cost per square foot. This is meaningful as the industry still faces a headwind of the ongoing labor crisis, which puts pressure on labor costs along with material cost pressures that comes from tariffs, factory labor shortages, stricter energy codes and all without the benefit of the lower lumber cost which will materialize later in the year. As we highlighted last quarter, we are focused on our production machine, delivering to the trades even slow starts and delivery throughout the year. We presented this plans to trades in all of our divisions and delivered on the plan on Q1 by guarding the homes we committed to. As Rick noted, we have to deal with some extreme wet weather conditions that interfered with the goal of evenly, spreading our production, but we still delivered on the commitments to start the homes we set to work. Many of our trade partners that we stood out and maintaining our start during fourth and first quarter while many of our peers pulled back on and start to sales slowed during this time. The combination of working with trade to strategic partners, our commitment to even slow production and simplicity of everything included, all work to create an environment with more and more trades are concluding at Lennar their builder of choice. With our combined size and scale we’re able to leverage our SG&A turn offline, first quarter low 9.5%. A big contributor to this improvement is our continued focus on the sales process which has reduced our average realtor commission down to 2.27% in Q1, an improvement of 26 basis points year-over-year and 12 basis points sequentially from Q4. This reduction in cost is a result of our efforts to reach our customers early in the process to our digital general marketing campaigns. We had over 190,000 total internet leads in Q1 a year-over-year increase of 32%. In internet leads someone who specifically requests the information from us. These leads are extended to immediately buy one of our internet sales consultants who are based in each one of our divisions. Their responsibility is to help the customers decide which community is right for them and then set an appointment for the customer to visit that community and follow up with the customer to remind there another appointment or to reschedule as needed. This produces a high quantity of high quality leads for our community-based new home consultants and on a scheduled appointment basis. I will conclude by noting the plan will improve our net operating margin, free cash flow and return on capital is proving now. Its execution is built on four pillars, one our builder choice production first operational platform which drives cost down. Two, our just in time selling platform driven by our dynamic pricing model which allows us to, obviously, price to current market conditions; three, a technology driven efficiently levered overhead structure; and four, our everything included platform that simplifies the homebuilding process while providing great value to the home buyer. I would now like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, John and good morning to everyone. So let me summarize and reemphasize a few two points from our first quarter and so starting with homebuilding. As you've heard looking at deliveries, our actual Q1 2019 deliveries increased 30% from the prior year Q1 2018 deliveries and decreased 12% from pro forma Q1 2018 deliveries. These pro forma deliveries included CalAtlantic December 2017 deliveries which was the last month of its fiscal year and does not truly comparable. Our first quarter gross margins on home sales was 20.1%, the prior year gross margin was 19.5% or 21.6% excluding CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. Our Q1 2019 gross margins were impacted by an increase in sales incentive consistent with our focus on pace and then increase in construction cost due to the high point of lumber prices in 2018 slowing through Q1 delivery. As you've heard us say, our first quarter SG&A was 9.5% compared to 9.7% in the prior year. The decrease was due to improved operating leverage as a result of increased size and scale as well as our continued focus on obtaining benefits from our technology initiatives as John detailed. And then turning to new orders, new orders increased 24% and new order dollar increases 22% for the first quarter primarily results of the CalAtlantic acquisition. Our Q1 2019, new order decreased 4% from pro forma Q1 2018, new orders, and committed accounts decreased at the same rate and that’s the drops in full flat year-over-year pro forma near at 2.7. Our Q1 cancelation rate was about 17%. And finally, the Q1 2019, homebuilding joint venture, land sales and other categories, we had a combine loss of $13.2 million compared to our $154.5 million earnings in the prior year. But remember that last year, included a gain of approximately $165 million related to the sale of an 80% interest in one of our homebuilding joint venture. And then turning to financial services, again as you've heard us say, consistent with our reversion to pure play homebuilder. During the first quarter, our financial services segment sold the majority of its retail title agency business and title insurer underwriter -- insurance underwriter, its retail mortgage business and its real estate brokerage business, but these transactions resulted in a net gain of approximately of $1.6 million. As a result of these strategic transactions, financial services headcount has been reduced from approximately 3,200 at year end to approximately 1,700 after the completion of these transactions. And then just to add a little more color on the largest transaction, which was a sale of our retail title agency business and title insurance underwriter. So, we sold the majority of these operations to States Title as we previously announced. In connections with this transaction, we provided seller financing and received substantial minority equity ownership State in States Title. Combination of both the equity and debt components of their transaction did not meet the accounting requirement of sales treatment and therefore, as you look at our number you'll see that we will require to consolidate States Title results at this time. So then looking at the components of financial services operating earnings net of, not at net of non-control measures related to States Title combined with $21.8 million compared to $25.9 million in the prior year and the detail of the component are as follows. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $40.9 million from $14.5 million in the prior year. Total originations were relatively flat at $1.9 billion for both Q1 2019 and Q1 2018. Originations in Q1 2019 included increased volume related to a full quarter of CalAtlantic offset by a decline in volumes due to the sale of the retail business. Title operating earnings increase to $5.9 million from $5.4 million in the prior year. Even though, there was a decrease in the number of Title transactions due to the business is sold, operating earnings increased as a result of additional transactions related a full quarter of CalAtlantic and a focus of cost reductions to right size the business. And then, one point to note regarding financial services, in connection with Rialto investment and asset management platform sale in the fourth quarter of 2018. Rialto mortgage finance or RMF has moved into our financial services segment, and as such, our prior period information has been adjusted to confirm with the current presentation. And so looking at our RMF, for the first quarter of 2019, their operating earnings were about break even compared to 6.5 million in the prior year. This decrease was due to lower securitization volume and margins during the quarter, as compared to the prior year. And then looking at Multifamily, in the first quarter our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of 6.8 million compared to an operating loss of 1.2 million in the prior year. In this first quarter, we recorded 15.5 million related to sales during the quarter and 1.8 million of promote revenue related to the stabilization of properties in our LMV fund. As we've noted for a while, we have been moving from a build-to-sell to a build-to-hold platform, earnings fees and promote by creating value within our fund. And then finally, other just a small note, you'll see that new category on our balance sheet and P&L. So, as a reminder, we've combined with the remaining Rialto assets, which are primarily the fund investments and our strategic technology investments into this category effective December 1st, earnings of 3 million in Q1, 2019 compared to 4 million in the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, at February 28, we ended the quarter with 853 million of cash. We had borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 725 million, moving about 1.5 billion of the available capacity. At quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 38.5%. And during the quarter as Stuart mentioned, we repurchased 1 million shares for a total of approximately 47 million. At the end of the quarter, our home sites owned and controlled were 278,000 of which 210,000 are owned and 68,000 are controlled. And stockholders' equity increased to 14.8 billion and our book value per share, grew to 45.75 per share. So now turning to guidance, I'd like to provide some guidance for the second quarter. Starting with homebuilding, we expect new orders between 14,000 and 14,300. We expect to deliver between 11,700 and 12,000 homes. We expect our Q2 average sales price to be between 400,000 and 405,000. We expect our Q2 gross margins to be in the range of 20% to 20.5%, and our SG&A to be in the range of 8.5% to 8.6%. And for the combined category of homebuilding joint ventures, land sales and other we expect a Q2 loss of approximately 10 million to 15 million. And then turning to our ancillary businesses, we believe our financial services earnings will be between 45 million and 47 million. We believe our Multifamily earnings will be about a $5 million loss. And for the other category related to the Rialto legacy assets and our strategic investments, we expect a Q2 loss of approximately 10 million. We expect our Q2 corporate G&A to be about 1.6 of total revenue and our tax rate to be about 25.5%. Our share count should be about 321 million shares. This guidance should produce an EPS range of dollars $1.7 to $1.20 for the quarter. And then turning to fiscal 2019, given that we believe the market is a bit less uncertain and on more solid ground, we thought it would be helpful to provide a few additional data points for the full year 2019. This guidance is still preliminary and we will adjust as the year progresses. So starting with delivery, we expect as Stuart mentioned to deliver between 50,000 and 51,000 homes. We believe our average sales price will remain relatively flat from current level, so approximately 400,000 to 405,000. Our gross margin is expected to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, and our SG&A in the range of 8.3% to 8.5%. And then finally, a couple of comments regarding our ancillary businesses, financial services earnings should be in the range of 185 million to 190 million, and then our Multifamily earnings should be in the range of 5 million to 10 million. This reflects our migration from a build-to-sell to a delta of full platform. Strategic change means that instead of having GAAP earnings as we sell assets, we will have additional accumulation of profit that will be recognized in the future as assets are completed and stabilized. The estimate of our shares accumulated changes in fair value is approximately a 150 million on 21completed and stabilized assets in our LNV Fund I, as we compare the market value of our investment to our basis, as additional assets complete and stabilize, this amount should increase. So in summary, we believe we are well positioned to have strong profitability and cash flow generation in 2019, and we look forward to reporting our progress in future quarters. And so with that, I would like to turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Buck Horne: Just could you start with walking us through the map and just characterize what you're seeing in terms of demand trend and absorption phases geographically? And maybe by price point and just any other factors with certain markets for example foreign buyers in California as an example? Any color there would be helpful.
Jonathan Jaffe: And particularly in California, we saw in the first quarter the same pattern Rick described nationally, which was each month sequentially we've saw an improvement in traffic and the quality of that traffic and in sales. And we saw, what we expected which should be a recovery for us in the more affordable California markets of the Central Valley and Sacramento, and a slightly slower recovery in the more expensive coastal market Bay Area, Orange County and San Diego.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, this is Rick. As I said in my comments, we saw sequential increases each month, each quarter by in every division that we have. From that an overall standpoint, we started in the December month with a negative comparison year-over-year, and got finally to in February a positive variance that netted to our 4% down for the quarter. You saw increases in absorption pace months-to-months in months throughout the quarter, and that was pretty much across every market that we saw.
Jonathan Jaffe: So, it sounds like the trends in the margins or the margins in the backlog are stabilizing and/or improving. I'm just wondering, is that a function of any changes in the product mix you're making? Or is that the expectation of reduced incentives going forward that would affect the rest of 2019? And are there other tailwinds in the margins that whether it’s lumber, labor or production synergies you could quantify.
Richard Beckwitt: So, I will start out with the backlog and Diane’s guidance with regard to Q2. The sales that we generated in the first quarter and some of the sales that we generated in the fourth quarter that will close in our second quarter are affected by some of the incentives that we use to move our inventory. As we said, we are focused on our production model and really geared towards net operating margins, but some of those sales will have a higher incentive in them and as a result have a lower gross margin. As we look through the year, we’re optimistic that will be able to get to a point where we have to offer less incentives to keep that production pace up. We’re just beginning the heart of sales season now and we will have to see how the year goes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Stephen Kim: Good job in a tough environment. Wanted to ask you, Stuart, about your overall comment about the industry taking a natural pause last year, I mean I just want to make sure that when we get your perspective clearly, now that last year sort of in the record books and we sort of gotten back to a little bit of a normalized environment, because obviously rates are continuing to be little bit jumpy. So, when we look at the decline in demand that occurred last year in the back half really beginning in the middle of the year, I think you’re characterizing it now than the industry taking a natural pause. But you didn't specifically call out the mortgage rates sort of moving north to 4.5%, but I think a lot of people sort of keyed in on that because 4.5% mortgage rate was a little lower than I think most people's thought would be the threshold above which demand would take a pause. And so, as we go forward here with last year in the record books, do you believe that 4.5% represents an important threshold or do you believe that because we now have another year of economic growth that maybe a threshold that might be in line which should be like a 5% mortgage rate. Just want to get your sense of the interplay the mortgage rates in your generalized outlook for what happened last year -- I’m sorry your reflection on what’s happened last year and what you think will happen as we go forward over the next couple of years.
Stuart Miller: So, let me go back to my comments, Steve, and highlight that both last quarter and this quarter, I have talked about this natural pause in terms of two components. An accelerated rate of increase in ASP which we have seen for a number of quarters together with a very rapid increase in interest rates, and the reason I articulated it last quarter and even in the third quarter, as the beginning to the natural pause at that time is the rate at which sales prices had been moving up was outside of a normal rate. And when you layered on top of that a very quick sticker shock approach to interest rates moving up, it just created a miss match between buyers need and buyers expectation, and I felt that it was a natural sticker shock that came from the rapidity with which rates and ASP were moving. So when I think about things today, we've seen moderation on both fronts as articulated, both on the price depreciation, we have seen price depreciation, certainly slow down. I said I used the word stall and even pull back in my comments. And we have seen that in various markets we have seen, price depreciation really pull back quite a bit in response to demand subsiding. But additionally layering on top of that we've seen a serious reduction in interest rates. And the combination of the two has really brought the market back kind of into what I think of as equilibrium. The economy has continued to be fairly strong. Unemployment has been low. We've seen wages increasing. We've seen participation rate increasing and that reflects itself in more dual income families. And so these are the things that we’re seeing at our welcome home centers, as people come to visit with us, that interest rates together with average sales price, together with general economy moving in the right direction has really set a stage of stability right now in terms of the market moving forward. Now against that back drop, remember that home production, the production deficit that I keep referencing, we still haven't seen home production yet to what most people still think is a normalized 1.5 million homes per year. We have been decidedly well below that number for a very long period of time. And so, we still have a housing shortage, people need a place to live, affordability has been tested, that affordability test has been pulled back. And so, we kind of look forward and think that the market looks pretty good.  As to your question about 4.5% rate is that some kind of an inflection point, I think it has more to do with the rapidity at which rate, interest rate moves together with average sales price alongside of an improving economy. And I think that what we saw in the third quarter and fourth quarter was it just happened too quickly and created sticker shock.
Richard Beckwitt: And Steve, just one another point on that, as we said in Q4, we didn't see a qualification issue with regard to people when they locked in at the home they could afford. And it was just really a mismatch between buyer expectation and what products they could buy. And now, that has been reset and so I'd like rebooting a computer. And that's why, Stuart, gotten to the point where we got positive were back in action here.
Stephen Kim: Talking about the rapidity with which ASPs are increasing. Obviously, you've got to make shift that's been going on as you can target anymore affordable price points and all that, which has been absolutely the right move. But one other thing to be part is that the ASP at the entry level is in many cases has been over the last couple of years growing at two to even three times the rate of the market overall. And so that sort of hidden there and that sort of ASP mix blended mix. And so, I was curious as to when you talk about ASP the thing that you are envisioning in an environment where ASP growth is going to be a little bit more moderate, little bit more sustained -- at a sustainable level. Did you -- when you’re talking about, are you talking about slowdown in the pace of ASP growth at the entry level as well? And then as a back half of that question -- you talked about the FHA. My question on the FHA is, were you surprised at the timing of the move -- were you surprised that they made that move the way they did when they did or did you expect that? 
Stuart Miller: Well, let me start with the ASP question and by the way we're noting that you squeezed two questions into one. So as it relates to ASP, ASP's have been moving up in part because of short supply and in part because the cost structures have been moving up as we've seen that even more at the lower end. It's very difficult to produce affordable housing at lower prices, given land costs and production costs. But there has been a pause in ASP at all price points that was generated by both interest rates and an accelerated increase in price. And I think this is exactly why you've seen us shift and focus so dramatically to size and scale in local market, using size and scale to recalibrate both our building partner program, our Builder of Choice program to moderate the acceleration of construction costs and as well our laser focus on technology and recalibrating our SG&A because we recognize that affordability is going to be tested if prices keep getting driven up by the cost structure and we've got to do some things to offset that. And we've working really hard at that. So I think you're seeing that prices are going to have some caps to them defined by affordability and the challenge for the building community is going to be the rationalized cost both at the SG&A level and the cost structure level to accommodate what is likely to be slower price increases. And you’ve seen that yesterday in Case-Shiller the acceleration of price increases is lower and I think that that’s a little bit behind the curve, we’re still going to see that come down. I think that’s going to be more the wave of the future. And as it relates to FHA, I’m going to let Rick go ahead and hit that. 
Richard Beckwitt: We weren’t particularly surprised with the timing or the announcement. This has been something that’s been rumbling for a while. And -- but, as I said the net impact to us is de minimis. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. 
Michael Eisen: Actually, Mike Eisen on for Mike Dahl. Just wanted to follow up on some those comments that you guys have made a few times now about pricing resets or more moderating pricing environment. And I was hoping you would talk to for Lennar products specifically. What you guys are doing from a strategy standpoint whether it be taking down base prices, whether it be smaller square footage and how you guys are addressing this and then how -- where specific regions you are seeing the most success with this strategy? 
Richard Beckwitt: Jon you want to start off?
Jonathan Jaffe: Sure. For the most part we -- this was the very market-by-market approach that Lennar takes with this product. So we will have some markets where we have taken square footage down San Antonio, Texas, as an example, and we will have other markets where the land basis really doesn’t allow for that to happen on the other end of the extreme in Orange County, California, where square footage hasn’t reduced and price points remain at a higher overall level. Our big focus, as you've heard from all three of us, has been on how do we really moderate our cost structure, so that at whatever price we're trying to target whether it’s entry level first time move up, second time move up buyer, we can be price affordably in the marketplace against the competition, against the resale market as a value to that consumer. So laser focused on efficient production program to really keep the price points down recognizing that affordability at each price point is an issue and we got to be very responsive to that.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, so just to get to the second point -- portion of your question with regard to product adjustments, we are very laser focused on what features we should include in our Everything's Included product to capture the best value and provide the best -- best margin for us and provide the best value for our customers. So we look at footprints, we look at included features, we make adjustments, we have regional opportunities going on right now. So we're very focused on that. From a footprint basis in parts of Texas and some of the Carolinas you’ll see that we're starting to deliver a little bit smaller home. And if you look at just general pricing, on our sales for the last quarter, we were flat year-over-year with regard to ASP, some of that is mix, but some of that is just lower prices on a year-over-year basis. Our backlog year-over-year is down about -- average price and backlog is down about 6%. So that gives you a true look at some of the pricing adjustments that we have made. But as Jon and Diane said, shouldn’t really impact our margin going forward.
Jonathan Jaffe: Just to follow up on the point that Rick made, Everything's Included platform really allows us to deliver a better value to the customer because they're getting more included features without having to pay extra for it. A good example of that I was just chatting this morning with our folks in Indianapolis, through the regional president, and there they've gone from a complete CalAtlantic division and our presence there to converting their product to Everything's Included. And what they are finding is, with the offering -- the value offering of Everything’s Included their sales pace is picking up in the same communities with the same product, so that product offered at lower price, more value features included and no options available to the customer. So that allows us also address the issue of affordability.
Michael Eisen: Got it, appreciate all the color there, very helpful. And then just following up taking some of those comments and applying them to the impact on gross margins down the road, it seems that there's a few different buckets between the synergies, cost savings, lower lumber that are working in your favor offset by lower pricing, and just the desire to be higher velocity. So can you help us think longer term as you guys are operating this higher volume business model? How we can think about margins moving back higher -- some of the higher levels we've seen over the last few years or if this 20.5% to 21% is a new normal for what the company can do? Thanks and good luck.
Richard Beckwitt: Well, maybe I'll take a crack at it. I think we’re one of the only companies right now -- the only company that’s given full year guidance. And we really do not like to get over our SKUs and get into years outside of the current fiscal year.
Stuart Miller : So let me add to that and say, with that said, while we’re taking a conservative look forward as we look at the rest of this year recognizing that we’re coming out of the choppy market, we will wait and see exactly how this spring selling season shapes up. We haven’t just taken pricing as it’s come. Remember that we have spent a lot of time focusing on our cost structure using the tools that we've acquired through size and scale and through various technologies to really recalibrate our cost structure and to recalibrate our SG&A. And while the progress is incremental, and some times a little bit slower than we’d like, it is always with regard to our focus on the net margin that we see -- we’re driving all of our internal strategies. So when you listen to Jon talk about the cost structure and Builder of Choice initiatives and things like that these are all focused on generating a higher gross margin. When you hear me talk about our building a better mousetrap and generating lower SG&A and recalibrating our internal mechanisms and our customer interface, it’s all about generating a lower or a higher net margin, lower SG&A. So while we recognize that the market might be choppy, might be a little up, might be a little bit down and as we think ahead, we know some of these initiatives will produce results that might be slower than expected, we can't predict them exactly but we're focused on both the cost side of the business as well as what the pricing might be. Next question?
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman Associates. Your line is now open. 
Alan Ratner : Nice quarter and thanks for all the color here, great to hear about the improvement in the market. First question on the 2Q guide, if I heard it correctly on the orders, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more. It seems like you expect orders to still be down a little bit year-over-year which given the momentum you saw through the quarter and slipping to positive in February would seem a little bit surprising. So can you just talk a little bit more about what’s going into that, is that a function of the weather delays you experienced and kind of how do you see that playing out?
Richard Beckwitt: Jon, let me start off. Some of that is just a function of we’ve got a bunch of communities closing out this quarter and we have communities that will get back on track, but it is really late in the quarter. So you’re seeing a reflection of the number of sales opportunities we have for community count. And Jon, I’ll further to you now. 
Jonathan Jaffe: Just that I would make the same point. As you look at, for us projected sales pace for Q2 of ‘19 is actually right on top of the sales pace that we had in Q2 of ‘18. So it’s just community count that’s driving the result that you’re highlighting but we feel very good about our position given that we’re projecting a sales pace that’s equivalent with last year. 
Alan Ratner : So then just to hit the year-end or the full year target then, it seem like a pretty healthy ramp in the back half of the year. Can you just talk a little bit about what your starts growth looks like to support that level of growth?
Jonathan Jaffe: We have a natural increase as we moved through the year. We’re, as I mentioned and we all mentioned, trying to level that out throughout the year but we still haven't increased in starts as we move from first quarter to second, into third, so our second and third quarter are our largest for starts. Third and fourth will still be our largest for deliveries, but even this year that's beginning to moderate up compared to prior years.
Alan Ratner : Got it, okay. And if I could just add a second one, a separate topic, the iBuyer your Opendoor investment, curious maybe Stuart if you can give us an update on how that's been progressing, in how many markets is that kind of being active in right now and what percentage of your orders is the buyer actually utilizing that on their resale? 
Stuart Miller: So first of all, we're really enthusiastic about our program with Opendoor, first of all Opendoor has just tremendous management team that has a very aggressive agenda in rolling out -- not only rolling out to new markets, but more importantly refining their business model, focusing on both their customer interface and their use in the economics. And this is a team that is just best in class. Jon Jaffe has the privilege of serving on the Board there. And what we have is -- and I'll let Jon talk a little bit more about it in a second, but what we have is a rollout program where as Opendoor enters each new market we have a side-by-side launch with them of an Opendoor program within our division. And what we have done is we've really mapped out a change management adoption program to include the Opendoor tool in our toolbox whereas we have customers who come to visit us and say, “Jeez, I love your offering but I have a home to sell.” We can turn to them and say “We have a solution.” And that mechanism for rethinking the way that we work with our customers in taking the friction out of the trade up and the move up programs that we have in our system is really working well.  Opendoor on its own in, its own world is doing quite well but in coordination with Lennar we're finding greater and greater and accelerated adoption of the program as we go market-by-market. I have to admit I’ve lost track of exactly how many markets they are in together with us right now but we are monitoring market-by-market month-by-month how many Opendoor enabled sales we are achieving and we're really enthusiastic about the program. Jon? 
Jonathan Jaffe: Just yesterday we opened our 18th market with Opendoor in Austin, Texas. And as Stuart noted, it's been a great learning process as we have jointly with Opendoor, presented to our operating division, to our sales team the Opendoor platform. Our divisions eagerly await the opening of that in their market and we're finding lessons learned in process towards each opening, execution is better and better than the prior one. We have some of our first division has reached a activity level of 20 transactions a month, that's in Phoenix, and we're seeing as I said just better and better execution. So we're very excited about that. We view it as incremental buyers. It reduces our cancellation rate as it’s a solution to our buyers that have home to sell and it also helps lower our growth spend that buyer very often will reach earlier in the process and they don’t have a broker yet, so they are not involved in the equation. So as Stuart said, we’re extremely enthusiastic about the program. We got a great working relationship with the management team there. We are working hand-in-hand to learn from each other. We learn technology from them, they learn operations and real estate from us, and we’re both improving from that. 
Stuart Miller : Let me add one more point here since you've open the door on Opendoor, maybe the most important thing that we are learning, and this is where we are working around the clock is we are learning about change management, change management from the way things have worked and worked quite well to a progressively better way to interact with our customer and pull friction out of our program and migrate our associates to understand that there is a better way to transact. And that change management process has friction points of its own. We are learning as we are doing and we are evolving our ability to communicate internally and that something is perhaps one of the most exciting parts of the program. We're going to get better and better at this, not just with Opendoor but with Blend, with States Title and with others that we are engaged with, with Hippo. Our technology initiatives are -- we have a great deal of enthusiasm for them but our ability to integrate and work with them is getting better and better all the time. Last question?
Operator: Our last question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut : I have just one question in 27 parts, just kidding obviously. First question just on incentives. I was hoping to get a better sense, you talked about the market being choppy in -- throughout the quarter, but at the same time improving as mortgage rates perhaps and other -- the spring selling season progressed. I was wondering how that’s related to incentives as they progressed throughout the quarter and in particular what you saw across parts of California?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, throughout the quarter as I said, we continue to incentivize in order to move our completed product. And this is something we're going to continue to do in each period as we priced our inventory to market using our dynamic pricing model. We believe that as we moved into Q2 and to Q3 the level of incentives is going to start to dissipate, and we’ve started to see that through conversations that we've had with homeowners as we moved through the quarter. 
Jonathan Jaffe: And with respect to California, Michael, we definitely are consistent with what I said earlier in the more affordable market Central Valley, Sacramento, the incentives are proportionally lower than they are on the coastal markets, and then all those markets, particularly the central markets, we did see lessening incentives towards the end of the first quarter and the coastal markets, let’s say, just as Rick was saying that we use those incentives to generate the sales pace improvement in those markets. 
Michael Rehaut : Okay. Now thank you for that. I guess secondly, just shifting gears a little bit to return on equity. You've obviously highlighted some of the initiatives that you are doing in terms of returning to your core business, selling off some different businesses as you highlighted with different parts of the brokerage and title et cetera. How do you see over the next two or three years, where do you want to be in terms total assets sales or as it relates to kind of slimming down your balance sheet let's say, as well as share repurchase because when you look at ROE and that has had a pretty powerful relationship between that metric and valuation multiples. And with your ROE being below some of your larger cap peers, where do you want to see that metric go and what you are willing to do in terms of again additional asset sales or more aggressive share repurchase for instance to get there? 
Stuart Miller : So, we are very focused on return on equity and Jon -- and I -- let me just say I think we’re going to try to get one more question in the call. But I think that a combination of generating strong earnings and that strong earnings power coming from in part what we're doing relative to our SG&A is going to be a primary driver of stronger ROE. As we've an opportunity to continue to pare down ancillary businesses, as we've said, we're going to do that but we are not going to force the issue. We think that there are intrinsic values to the assets that we have, whether it’s LMV multi-family program or whether it’s FivePoint. So we're not going to force the issue as we haven’t with Rialto. But we're going to migrate to a core business strategy, that’s where are focus is going to be. And we are certainly going to be focused on using technology, those internal initiative and external to increase bottom line. Let's go to one more question. Operator? 
Operator: Yes, we do have a few questions in the queue.
Stuart Miller: Let's take one more.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. 
Stephen East: Thank you for squeezing me in there Stuart. First you got this big combined company. You all have talked now about the developer agreements and starting to get them off the ground some. Could you talk about maybe, first of all what geographies are you in if you are willing to talk about that yet? And then as you look at your ability to option more land at a faster pace maybe -- or can you all talk a little bit about where you are with that process and how fast you think you can accelerate your optioning of land asset? 
Richard Beckwitt: So it’s Rick, Stephen. As I mentioned last quarter, the deals that we brought into place, the three deals catapulted us to about a 30% control position and we expect that over the next 18 months will be north of 40% based on the arrangements that we’ve got in place. This is -- it’s a program -- just sort of getting back to that last question, what’s the biggest mover with regard to where we can enhance our return on equity, it’s moving to an asset light program that Stuart really identified our pivot going back two or three years ago. So we are going to continue this on. You will see a higher concentration of deliveries coming from vehicles like this. And as I said last quarter given the type of arrangement that we have in our right to purchase from these things without a contract, you may not necessarily see them directly in our controlled owned count because of the way that they are structured. And as far as the markets, we’ve expanded them to other parts of the Southeast. Let’s just leave it there. 
Stephen East: Alright, fair enough. And then on your community growth, a more immediate question and a bigger picture question. When will you turn positive you think in your community growth this year? And then as you think about your business in a broader sense, how fast would you all be satisfied growing your communities and really your unit growth if you will, just a big picture question? 
Richard Beckwitt: Yes. So really by the time we get into Q3, first month of Q3 you'll start to see a flat year-over-year community count. We had a double whammy come in this last quarter. We had a bunch of communities closing out where just because we had a good programs going on with regard to sales activity and we had about 30 communities that were delayed because of the weather did get us going. So we will start to see a more normalized year-over-year comparison as we get into Q3. And as we said, we plan to grow community count as we move forward in the market.
Stephen East: So from a bigger picture, where would you be comfortable and how do you think about your unit growth over time?
Richard Beckwitt: As we’ve said in the past, we think that we want to grow our business about a minimum of 3% to 5% to 7% with regard to unit activity. Some of that will be associated with a little bit higher absorption since the market recovers on a community-by-community basis but some of that is going to be tied to incremental community growth. But really our zip code is 5% to7% for the next year or a year or two. 
Stuart Miller : Okay, we’re going to wrap it up there. I want to say that I appreciate everybody joining and let me just circle back to where we started and that is we highlighted that we felt that the home building market had entered a pause in third and fourth quarter. We found evidence of stabilization in the first as we migrated to our first quarter. We look forward to checking back and giving an update on how we’re going from here. But with that said, we are optimistic that the housing market has found a firm ground and is ready to move forward. Thank you for joining. We’ll speak to you next quarter. 
Operator: That concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Great, thank you, and thank you Alex. And this morning I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffe, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer; Jeff McCall, our Senior Vice President, and of course, David Collins, our Controller. I'm going to start with a general strategic overview. Rick and Jon will give a land-and-operational overview, and Diane will deliver further detail on our fourth quarter numbers as well as some preliminary guidance on our first quarter of 2019. As noted in our press release, we will forgo further detailed guidance at this time. As always, when we get to Q&A, we'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up so we can accommodate as many as possible.  So let me go ahead and begin by saying that given the slower housing market conditions we continued to see in the fourth quarter, we're very pleased to report strong results. While sales and deliveries were somewhat off-target in the quarter, our bottom line and cash generation were strong and we continue to execute on our long-term strategy of selling noncore assets, strengthening our balance sheet and focusing on our core homebuilding business. Overall, the housing market continued to slow through the fourth quarter of 2018 as higher home prices and rapid interest rate increases combined to create a mismatch between prices and buyer expectations. As we entered the seasonally slower fourth quarter, purchasers remained on the sidelines awaiting the market to adjust. Sales rates were slower than expected and increased incentives were needed to adjust pricing to entice a reticent market to transact.  Over the past quarter, market data has clearly indicated that the housing market and recovery has decelerated and seems to indicate a continued slower market ahead. Generally speaking, the increases in new and existing home prices over the past years together with the rapid increase in interest rate, have caused a pause in the housing market and precipitated some price compression. Additionally, labor shortages, trade-driven material price increases and limited approved land availability have maintained upward pressure on cost. With recent pressure on both volume and margin, many have become concerned that the housing market has completely stalled. We still do not agree. As rates have started to ease, we've seen traffic pickup. Therefore, we continue to believe the market has taken a natural pause. It will adjust and recalibrate, and demand driven by fundamental economic strength will resume.  We still believe that the housing market is primarily driven by the deficit in housing production that has persisted for over a decade. This production deficit defines an overall housing shortage in the country. Supply of dwellings, both for sale and for rent, continue to be short and underlying demand remained strong though perhaps lower in the short term as the market adjusts to prices and interest rates. While we clearly saw traffic moderate and sales slow during the fourth quarter, with inventories low, we believe this is a temporary adjustment as strong employment, wage growth, consumer confidence and economic growth drive the consumer to catch up. Against that backdrop, Lennar has continued to perform very well. While pro forma sales were lower by 2% year-over-year, deliveries were up by 17.3% and we achieved net earnings of almost $800 million this quarter. These results enabled us to repay $275 million in senior notes, opportunistically repurchase $250 million of stock and end up with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 36.9%, which is an 800 basis point improvement over last year, before we purchased CalAtlantic. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flow over 2019 and expect to use cash to pay down -- to both to pay down debt, while continuing to opportunistically repurchase stock.  Additionally, we're focused on reverting to our core homebuilding platform by repositioning opportunistically monetizing noncore assets and business lines in order to drive efficiencies and enhance cash flow. This enables our management team to strengthen their focus on our core homebuilding business. Let me briefly walk through some examples. As noted in our press release, we sold and closed our Rialto Investment and asset management platform for $340 million in the fourth quarter. While we continue to hold valuable asset investment assets, we will no longer oversee, nor be engaged in the active management of Rialto. Next, we contracted to sell our real estate brokerage business, which closed for cash and a small profit in the first quarter of 2019. Lennar's management team, again, will no longer be engaged in the running of that business as well.  Also in the fourth quarter, we contracted for and closed in the early part of the first quarter, the sale of the majority of our North American title group to a technology title company named States Title. In this transaction, States Title acquired for cash, debt and ownership in States Title, nearly all of our retail title agency business as well as our wholly owned title insurance carrier. Lennar has retained the title insurance agency business that services our core homebuilding operation. With this transaction, we opportunistically monetize a key noncore asset. We executed on our strategy of investing in transformational technology teams and platforms in our industry. We allowed a truly innovative industry newcomer to gain national scale overnight so they can build on that platform to dramatically change their market and we turned oversight of that operating platform over to States Title who is a best-in-class technology partner.  We've also strategically invested in the home insurance platform named Hippo. Hippo is building the leading technology-based, direct-to-consumer home owners insurance company by creating a very efficient purchase process and delivering modern coverage with an ongoing and proactive approach to insurance. Lennar's partnering with Hippo to not only create the easiest possible insurance onboarding and purchase flow, but is also focusing on providing its customers with modern and extensive coverage. As with States Title, we're exiting the oversight of that noncore business and investing with and aligning ourselves with technology innovators and best-of-breed service providers at the forefront of creating a modern experience for our customers. We have emphasized before that we're very serious about investing in technologies and technology teams that can change our industry and enhance our company's execution. Now that strategy is facilitating our reversion to core strategy, enabling us to reduce overhead while we focus on our core homebuilding business and partner with best-of-breed technology partners to create a new and exciting customer experience for our homebuyers.  Putting this together, and very simply, our reversion to core and technology investment strategies have combined to enable us to rationalize our overall business, recognize significant cash flow and profits, improve our customers' experience, while reducing headcount under our management by now approximately 2,000 associates to date. This strategy will continue to reduce company overhead and increase efficiency in our core operations. We're continuing to build a better mousetrap.  Before I turn over to Rick, Jon and Diane, let me just say that even with the softness in current market conditions, we are very excited about our position and our business strategy today. We truly transformed our company. We benefit from the size and scale we've amassed in each of our strategic markets. We are generating strong cash flow and bottom line profitability. Our balance sheet is strengthening, while we use the weakness of market to opportunistically repurchase shares. We are shedding noncore assets to generate cash and to partner with tech companies, who can help enhance our customers experience, while reducing overheads. While there is uncertainty in the homebuilding market today and we will forego detailed full year guidance until the selling season brings additional clarity. We're extremely well positioned to manage market conditions as they present themselves. Based on our existing land position and our operational strategy and our dynamic pricing model, we fully expect to deliver over 50,000 homes this year with increased efficiency, strong bottom line profitability and continued strong cash flow. With that, let me turn over to the rest of the team to give further detail on the quarter and year-end.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. This is Rick. In spite of somewhat softer market conditions, we achieved strong top and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the successful integration of CalAtlantic. Revenues for the quarter totaled $6.5 billion, representing a 71% increase from 2017. This was largely driven by 64% increase in deliveries to 14,154 homes. Our gross margins, excluding backlog and construction in process write-up totaled 22.1%. This was slightly below our prior guidance as we chose to aggressively sell completed inventory and price to market as the market softened in the quarter. Our SG&A in the quarter was 7.9%. This marks an all-time quarterly low and a 50 basis point improvement from 2017. It also highlights the power of our increased local market scale and our operating leverage. Net earnings for the quarter totaled $796 million, up 157% from 2017. Excluding the gain on the sale of Rialto, net earnings totaled $568 million, up 83% from 2017. New orders for the quarter totaled 10,611 homes, up 44% from the prior year with the dollar value of approximately $4.2 billion, representing a 49% increase.  On a proforma basis, new home orders decreased 2% from the prior year. In the quarter, the combination of higher sales prices and mortgage rates moderated demand, leading to reduced traffic, slower absorptions and increased incentives. Our sales pace per community dropped sequentially and year-over-year from 3.1 to 2.7. Sales incentives increase sequentially from 5.2% to 5.6%, but remained lower than our fourth quarter in 2017.  In December of 2019, our fiscal year, we did see an increase in qualified traffic and were able to reduce our sales incentives. While it's too soon to tell, we are optimistic that improved consumer confidence and wage growth combined with lower mortgage rates will spur increased activity as we move into the spring selling season. We ended the fourth quarter with a sales backlog of 15,616 homes with a total dollar value of $6.6 billion, which was up 75% and 85%, respectively from 2017.  As I said earlier in the fourth quarter, we strategically closed and sold a lot of completed inventory at market prices to generate cash flow and to avoid a buildup in inventory in the current soft market environment. In addition, a large percentage of our sales during the quarter due to our dynamic pricing model that Jon will discuss further, were sales earlier in the construction process. The combined impact of this strategy leaves us positioned with a historically low beginning first quarter completed unsold inventory and a backlog with a significant concentration of early-stage sales. Based on this, our first quarter 2019 deliveries should be in the range of 9,000 to 9,500 homes.  As we look out over the year, given our existing land positions and our production-orientated operating strategy, we comfortably expect to deliver over 50,000 homes in fiscal 2019. As I mentioned last quarter, we are laser focused on cash flow generation to reduce debt and to opportunistically repurchase shares. To further enhance our cash flow generation, we are continuing our pivot to a land-lighter operating model with an emphasis on controlling more land versus a more cash-intensive land acquisition and development program.  We ended the year with approximately 25% of our homesites controlled via option contracts and similar arrangements and our goal is to increase this to over 40% in the next several years. This shift in land strategy will increase our returns on inventory and generate additional cash flow. As I mentioned last quarter, we entered into strategic agreements with three of our long-standing regional developers in the southeast to provide us access to their current land portfolios and exclusive access to the future residential land acquired and developed by these developers. While the three deals are slightly different, in each one we made a strategic investment to achieve the following deal attributes: one, limit our land-related overhead costs; two, capitalize on the proven expertise, infrastructure, local market knowledge and deep relationship of the management teams running these established companies; three, control residential land entitled, acquired and developed by these strong regional developers; four, acquire land at a discount to current market values and/or participate in the development profit of their operating companies; and five, in some cases, receive homesites on a just-in-time basis. While we're at the early stages of reshaping our land program, through these three initial partnerships, we will have access to approximately 20,000 additional homesites which should increase our controlled position to approximately 31% and move us much closer to our 40% goal we announced last quarter, with more to come as these relationships expand.  In addition, we are in discussions with regional developers in other markets and we're confident that we can execute similar programs with them.  Before I turn it over to Jon, I'd like to give you an update on LMC, our multifamily development business. On the brighter side of a soft housing market, our rental apartment business has seen significant pickup in both rents and lease-ups. LMC generated $42.7 million in operating earnings in fiscal 2018, which was down from 2017 due to a strategic shift from a merchant build-to-sell model to a build-to-hold model. While we still have a pipeline of 30 merchant-build communities with over 9,000 homes and a total development cost of $3.6 billion, our real focus is to create long-term cash flow and value through the buildout of our Lennar Multifamily Venture 1 and 2. Lennar Multifamily Venture was our first -- number one, was our first build-to-core vehicle, where we raised $2.2 billion from six global, sovereign and institutional investors. The LMV I capital has been fully allocated across 39 assets and 11,673 homes with a total development cost of $4.1 billion. Of the 39 assets, 10 are completed and stabilized, 12 are in lease-up, 16 are under construction and one is about to start construction. Based on the appraised value of the 10 assets that have completed construction and stabilized at the end of fiscal 2018, the current market value of Lennar's investment is $320 million on our basis of $219 million, resulting in a cumulative gain of $101 million. As this venture is held at historical cost basis, this gain has not been included in LMC's operating earnings and represents future profits for Lennar.  In addition, we believe there is significant tremendous built-up gain in the balance of the 29 communities, given that they are fully built out -- bid out with strong rent and lease-up dynamics in an improving rental market. In addition to LMV I, we recently completed the fourth close of LMV II, our second build-to-close vehicle. LMV II currently has committed capital of $787 million, has one asset under construction and has started predevelopment on seven communities with the total pipeline of 3,015 apartment homes and a total development cost of $1.3 billion.  In addition, LMV II has six additional seed assets that will be contributed in subsequent closings as additional partners come in through the end of March of '19. With a total merchant-build and build-to-core pipeline of 83 communities, totaling over 26,000 apartments homes with the development cost of over $10 billion, we are extremely well positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders in an improving rental market. And now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jonathan Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. Today, I'm going to give an update on the merger integration, cost synergies, direct construction cost, SG&A leverage and our production-orientated operating platform driven by our dynamic pricing model. In our fourth quarter, we completed the integration of CalAtlantic. Everyone is on the same systems, all land purchase are underwritten the same way, all contracts of every type are all the same, all divisions are combined under one roof per market, all new communities are everything's included. We're all on the same page, we are one Lennar.  Next, I want to confirm that we exceeded our cost synergy target of $160 million for 2018 by about $10 million. This is split between corporate and SG&A savings and direct construction cost savings at about $85 million each. We continue to be confident in our prior guidance for 2019 and reaffirm the synergy target of $380 million, about $265 million of this is from direct construction cost savings and $115 million from corporate and SG&A savings. I want to give some color on what we see with construction cost and in particular with lumber pricing. In the fourth quarter, construction cost increased 7.8% from Q4 2017. We estimate that about 30% of this increase was driven by increased lumber cost as peak lumber pricing impacted our Q4 deliveries. As the lumber market dropped from $650 to $330 per thousand board feet in the fall of 2018, we aggressively renegotiated lumber pricing for our fourth quarter starts. We'll begin to see the benefits of these lower prices with deliveries in -- late in the first quarter and receive the full benefit of this lower pricing in the second half of the year.  An additional 20% of the increase was in framing labor, so the combined labor and material for framing represents 50% of that increase. In 2019, under the platform of one Lennar, we're focused on continuing to the be the Builder of Choice to the trades and on value engineering to reduce cost as an offset to the ongoing cost pressures from the constrained labor environment. Given our size and scale in the majority of our markets, our Builder of Choice program is presenting itself in the form of increased interest from trades in bidding our communities. While this is not yet resulted in lower cost, we're beginning to see the opportunity for a more stable cost environment and more predictable production schedules as more trades choose to work for us over other builders. Additionally, if the market continues to remain soft, our production-oriented focus will allow us to move quickly to realize reduce cost in an accelerated production pace, or if the market returns to normalized levels we'll have a superior position with more home started and available to sell and the critically needed trade base to deliver them.  With our combined size and scale, we're able to leverage our SG&A to all-time lows of 7.9% in Q4 and 8.5% for fiscal year 2018, improvements of 50 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. Part of this improvement is due to our focus on the sales process by lowering our average realtor commission to 2.4% in Q4, an improvement of 20 basis points year-over-year. As Rick mentioned, we continue to sell inventory by pricing to market. This is directly related to our dynamic pricing model, which demonstrated several clear benefits as we managed through the fourth quarter. Our dynamic pricing model gave us real-time visibility on where we needed to take actions and on how to step pricing on a home-by-home basis.  By taking the action of pricing homes to sell at current market conditions, we sold homes earlier in the construction process, including selling more homes prior to construction starting. We ended up fourth quarter with an average of almost three homes per community sold prior to construction starting, a historic high for the company. Our dynamic pricing focus resulted in our -- ending the year with an average of 1.1 completed inventory homes per community, which is the same exact level of inventory that we had at the end of 2017. Comparing inventory to the end of last year, a time which was both prior to the merger and in a significantly better market, validates the effectiveness of our operating model.  In the short term, by selling homes earlier in the process, we'll have a lower backlog conversion ratio in exchange for improve cash flow and minimized incentives. And over the long term, we expect to see an improvement in our return on investment. As we enter 2019, we're well positioned with an efficient overhead structure and a focused Builder of Choice operational program that will allow us to execute effectively through either soft or improving market conditions.  Moving forward, we plan to maintain our existing construction start pace and to use our dynamic pricing model to enable us to price to current market conditions as they evolve. By executing this strategy, we'll take advantage of the strong spring selling season with increased earnings in cash flow or in the case of the continuing soft market, we'll maximize our cash flow and return on inventory. Now I'd like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon, and good morning to everyone. So our reported fourth quarter EPS was $2.42. When you add back the net of the gain on the sale of Rialto with other nonrecurring Rialto expenses, purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition and integration costs, our adjusted EPS was $1.96. So that's a very high-level view of our results, so now let me walk you through some of the details of our fourth quarter. Some of these items have already been highlighted, but let's start with homebuilding.  Revenues from home sales increased 79% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 64% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 9% increase in average sales price. From a pro forma perspective, our Q4 2018 deliveries increased 17% from pro forma 2017. Our fourth quarter gross margin on home sales was 22.1%, excluding the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The prior years' gross margin was 22.4%.  Our gross margin was impacted by an increase in cost, which was partially offset by an increase in average sales price and an increase in sales incentives. Sales incentives improved 10 basis points to 5.6% from 5.7% in the prior year. Our fourth quarter SG&A was 7.9%, which was the lowest quarter SG&A in the company's history compared to 8.4% in the prior year. As Jon mentioned, that the improvement was due to improved operating leverage as a result of increased volumes as well as efficiencies in our sales process and continued focus on obtaining benefits from our technology initiative. So as a result of the above noted gross margin and SG&A percent, our fourth quarter operating margin was 14.2%, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress compared to 14% in the prior year.  We opened 139 new communities during the fourth quarter and closed 122 communities to end the quarter with 1,329 active communities. New home orders increased 44% and new order dollar value increased 49% in the fourth quarter and our cancellation rate was 19%.  From a pro forma perspective, our Q4 2018 new orders decreased 2% year-over-year. And one point regarding deliveries and new orders, in connection with the CalAtlantic merger, we reassessed how we evaluate our business and allocate resources. As a result, we modified our homebuilding operating segments into four reportable segments, East, Central, Texas and West. All prior-period information has been adjusted to conform with the current presentation and we will be filing an 8-K with the pro forma deliveries and new orders information for 2017 and 2018.  Jon mentioned, as a result of our focus on inventory management and with the assistance of our dynamic pricing tool's we ended the quarter with 1,451 completed unsold homes, which is 1.1 homes per community and this is the low end of a very long-term range. And so obviously, inventory is being carefully managed. At the end of the quarter, our homesites owned and controlled were 270,000, of which 202,000 are owned and 68,000 are controlled.  And finally, the fourth quarter joint venture land sales and other category had a combined earnings of about $1 million compared to $12.4 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of valuation adjustments related to assets at a joint venture. So when turning to Financial Services. In the fourth quarter, our Financial Services segment had operating earnings of $58.7 million compared to $42.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $43.9 million from $27.8 million in the prior year. Originations increased to $3.1 billion from $2.5 billion, 98% of originations were from purchase business, while only 2% were from refis. Mortgages higher volume, primarily from the CalAtlantic combination, drove significant operating leverage, notwithstanding a more competitive mortgage market from the decline in refis. Capture rate was 74% the combined Lennar and CalAtlantic, versus 80% in the prior year, which was Lennar only. Historically, CalAtlantic's capture rate was lower than Lennar's, so we should see some continued improvement in our combined rate as we capture more of that business. Title operating earnings increased to $18.2 million from $14.6 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the addition of CalAtlantic closings and a greater mix of purchase business with higher transaction values versus the prior year.  Turning to Multifamily, our Multifamily segment had operating earnings of $33 million compared to $38.6 million in the prior year. In the current year, we recorded $22.2 million of equity in earnings from the sale of two operating properties, $15.7 million gain on the sale of our investment and operating -- in an operating property, and a $5.8 million promote revenue related to properties in LMV I. And then turning to Rialto, as we mentioned in the fourth quarter, we concluded on the sale of our Rialto investment and asset management businesses for $340 million. So beginning with our first quarter of 2019, our Rialto Mortgage Finance earnings will be reported with LFS's earnings and the remaining Rialto assets, primarily are fund investments of approximately $300 million, will be reported as other in our P&L and balance sheet.  Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23%, which was lower than our anticipated 24%, primarily due to a favorable state tax settlement finalized during the quarter. And then turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash. As Stuart noted, we repurchased 6 million shares for $250 million and we had continued success with the delevering, as Stuart mentioned in his opening comments. As we look forward to -- as we look to the full year of 2018, our homebuilding operations generated about $2 billion of cash flow, excluding the acquisition of CalAtlantic and we retired $1.7 billion of Lennar senior notes.  Stockholders equity grew to $14.6 billion and our book value per share grew to $44.97 per share. So as we go to guidance for the first quarter, in '19, we expect new orders between 9,700 and 10,000 in the first quarter. As Rick mentioned, we expect to deliver between 9,000 and 9,500 homes. We expect our Q1 average sales price to be about $410,000. We expect our Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 20% to 20.5% and our SG&A to be in the range of 9.5% to 9.8%. And for the combined category of joint ventures, land sales and other, we expect a Q1 loss of approximately $15 million. We believe our Financial Services earnings will be between $20 million and $22 million. We believe our Multifamily earnings will be about $5 million and we expect our Q1 corporate G&A to be about 2.2% of total revenues. We estimate that our tax rate will be 25.5% and our weighted average share count should be approximately $322 million.
Richard Beckwitt: Shares.
Diane Bessette: I'm sorry, 322 million shares. And as we mentioned for the full year we expect to deliver over 50,000 homes. So with that, we'd like to turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman: Congratulations on a strong quarter in a tough environment, especially the SG&A leverage. You've given somewhat guidance, given that you expect to hit your 50,000 units delivery goal for '19 as well as your goal to hit your synergies that you've outlined for the integration. So when we think about prioritizing strategically, how you see yourself in a market that might remain sluggish or continue to moderate, if you think about that goal of 50,000, it sounds like you're going -- focusing on volume at the expense of margin. Is there a range of margin where you'd actually pull back, because it's below what you would feel as an acceptable level? And therefore, you would maybe fall short of that 50,000? Or you're going to monetize your volume no matter what and navigate through what might be more challenging environment? That's my first question. I have a follow-up.
Richard Beckwitt: So Ivy, I'll start of and then I'll flip it over to Stuart and Jon. This is Rick. We're really geared up as a production-oriented builder right now. And given the tight labor-end market, we feel it's extremely important to keep our production pace up, we have the land that's in queue and our intent is to build and deliver more than 50,000 homes this year, even if it's at the expense of some margin. We know that it's important to generate cash flow. It's important for us to leverage our G&A and I think that's the best operating model that we can have in this environment and if builders pull back with the market softness, we're going to increase our share.
Stuart Miller: I think, Jon highlighted it well in his comments and noted that we're going to continue producing and there could be some impact on margin if the market continues to be soft. But that'll hold us in good stead. If the market comes back, as we fully expect it will, we'll be profitable with strong cash flow and if profitability comes down a little bit, we'll still have strong cash flow and that's the strategy going forward.
Jonathan Jaffe: I'd only add, Ivy, that if the market does remain slow, we'll have some offset to margin pressure from reduced cost as what is now a very constrained labor market will become more available through lower production levels in the industry.
Richard Beckwitt: And the ancillary benefit will be, as we see in the land market when builders adjust their pace, there'll be incremental opportunities for us to step into some land positions that will be attractive at lower cost base. So we're continuing to move forward.
Ivy Zelman: That's very helpful. In listening to your prepared comments, really what we didn't get was sort of a little bit more in the lead, maybe take us through sort of best performing markets and where you've seen weakness, maybe more weakness above the average. But also price point, are you seeing difference in overall activity based on whether it's affordable or a move up or luxury, if you can walk us through some more details on regions and product that would be helpful?
Jonathan Jaffe: Ivy, it's Jon. I'll start and turn it over to Rick. No surprise as you've seen your fieldwork. We've seen more activity, better absorption pace at the lower price points and as you move into the mid kind of price points, we saw stability at the beginning of the quarter and then that sort of softened as it went through the quarter and at the higher price point, you saw the greatest weakness. Clearly, we saw the greatest differential in absorptions and the higher-price California coastal markets, so the Bay Area, Orange County, even to some degree the Inland Empire, which was pretty hot market saw the effect of what was happening in the coastal markets. Those same coastal markets also affect some market that benefit from them like Sacramento or Reno, which typically benefits from people move down the Bay Area, so there was a trickle-down effect to slow absorption pace in those markets. Seattle, which was really strong market saw some pullback as well. So those were the weaker markets. As you look at the east, it's actually pretty stable from an absorption standpoint. But the same patterns of more affordably priced product moving faster and more expensive products appropriately slowing down some.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, I guess, the only thing I'd add to that, Ivy, is, as Jon said, once you get to the higher price points. The market is there. Buyers are being very particular, but it's a bit softer. With regard to specific markets, I know Houston always comes up with the volatility in the oil market. The market has gotten a little bit skittish above that sort of $350,000 price. Fortunately, we have a great position in lower-priced communities in that market and so we've been benefiting. An example of a real strong market that you wouldn't think of today is San Antonio. We've got a great position at the lower end of that market and that market is extremely strong right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen East from Wells Fargo.
Stephen East: Rick, you were talking about the developer agreements that you've got going on which are pretty intriguing to me. A couple of different things, one, you mentioned that you would participate in profits, potentially you buy below market, if you could just shed some more light on what you're talking about there? And then what you were just talking about pace versus price, which I totally agree with your strategy that you all ought to be running pace. Will this change your pace any? Does it do anything for you on that front?
Richard Beckwitt: Let me start with the land transactions and these programs. Yes, I'm giving a little bit more incremental information each quarter, Steve, because you keep asking. But I really do want to keep some of this close to the vest. What I do -- what I can share with you is that we have a profit participation in two of the programs, because we made a strategic investment in their operating companies. And through that investment, we'll share in development profits over and above the ability to purchase homesites that are at a below-market cost because of our investment to the extent that these entities sell land that we don't want to build on will participate in the full profit through our interest in the development entities. And another -- and so we've slightly structured different deals, but in essence, they all have the same type of flavor, where we can access land at below cost -- below market cost and also participate in the development profits at the entity level.
Stephen East: Got you. Got you. All right, and does that help your -- ultimately, does that help your velocity any on the pace of your business?
Richard Beckwitt: Ultimately, it should. In the beginning since we're coming out of the ground right now, you won't see a tremendous impact in 2019. But the long-term benefit of these relationships will be that we should be able to leverage more G&A -- that third party G&A at the same point in increasing our return on assets and that's really the model that Stuart laid out for us in our program. That's the whole concept of the land pivot.
Stephen East: All right, all right. And then the other question I had was on the integration savings. Jon, you talked about ahead of schedule, comfortable with the $380 million. When do you think you get to the $380 million run rate, and I guess what would be maybe your biggest risk to not achieving or maybe what could allow you to go beyond the $380 million?
Jonathan Jaffe: Stephen, I don't have in front of me the exact timing of that, but I would say that most of that is in place with national contracts and we'll see continued improvement as we put in place opportunities that were identified through our -- synergy workshops that took place throughout 2018, so it'll progress throughout the year. The target really is to be there by the end of the year and hopefully we'll be a little bit ahead of that. As far as what risk there is, given our strategy of maintaining our pace from a volume standpoint that should not be a risk to it. So I think it's really just, in our court to execute and I got a lot of confidence in our team, from our national purchasing team to our local division that will execute well on this front.
Operator: Question from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.
Trey Morrish: Guys it's actually Trey on for Steve. So with the uncertainty in the market and your decision not to give annual guidance, I'm wondering if it's reasonable to think that you've scaled back some of your land commitments, not necessarily trying to say you've stopped land buying because we assume that you'll continued to buy and develop land, but have you decided to hold off on making some land purchases due to the slowing down and if things reaccelerate you'll probably put the gas on going back towards those land deals you have sitting on the table?
Richard Beckwitt: So from an overall land strategy and we're continuing on our land acquisition program, we've expanded it through these relationships with some very strong third-party regional developers. We do opportunistically take advantage of market weakness when builders pullback from opportunities, it gives us an opportunity to swoop in, generally on something that could be shovel-ready at a price that's more competitive than it was under contract. This is something that's in the Lennar DNA going back 20 years and that's not to suggest that we're going to overpay for something or chase deals in order to get volume. We view things opportunistically and we run our business every day.
Jonathan Jaffe: Trey, this is Jon. I would add, first of all, we're positioned with the land we need for 2019. So we're really talking about as looking forward and to that extent, Rick described what we've gotten in some larger relationship transactions. We're really applying that same kind of thinking to the more local and smaller levels. So not a slowdown in pace, but more a change in shift to structuring deals so that as the market presents itself, we're positioned with more option structures than land owned.
Stuart Miller: It's Stuart, let me just contextualize this and say that from a strategy standpoint, understand that our overarching view is that the market has paused, that it has reacted to higher prices over years together with a rapid increase in interest rates and there's a little bit of sticker shock in the market suggesting. Production deficit and supply constraint in the market, we think is kind of a floor, this market is not likely to go down in an accelerated way. And additionally, we think that the basic economy is strong. Unemployment is low, wage growth is happening. There is general consumer confidence. And so as we look ahead and we think about purchasing land and we think about volume, while there might be some softness, squishing us in the market, our strategies really informed by of you that the market is generally healthy. It's going through an adjustment and so our land strategy continues to be consistent. As Rick and Jon highlight, opportunistic in nature, but we're moving forward with a fair degree of confidence that the market will self-correct.
Stephen Kim: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks, guys, it's Steve Kim. I am on again now. I wanted to move to a question about demand, I guess. You made some intriguing remarks about how traffic picked up in December as rates eased, obviously our expectation is that there always a little more here in January and indicated that incentives were reduced as well. I was curious first off if there was any geographic differences to call out and I think specifically what clients and investors are focused on is California, whether or not what you describe could be applied to that market as well. And then related to demand also, the government shutdown to also something that's sort of an exogenous factor. And I was curious if you could give some sense as to whether you think that's having any impact or likely to have an impact on the ability of buyers to re -- buying to rebound, maybe particularly in the DC market or maybe any up markets you might want to call out?
Jonathan Jaffe: Hey, Steve, it's Jon. First, simple on the government shutdown, we've not seen any impact from that to the market in the DC area. Relative to California, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen, I think, the biggest delta in change in absorption pace. So as we saw towards the end of the fourth quarter, more incentives to sell homes that will be delivered going forward to those stimulate the market given the nature of that magnitude of change. And what we see more currently through December is sort of affirming better traffic, better quality traffic and affirming of the pricing opportunity because of more of willingness to buy from the traffic that we're seeing.
Trey Morrish: Yes, that's really encouraging, Jon. But would you say that what you're seeing in California is mirroring what you're seeing across the nation or do you think it's actually maybe a little bit better -- a better response?
Jonathan Jaffe: No, I wouldn't say it's better, I'd say it's probably still lagging a little bit. So firmer than it was, but still as -- on a comparison basis, not as healthy yet as the rest of the country.
Richard Beckwitt: But in either case frankly, our operating model right now is to continue production and to solve for margin and so the thing at risk in the P&L will be where that margin goes to. And if we need to sacrifice margin in order to keep pace, in order to maximize net operating margin that's what we're going to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: First question I had was just following up on some of the remarks around the more recent trends and the stock kind of moved pretty aggressively following earlier comments around the traffic picking up a little bit in December. And I just wanted to compare that, if possible, given that it seems like the market is focusing on these comments pretty strongly here just to get some more clarity around it. Because the guidance for the first quarter, if you look at it on a pro forma basis, looks like you're expecting orders at the midpoint to be around down 10% year-over-year on a pro forma basis versus down 2% in the fourth quarter. So when you talk about traffic picking up a little bit in December, I was curious if you saw any type of similar pickup in order trends, because it does seem like from the guidance things, you expect the sale -- I would assume the sales pace and the trends to still be worse in your February quarter versus your November quarter?
Richard Beckwitt: So what's difficult to project and look at is we're basing our pickup in traffic on a December month, which is a very seasonably slow month. What we have done with regard to first quarter expectations is take, basically, sales absorptions and sort of streamlined that was over the next three months in the quarter, which is resulting in a down year-over-year on a pro forma basis, but we don't feel it's appropriate to give guidance that picks up an activity that's above what we've seen in the field. So what we're trying to do is just be straight up with you as we did last quarter. And I think that's what you're seeing in the numbers.
Michael Rehaut: So just to clarify before I ask my second question, you're saying that you haven't seen a similar pickup in sales pace in terms of actual orders in December, just more on the traffic side?
Richard Beckwitt: Saw increased traffic, increased qualified traffic, increased folks willing to buy. But as you look at December versus other months, it's a seasonably low month of the year, so it's difficult to use that as a barometer for the rest of the balance of the year.
Stuart Miller: It's really hard at this time of the year to get a reading from the market, because the season tends to impact what you're getting as a feedback loop. And so we're not extrapolating that forward, we're giving you a sense of what we're seeing.
Michael Rehaut: No. Very much appreciated and understood. Secondly, turning more big picture, wanted to circle back also to your land initiatives, your partnerships with the three different developers. And you describe they have still around over 200,000 lots owned, which would be, on forward numbers, about four years of owned year supply of land. As you develop these relationships, as you continue to shift towards the land-light strategy or lighter, where could you see that four year supply go over the next 2 to 3 years, particularly given that there is still some uncertainty in -- as the cycle matures? I presume that you want that a lighter-land position to more and more assert itself.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, so that's exactly what our program is. We started this soft visit going back several years ago. Coming out of the downturn, we were aggressive buyers of land and we were opportunistic. As we sit today, we're about -- last quarter we ended the year with 25% controlled through these additional relationships, we're up to about 31% controlled and I'm extremely optimistic that we'll get to north of 40% relatively shortly. And as we move forward and establish these relationships across the country, which I'm confident we'll be able to do, I think we'll be able to exceed what our original goal was. [Indiscernible] to get better returns and achieve all the benefits we identified.
Operator: Question from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood: I wanted to ask about the lumber comments. If framing and lumber in total have been driving half of the 7% year-over-year increase in direct construction cost and that, that will abate by about 2Q, that would seem to be a pretty big boost to gross margins following 1Q. Would that be enough to kind of get gross margins back to level year-over-year? Or is it not giving enough, given the incentive pressures?
Jonathan Jaffe: But first, let me clarify that the combined labor materials about half of that, 50% as I said. The material portion of that lumber is about 30%. So as we see lumber recover in pricing and we got that locked in, you could translate that too on average between $3,000 to $3,500 per home lower cost going through our system. Now I think, at the same time, the reality is that the current environment, there is a constrained labor situation with upward pressure on labor cost. Given that we expect the market to stabilize, really don't see an improvement in that environment. So sort of see those as offsetting and so I wouldn't look at a full recovery margin just for lumber.
Stuart Miller: We've been careful not to give too much guidance looking ahead, because there is uncertainty. As I highlighted in my remarks, there has been some pressure on pricing that's come from the market, which is downward relative to margin. There's also been pressure from other materials, labor and land pricing. These moving parts are going to continue to define themselves as we go through the first and second quarter of the year. That's why we didn't want to give too much guidance, because we are in an uncertain moment. Let's wait and see how they resolve themselves. Certainly, there's some tailwind coming from lumber. We know that and we'll see if it's enough to kind of help stabilize margins. It's good question, but we'll have to wait and see.
Nishu Sood: Got it, got it. Now that's very helpful. And then the second question, you folks have demonstrated, through cycles, going back, obviously, the past couple are even more, a nimbleness as market conditions adjust. And so I would expect, the weakness having started during a seasonally slow period of year, that nimbleness was probably an advantage. But as the spring selling season comes and if demand hasn't picked up, it might argue that the broader incentive -- incentives out there in the marketplace might increase as people catch up in terms of -- as the demand gets heavier during the spring selling season. Am I thinking about that the right way? Are you concerned that as the spring selling season comes around to that -- the incentive pressure may amount?
Stuart Miller: I think that's a good framing of exactly the topic. It's why as we sit here today, we aren't going too far -- getting too far ahead of ourselves and looking at where the marketer is. There are those moving parts and we certainly might have to use additional incentives if the market does not get -- does not start to accelerate as we go into the spring. But I want to go back again to my comments, Nishu and highlight that we're still dealing with production deficit. We're still dealing with a fundamentally strong economic foundation, low unemployment, wages going up, consumer confidence generally strong. There are factors -- macroeconomic factors that can adjust that and we don't underestimate that. But we still feel that the base for housing has a more limited downside and a significant upside as inventories are low, production has been low. We're certainly seeing that one of the great beneficiaries of a slower home sales environment is the rental market, meaning our rental program has been doing extremely well. And so it means that demand is out there. Need for dwellings are out there and we think that the market is going to continue to be relatively strong as we get into the selling season. Let's go with one more question.
Operator: Okay. Our next question is from John Lovallo from Bank of America.
John Lovallo: Maybe just going back on the incentives for one second just to make sure I understand. Understanding that the incentives kind of picked up going into the quarter, then they came down post quarter. I mean would you say that you're back to kind of levels now that you were seeing pre quarter in terms of the incentives?
Richard Beckwitt: So this is Rick. Our incentives for December, which is really just one month and I want to make sure that everybody understands, because as I have said in my commentary, it's too soon to tell where things are going to go. But the incentives for December were consistent with our quarter for the third quarter of last year -- of fiscal 2018. So we saw a market improvement in our sales incentives. That said, as we've discussed throughout the call, we're going to continue our program and price tomorrow and if the -- we have to incentivize more or less, we're going to move inventory.
John Lovallo: Got it. That makes sense. I mean, and Stuart, maybe just a more strategic question. You've talked a lot about reversion to core kind of the technology implementation. How are we thinking about kind of the opportunities on the construction side itself? And the things that you're looking into that could help make that more efficient?
Stuart Miller: Some good questions. You've heard us talk a little bit more about the technologies around Financial Services. All of these discussions have roots some years ago, meaning they don't start up last quarter and we'll report the next quarter. We're working on these things over years and we're starting to discuss them as they bear fruit and as they become relevant to the way that we're configuring our company. Just like we're focused on some of the fintech solutions that are now coming to fruition. We have been hard at work. Particularly, Jon has been hard at work at the tech solutions in and around the production side of our business as well as other components.  There are many ways where we can either partner or develop new technology that can enhance the way that we approach the production process. But they aren't mature enough yet for us to actually start laying them out and feeding them into the way that we guide you as to the configuration of our business sort of the way that will impact our business. But across our platform, many areas, not just construction, also in sales and other areas, we're working on technology solutions and best-of-breed partners that can help us both build the better mousetrap, reduce our overhead and enhance our customer experience. And I hope you're hearing that as we start to articulate this more and more going forward. It's all of those components. A better customer experience, a more efficient operation and using partnerships with best-of-breed leaders like States Title and Hippo to be able to leverage their prowess, their expertise and to build a better program for our customers and for the operations of our company. That's the program and yes, it is in the production part of our business as well.
John Lovallo: Great. Thank you, Stuart. And maybe just one last one in terms of community count for the first quarter, how should we be thinking about that?
Stuart Miller: Wow, that's a tough one to sneak in right at the end. Diane?
Diane Bessette: We gave the new orders guidance, so I think that you'll find that it's pretty consistent on a year-over-year basis, but we can help you through the math of that, if you'd like.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your attention for our fourth quarter and year-end and look forward to keeping you updated as we go through 2019.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you, everyone for joining. You may now disconnect.(

Operator: Thank you. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good and thank you. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I am here with Rick Beckwitt, Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Jaffe, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer and of course David Collins is here and you just heard from Alex Lumpkin. So, I'm going to start with a general strategic overview. Rick and Jon will give the land and operational overview, and Diane will deliver further detail on our third quarter numbers as well as some preliminary guidance for 2019. When we get to Q&A, as always, I'd like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up, so we can accommodate as many participants. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that our once again strong quarterly results derived from a seasoned, well-coordinated operating team that is hands-on and hitting on all cylinders. With pro forma new orders up approximately 11% year-over-year and pro forma deliveries up 11.4% year-over-year, we are tracking above our own internal targets of 7% to 10% per year growth, even through the integration of the CalAtlantic merger. As the coordination of systems integration continues and synergies are run from operations, our management team and operating groups are fully engaged in making the adjustments that keep our performance industry leading and consistent. Over the past quarter, market data -- sorry about that, little technology issue. So over the past quarter, market data has sent mixed signals about the current state of the housing market in general. Sales, permits, starts and existing home sales have all shown decelerating growth rate and on their face seem to indicate slowdown. A natural mortgage application slowdown, which is normal as interest rates have trended higher and refi business dissipates, has contributed to the discourse. Generally speaking, the increases in new and exhibit -- the increases in new and existing sales prices -- home sale prices over the past years together with the general migration of interest rates upward have caused a pause in the progression of the housing recovery. Additionally, labor shortages, trade-driven material price increases and limited approved land availability have both limited production, and therefore limited supply and muted sentiment around the housing market strength and margin sustainability. This has led many to believe that the housing recovery is over or stalled. We do not agree. Instead, we believe the market has taken a natural pause, it will adjust and demand driven by fundamental economic strength will resume. Even as price increases and interest rate movements have moderated demand in the market, we believe that the housing market in the United States remains strong and is primarily driven by the deficit in production that has persisted over a decade. This production deficit defines an overall housing shortage in the country that cannot correct quickly with short labor and limited approved land. Supply of dwellings, both for sale and for rent, is short and demand remains strong, though perhaps slower and more normalized in the short term, as the market adjusts to prices and interest rates. While we clearly saw sales slow and traffic moderate during the third quarter, we feel that this is a natural pause, given the relative strength that has been in the market to date. This pause we believe is a temporary adjustment, as strong unemployment, wage growth, consumer confidence and economic growth drive the consumer to catch up. Now even as market conditions fluctuate, I am increasingly enthusiastic about the evolving position of our business platform with size and market share in the best national market and as the leader in the home building industry. We're not only well positioned to execute on our current operational strategies, but we have become ever more adaptable and capable of quickly adjusting to changing landscapes around us. As a management team, we believe that we're excellently structured and positioned to continue to grow our business, while we leverage scale in each of our markets to drive efficiencies and we implement new technologies to enhance bottom line and free cash flow. Given the current mismatch [Audio Gap]. Before I turn over to Rick and Jon and Diane, let me bring -- let me provide a brief map of our operating and capital allocation strategy going forward. Then our management team will review the quarter in detail and give more guidance on our road ahead. So let me begin by noting that our debt to total cap is right now at 40% at the end of the third quarter versus 42.4% last quarter. Our net debt to total cap is 39%. Using a combination of strong earnings and very strong and improving cash flow, we’ve continued to improve our balance sheet and this affords us great flexibility in the strategy that we deploy going forward. We have grown and will continue to grow our top line as the market evolves. Through this year and next year, we will continue to grow top line, consistent with our land driven home site growth strategy of 7% to 10% improvement per year.  As we look ahead to 2020, given the extremely tight and expensive land market, we’ll begin to tap back that home site growth target, driving our land acquisition program closer to the 5% to 7% range, while we continue to focus on our land soft pivot strategy and decrease the percentage of home sites we purchased outright versus control under option, generating higher rates of return and greater cash flow. While we moderate future home site growth at the top line, we will continue to aggressively grow bottom line by focusing more sharply on operational excellence and efficiency. We'll continue to use our size and scale in strategic markets to realize on the synergies from the CalAtlantic merger, drive efficiencies and construction costs and technique and leverage SG&A. Our focus on operational efficiency will enable us to maintain consistently high gross margins, while we expand our net operating margin as well. Various elements of our program such as the reduction of debt and debt service and builder of choice initiatives with our building partner base will continue to offset pressures on gross margins. Additionally, our technology initiatives with Opendoor, Blend, Hippo, States Title, Notarize and others enable us to build a better mousetrap, reduce SG&A, and drive a higher net margin. Strong margins together with a reduced growth rate and focused attention on our soft land pivot combined to generate greater free cash flow. With cash flow building and our balance sheet already strong and improving, we expect to allocate capital strategically, first to continue to pay down debt, but simultaneously to actively consider the repurchase of our stock opportunistically. If the market discounts the value of our business, then our best returns on invested capital will be realized by investing in the assets that we know best and we are always driven by what is best for creating shareholder value. Additionally, as we've discussed in prior calls, we are continuing to drive efficiencies by focusing on our core homebuilding business. This means repositioning or opportunistically monetizing non-core assets and business lines in order to drive efficiencies or enhance cash flow. Lennar’s Rialto platform is a good example that we've discussed in prior quarters. As we have noted, we've engaged investment bankers and began a process to maximize value about two quarters ago. To date, we've mapped a constructive reconfiguration of that segment with Rialto mortgage finance -- with the Rialto mortgage finance component, better situated with Lennar financial services, starting December 1 and where efficiencies and synergies can drive even better operating results.  Additionally, the Rialto balance sheet assets are being segregated as well and monetized over time to maximize their value. This leaves a very manageable asset investment management business, defining our remaining Rialto segment. As part of our process, we've received offers to monetize this business, many of them attractive and we're currently evaluating those offers. But as you know with our company, we will act opportunistically and in the best interest of shareholders. We will sell if the price and the terms negotiated are attractive and otherwise, we’ll remain -- we’ll retain this segment and drive earnings forward. As always, over the next quarters, we will keep you updated as decisions are made and we’ll not be fielding further questions during this call on this very active process.  Each of our core asset and business segments is being positioned for maximum efficiency and performance. Our objective, as we've stated before, is to return to operating as a simplified, pure play home builder, while maximizing the value and positioning of the extraordinary franchises we've created here at Lennar. So with that said, in conclusion, with another excellent quarter behind us and a well-defined strategy for the future, we feel very confident that fluctuations in the market will come and go and even work to our long-term advantage as we execute our strategy.  And with that, let me turn over to Rick and the team to give further detail on the quarter and begin our view of 2019. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. Let me start quickly by summarizing our results in the third quarter and then Jon and I will update you on some of our strategic focuses. Net earnings for the quarter totaled 453 million, up 82% from 2017. Our core homebuilding operation really produced. New orders for the quarter totaled 12,319 homes, up 62% from the prior year with the dollar value of approximately 5.1 billion, representing a 73% increase from last year.  On a pro forma basis, new home orders increased 11% from the prior year. We delivered 12,613 homes, which was up 66% from 2017. Revenues in the quarter totaled 5.7 billion, representing a 74% increase. We ended the third quarter with a sales backlog of 19,220 homes with the dollar value of 8.4 billion, up 88% and 105% respectively from 2017. Our gross margin, excluding the backlog and construction and progress write-up totaled 21.9%, which exceeded the top side of our guidance last quarter. Finally, our SG&A in the quarter was 8.6%. This marks an all-time third quarter low and a 60 basis point improvement from 2017. It also highlights the success of our CalAtlantic integration and the power of our increased local market scale and our operating leverage. With the CalAtlantic integration behind us, we are laser focused on three strategic areas. First, construction costs and operating efficiencies; second, land acquisition and development and third, technology that improves our business. On the construction front, we are leveraging our local market and national scale to be the low cost producer. Jon will review our activities in this area, which also focused on adjustments to how we build and procure materials to lower our overall installed cost. On the land front, we've continued to execute our soft pivot strategy, with an emphasis on controlling more land versus a more cash intensive land acquisition and development program.  Today, approximately 25% of our home sites are controlled via option contracts and similar arrangements and our expectation is to increase this over the next several years to about 40%. This shift in land strategy will increase our returns and generate additional cash flow. During the third quarter, we entered into strategic agreements with three of our longstanding large regional developers to provide us access to their current land portfolios and exclusive access to the future residential land acquired and developed by these developers. Given our new leading local market scale and our ability to build through all of the land that these developers own and control, we were able to structure win-win programs with each of these three companies. While each deal is slightly different, they all allow us to, one, limit our land related overhead costs, as these companies have full operations that entitle, develop and acquire land; second, control the residential land entitled, acquired and developed by these regional developers; and third and most importantly, receive the home sites developed by these companies on a just in time basis. Our focus going forward is to align ourselves with proven regional developers that have the infrastructure and expertise to feed Lennar with a continuous stream of finished home sites. While we're at the early stages of reshaping our land program, these initial three developers provide great opportunity as they own and control approximately 55,000 home sites, with more finished home sites to come as a result of the exclusive relationships and agreements we have with these companies. In addition, we believe we can expand and execute this strategy with these developers in other markets and that this program can serve as a template with other proven regional developers across the country. On the technology side and systems side, we are keenly focused on investing in or developing new technology that improves the operational efficiency of our business. On prior calls, Stuart has highlighted our investment in Opendoor and our intense focus on digital marketing, which allows us to reduce our customer acquisition costs. These initiatives have produced both incremental new sales and allowed us to increase our operating margins. In the third quarter, our Rialto spend decreased another 10 basis points to 2.3% of revenue from 2.4% in the second quarter of 2017. On a year-over-year basis, our Rialto spend was down 30 basis points. In addition, we are also focused on increasing the real time flow of information to our operating teams. Jon has highlighted our dynamic pricing model in the past and we are now rolling out real time dashboards that allow our teams to seamlessly track key operating metrics, which should increase our absorption pace and lower our overall SG&A expenses. We plan to continue these initiatives, as we're just scratching the surface to unlock the many process improvements that will increase our bottom line profitability going forward. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. Today, I'm going to give an update on integration, cost synergies, the lumber market, the US Mexico Canadian agreement’s impact on lumber as well as an overview of some of the markets in our western area. First, I want to let you know what we mean when we say we are substantially complete with the integration of CalAtlantic. In all of our divisions and all communities, we are either set for building out the remaining home sites under a modified design studio program or have converted the remaining communities to Lennar’s Everything’s Included platform.  Going forward, in 2019, all communities will be under the Lennar’s Everything’s Included platform, with the exception of some minor build-outs of existing communities. With respect to systems migrations, this month in October, we will complete 100% of the conversion of our ERP and construction management systems as well as a complete rollout of sales force lightning as a new company wide CRM platform. This is another great example of Lennar’s execution that we feel is best in class. It's fair to say that most companies will take about two years to roll out just the Salesforce CRM, while in just 9 months from the closing date of the merger, we'll have completed the entire migration and rollout of all systems. As we complete 2018, we will do so as one company with the merger integration behind us, focused on delivering our fourth quarter and our goals for 2019. Next, I want to confirm that we're on track to deliver the synergies targets we gave you last quarter of $160 million for 2018. This is split evenly between corporate and SG&A savings and direct construction cost savings. I also want to confirm that we're confident with our prior guidance of achieving synergies of $380 million in 2019. For 2019, the overhead savings will be about 115 million of this total. Again, this is consistent with the savings we communicated to you last quarter. Under our construction cost savings, we're on track to deliver about $265 million of savings from synergies in 2019. We have a lot of visibility into these savings from the detailed work that comes from the division by division synergy workshops that I've described on prior calls. We've seen the strategy of having significant scale in local markets played out as planned. As I mentioned in our release this morning, this scale fits right into our focus on being builder of choice for national manufactures, suppliers and local trades. The builder choice focus began long before the CalAtlantic merger and it’s serving as a great platform to maximize the benefits of increased scale provided by the merger. The key elements of this program are Lennar’s efficient Everything's Included platform, even flow production, job site readiness, cycle time accuracy and dynamic pricing. These combined with the volume of work we have in local markets make us the builder of choice for trade partners, in turn, increasing the number of bids we receive for our work. The increased bids leads to greater ability to manage both construction cost and cycle time.  Now, I want to give some color on what we see with the lumber pricing, which is the largest cost component of our direct cost. Lumber prices peaked in the second quarter of this year, at about $600 per thousand board feet. This represents about $7800 for a typical 2500 square foot home. Today, lumber prices have dropped to about $365 per thousand board feet or $4750 per home, a difference of about $3000 per home. The second quarter pricing will flow through our third and fourth quarter deliveries and the pricing that we see today will start to flow through our first and second quarter deliveries. With respect to the new trade agreement with Canada, there will be no relief from the existing soft lumber tariffs from that agreement. Instead, the countries have left this to be decided by the WTO under an existing complaint filed by the United States. Now, I want to turn to some color on the markets in the West, as a lot of questions have been asked about this. As Stuart noted, we've seen traffic and sales patterns slow, as sales prices have risen, along with increased interest rates. In California markets such as the Inland Empire and Sacramento, our average sales prices increased about 11% year-over-year, while absorption pace in the Inland Empire has moderated from 5.6 sales per community per month last year to 5 sales per community per month this year. In Sacramento, we've actually seen this pace increase to positive from a pace last year of 3.2 sales per community per month to 3.8 this year. In the coastal markets around Orange County, prices are up about 20% and absorption has slowed from about 4.7 sales per community per month to 3.1. Some of this is driven by a dramatic change in mix of product that we offer, for example, in our Altair community in Orange County, we're now selling homes priced about $2 million in our joint venture community with Toll Brothers. In the Bay Area, prices are up about 10%, while absorptions have modified from 5.8 per community last year per month to 4.4 this year. In Seattle, prices continue to decline at double digit rates, while absorptions have cooled from a very hot pace to more normal paces of just below four sales per community per month. In summary, we believe that the sales pace that we're seeing continues to be advantaged by a favorable imbalance of supply and demand, a constraint on land and labor in the Western markets in particular and that this sales pace will support our platform and all of our operating strategies. And we think that as Stuart mentioned earlier that this is just a pause because of dramatic rise in the rates that we've seen in the West, not just percentage wise, but in nominal dollars, very often representing multiple hundred thousand dollar increase year-over-year and we expect as the market adjusts to this increase that we’ll see demand return to a very healthy pace. With that, I’d like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon and good morning to everyone. So before I provide the details of our third quarter results, let me give a simple analysis of our numbers as compared to consensus, as I did last quarter, to assist in understanding some of the noise that continued this quarter. Our reported EPS is $1.37 and the average of all analysts’ estimates is $1.17. The difference is $0.20.  This difference of $0.20 can be separated into two categories. First, non-operating items, representing $0.14 of the difference, and second, operating items, representing $0.06 of the difference. The $0.06 is our operating beat or our outperformance, as you compare our actual results to expectations. So let me give you the details of these two categories, starting with the non-operating items. There are two distinct components to this category. The first item is the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The expectation for Q3 was to record approximately $100 million of write-up. The actual amount recorded was approximately $84 million. The difference between these two amounts is just timing and will flow through in subsequent quarters. The second item is tax rate. Our expected Q3 tax rate was 24%. The actual tax rate was 17.8%. The difference primarily relate to a one-time benefit from a tax accounting method change, implemented during the quarter and energy credit taken in the quarter.  So now, let me turn to the operating items category. The difference here between our actual results and expectations relates to an increase in Q3 deliveries, average sales price and net margin. And as I previously stated, again, that's our operating outperformance. So hopefully that helps simplify our results from a top level. Now, let me walk through the details of our third quarter, starting with homebuilding. As we’ve mentioned, revenues from home sales increased 83% in the third quarter, driven by a 66% increase in wholly owned deliveries to 12,600 and a 10% increase in average sales price to 415,000. Both of these increases of course were primarily a result of CalAtlantic acquisition and as we've highlighted from a pro forma basis, our deliveries increased 11%. Our third quarter gross margin on home sales was 21.9%, excluding the CalAtlantic purchase accounting impact and the prior year’s gross margin of 22.8% was -- which included a $10.3 million insurance recovery that positively impacted the gross margin percentage by 30 basis points in that third quarter of ‘17. Our gross margin benefited from a decrease in sales incentives. Sales incentives improved 30 basis points to 5.2% from 5.5% in the prior year and also improved from 5.3% in the second quarter of this year. Our third quarter SG&A was 8.6%, which as Rick highlighted was the lowest third quarter SG&A in the company's history, compared to 9.2% in the prior year. The improvement was primarily due to the operating leverage as well as our continued laser focus on obtaining benefits from our technology initiatives. We opened 134 new communities during the quarter and closed 147 communities to end the quarter with 1312 active communities. New home orders increased 62% and new order dollar value increased 73% for the third quarter, again primarily as a result of the CalAtlantic acquisition and new orders on a pro forma basis increased 11%. As a result of our focus on inventory management and with the assistance of our dynamic pricing tool, we ended the quarter with 1248 completed, unsold home, which is just under one home per community. This is a decrease from 1.2 homes per community in the prior year and 1.1 homes per community in the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, our home sites owned and controlled were 262,000, of which 205,000 are owned and 57,000 are controlled. And finally, the third quarter joint venture land sales and other category had a combined earnings of 800,000 compared to a loss last year of 1.7 million. So turning to financial services, our financial services segment had operating earnings of 56.6 million compared to 39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage operating earnings increased to 33.8 million from 32.5 million in the prior year. Originations increased to 3 billion from $2.2 billion and 97% of originations were from purchased business, while only 3% were from refis. As we've noted for a while, this drop in refis has led to a very competitive market and is leading to lower profit per loan originated. Our capture rate was 71%, combined Lennar and CalAtlantic versus 80% in the prior year, Lennar only. Historically, CalAtlantic’s capture rate was lower than Lennar’s, so we should see continued improvement in our combined rate, as we capture more of that business. Total operating earnings increased to 22.1 million from 15.6 million in the prior year. The increase again of course was due to the addition of CalAtlantic closings and a higher mix of purchase business with higher transaction values versus the prior year. In the third quarter, our multifamily segment had an operating loss of 3.9 million compared to operating earnings of 9.1 million in the prior year. In the current quarter, we recorded 1.7 million of equity and earnings from the sale of one operating property as well as 5.1 million of promote revenue related to two properties and our LMV fund. In the prior year, we had 15.4 million of equity and earnings from sale of two operating properties and no promote revenue was recorded. As we've noted for a while, we have been moving from a built to sell to a built to hold platform, earning fees and promotes, while creating value within our fund. We ended the quarter with 22 completed and operating properties and 28 under construction, four of which are in lease up, tolling approximately 14,800 apartments with a total development cost of approximately 4.9 billion. Including these communities, we have a total diversified development pipeline of over $10 billion and over 26,000 apartments. And then turning to Rialto, our Rialto segment had operating earnings of 10.7 million compared to 3.2 million in the prior year and both of those amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The details of this segment’s businesses are as follows. The investment management business contributed 31.4 million of earnings, primarily driven by 19.8 million of management fees. Rialto mortgage finance business contributed 517 million of commercial loans into fixed securitizations, resulting in earnings of 9.2 million before their G&A.  The team continues to perform exceedingly well in a highly competitive commercial loan market. Direct investments had a loss of 7 million, as we continue to work through the remaining assets from the bank portfolios and G&A expenses were 23 million.  Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with 833 million of cash. During the quarter, we had continued success with our focus on de-leveraging. We repaid $250 million of 6.95 senior notes, using available cash, not refinanced and reduced the borrowings on our revolving credit facility by 300 million. And as Stuart mentioned, at quarter end, our homebuilding debt to total cap was 40.1% and 37.9% on a net basis. Stockholders’ equity increased to 14 billion and our book value per share grew $42.48 per share. And lastly, during the quarter, we were pleased to achieve an upgrade from Fitch to investment grade. And then turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter, starting with home building, we are adjusting both our deliveries and new order guidance, primarily to reflect the impact of Hurricane Florence and also to reflect the sluggishness that we are currently seeing in the market. We are adjusting our Q4 delivery guidance to 14,500 and adjusting our Q4 new orders guidance to 11,400.  We expect our ending community count to be approximately 1,330. We expect our Q4 average sales price to be about 420,000. We are maintaining our Q4 gross margin guidance of 22.5% to 22.75%, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and we still expect to record about 50 million in Q4 related to return of that write-up of backlog and construction in progress.  We believe our Q4 SG&A percent will be approximately 8% to 8.1% and for the combined category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect Q4 earnings to be about 20 million. We are adjusting our Q4 earnings for financial services to about 57 million, which also reflects the change in deliveries, as noted above. And for multifamily, we're maintaining our Q4 guidance of approximately 35 million. And for Rialto, we expect Q4 earnings to be about $5 million, which is a decrease from previous guidance. We have shifted a sale of a strategic balance sheet investment from Q4 to 2019 because the investment has continued to appreciate and we therefore believe that a 2019 monetization will result in a higher return. We expect Q4 corporate G&A to be about 1.5% of total revenues and we believe we will still have a small amount of continuing integration costs of about 15 million. Our tax rate is expected to be about 24% and the weighted average share count should be about 330 million shares. So as you put the components of our guidance together, we believe our Q4 EPS, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and integration costs should be approximately $2.06. This is a slight decrease from the range previously provided. As mentioned, due to the impact of Hurricane Florence and to reflect a bit of sluggishness in today's markets. Finally, you might remember that when we announced the CalAtlantic application, we noted that we would provide preliminary guidance for our core homebuilding business for fiscal 2019 on this call. So, as we think about deliveries, we expect to deliver approximately 53,000 homes in fiscal 2019. This would be an increase of about 15% from forecasted deliveries in 2018 and an 8% increase in pro forma deliveries for 2018. This is consistent with our previously stated strategic growth range of 7% to 10%. We believe our gross margins will be in the range of 21.75% to 22%, as we continue to move in the direction of optioning more land and producing higher returns. We expect our SG&A to be about 8.4%, as we continue to drive efficiencies in our operations. So in conclusion, with those goals in mind, we're well positioned to deliver another strong and profitable year in ’18 and look forward to a great 2019. And now, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI.
Stephen Kim: Thanks for all the commentary and the guidance and good job on the quarter. I do want to ask you a little bit about the land agreements you’ve struck with the three regional developers. You mentioned, I'm trying to get a sense for what is really different between what you've done here versus what you have done on an ongoing basis in your history. You indicated there’s exclusive assets, I guess to the 55,000 homes sites, but you didn't mention anything about the terms as far as I heard and I was curious if you've given any guarantees, if you could talk a little bit about what the timing of the cash flows might be in terms of the amount of deposits you put down and other things like that that might be relevant to helping us frame how these arrangements might be a bit different from what you've done in the past?
Rick Beckwitt: So Steve, it’s Rick. At this point, we're not going to get into a lot of the details associated with those agreements, because they're confidential at this point. And -- but I can tell you, there are no guarantees. These are very strategic, well-crafted structures that really guarantee us pipeline that these guys develop. And I can't go into a lot of the details at this point. As we move forward, we’ll give you a little bit more color as to what the structure of the deals are, but it's confidential at this point and for competitive reasons I don't want to get into it.
Stuart Miller: But, the two things I would note Steve are, this is the beginning of the reflection of using size and scale in local markets to be able to comfortably absorb what some of the better developers are bringing in their pipeline to market. And it is also reflective of ours -- continuation of our soft pivot to migrate towards fewer home sites purchased for longer period of times on book and using strength and relationship with proven actors in the land market to have more of a just-in-time delivery system for home sites with a greater focus on returns on assets.
Jon Jaffe: Steve, this is Jon. One other thought on this, and I've talked about it, it's really another reflection of our position where we have dominant market share of being the builder of choice for land developers. So they know and they've discussed with us that we're going to be the dominant buyer of their land and so it's getting ahead of that and figuring out a structure that allows us to control what they'll be delivering in the future for them to know that their pipeline will be absorbed by us in a structure that creates a true win-win situation along the lines of what Stuart and Rick described.
Stephen Kim: Yeah. Sure. It absolutely makes sense. Well, great, well, we look forward to getting more info on that as it comes. I guess my second question related to the guidance you gave and in particular, Diane, I think, you had mentioned a gross margin number, 21.75% to 22%. And earlier, Jon had mentioned about, I think, 70 basis point benefit roughly, given the $3,000 benefit in the first and second quarters from lumber. I was curious to what degree your guidance of 21.75% to 22% incorporates an assumption that the lumber prices remain where they are for the remainder of next year, if you could give us some sense of what kind of lumber contribution is embedded in that guidance?  And also, if there is -- I was a little surprised that you mentioned that the option strategy was going to be manifested in the gross margin next year. I was a little surprised that it would happened that quickly, so maybe if you could just kind of elaborate on why the -- why you call that one out as a driver to the gross margin being a little lower than it otherwise would've been.
Stuart Miller: Let me start here, Steve. I think Rick wants to chime in after, but let me just say that, one of the -- we've not generally given guidance for the next year until the fourth quarter. So, one of the problems with getting out a little bit farther ahead and we do want to give guidance and give some direction, as the combination has brought some increased question or discussion around where we're going. But those numbers are moving around a little bit, so you very accurately highlight the flow through of the lumber numbers and how a migration towards more options might flow through those numbers. Right now, it's an imperfect calculation and so we’ll refine those numbers as we go forward, but directionally, we wanted to give you a fairly decent understanding of where we see ourselves headed, given current market conditions and given a best assessment of what we see for the next year. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. And I guess in addition to that, the soft pivot strategy has been going on for several quarters now. We have -- we mentioned on prior calls that as we utilize more third party retail option type structures that the gross margin associated with that is a much lower margin, but a higher IRR. So, you're starting to see some of that kick in in 2019. In addition, the deals that I outlined included with them, a immediate position in the portfolio that these guys are developing. So it's not that's just the future deals, it's their current pipeline. So that's why we’ve put in about 25 bps of margin differential from where we were prior.
Operator: We have a question coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut: First question, I just wanted to get a sense a little bit on your comments around some of the slowdown that occurred during the quarter, as you looked at your order trends. I don't know if there's an ability to kind of give us a sense of the organic growth, how that tracked throughout the quarter, if there's a sense of month to month of the 11%, was it stronger in the first month or two and below that rate in the last month. And also, if I just heard correctly that you expect the orders for 4Q to be 11,400. I think that was only a 200 unit decrease, which seems relatively mild.
Rick Beckwitt: So let's just talk about the quarter. I think we saw sequential improvement month to month throughout the quarter. And when you're talking about whether it's organic or not organic, we're comparing to pro forma numbers. So organic -- it was all organic. With regard to the Q4 lowering of a couple of hundred home -- new order on the home site, that's a contribution of some homes having slipped because of the storm, the hurricane into Q4 that we lost in Q3, but also some delay associated with the storm going forward. So it's, I think, what we feel relatively positive about the market, as Stuart and Jon said, the market has paused a little bit, but we're seeing consistent normalized demand.
Jon Jaffe: If you think about Michael, in some of the markets, as I articulated, when you're at a pace above five sales per community per month, that's really not sustainable. You're going to run into resistance at some point and where it has shifted to is a very normal rate. In some cases, above that level for that one a week that we sort of strive for as ideal in many of our markets. So, there is – on a relative basis, right, a slowing, but when you step back and look at it, it's a very healthy, sustainable rate that we're at right now.
Michael Rehaut: No, no. I appreciate that Jon. I guess secondly, and I realize, Stuart, as you said, it's kind of an early number and probably you will be sharpening the pencil perhaps over the next three months ahead of your 4Q call. But I think a lot of people will be focusing, as Steve before was asking around the 2019 gross margin number. And I think it was helpful, I believe, Rick that you mentioned that perhaps the higher level of optioning might be a 25 bp headwind. You also have an expected roughly 100 bp tailwind from increased synergies, that roughly 220 million as well as some tailwind from lumber. So the offsetting headwind I guess is what I'm trying to get my head around, when you think about the fact that 2018 will be 22% or a little bit below 22% gross margin ex purchase accounting if I have that math right. Where is the other offset? Is it mix? Is it higher priced land coming through? The difference more perhaps, either -- again mix being either geographic or demographic, any help there would be helpful?
Jon Jaffe: Michael, it’s Jon. Relative to gross margin, mix it not the major driver there, but we do see that we’re in an environment where it's constrained relative to land and labor. So, you do have year-over-year flowing through higher land cost and higher direct construction costs. So with Lennar, you have a story of what's happened in the marketplace relative to that constraint, offset by synergy savings to marketplace benefit of what's happening with lumber that will show up in the first half of next year. So you have, as you know, both headwinds and tailwinds. So I’m balancing as we forecast a long time ago, we felt that post-merger would be around 22% gross margins with the benefit of the synergies. And so I think you see all of those components, both headwinds and tailwinds reflecting in that preliminary guidance that we gave.
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Schrier of Citi.
Scott Schrier: I appreciate all the color that you gave earlier in the call regarding California. I'm just curious if I can dig a little bit deeper into it, obviously, your ASP growth there was exceptional. Can you speak to the role that mix had there? And then if you're talking about how you had this temporary slowdown, you had absorption slow, is some of the reason there behind tax and if so, when you expect this to pick up again, do you expect to pick it up again after absorptions pick up again at the expense of ASP growth or do you look at this as sustainable.
Stuart Miller: There's not a one size fits all answer to that. In some cases, the ASP change is mix, as I tried to highlight in that Orange County example. And in many -- most cases, it's really just price appreciation in local markets, market like Seattle that's been driven by tremendous job growth. You just had year-over-year price acceleration, in the Bay Area, with the boom in the tech world, you've seen year-over-year price appreciation. So, you have both things going on, but more price appreciation than mix. As far as being able to look forward and predict when we'll see pace increase, that's very hard to do. What we see is we see demand, we see people with lot of interest, we see people pausing as we all have said and just not having the urgency to buy now. So we don't want to suggest that people have left the marketplace or have lost interest in purchasing. It's more that they're stepping back and as we've seen in past market cycles, adjusting to new pricing, which results in a higher monthly mortgage payment. And if people adjust to that, we expect that they'll come back in to the marketplace.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. Embedded in your question, you asked about the tax effect and I think that as we look at the market right now and take its temperature, I think that we would say that you're seeing more impact from just price and interest rate migration and adjustment to where the market has gone than any discernible connection between a lack of demand or change in demand pattern, relative to where tax rates have moved and any impact in California, we just haven't seen that yet, not in our price ranges.
Scott Schrier: And just for my follow up, I'd like to round out that discussion on some of your other main areas, if you could just talk about absorption trends, directionally in areas like Texas and Florida that would be great.
Rick Beckwitt: So, if you look at our other major markets, which are really Texas and Florida, I would tell you that we had strong performance in those markets. Texas was up significantly year-over-year, almost 20% in new orders as a whole state. We look at Florida, the Florida markets continue to be robust. That said, there are, in the Dallas market, at the higher, the price points that market has gotten a little bit softer, but really across the board, it's your sub $3000 in price point, it's a very strong market. And we saw continued strengthen in Florida, so you know pretty much across the board, other than on the West Coast, where there was a little bit of softness, as prices have increased dramatically, we feel that we're in a relatively normalized market right now.
Operator: And our next question is from Stephen East of Wells Fargo.
Paul Przybylski: Actually, this is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. Considering the new demand environment, is your focus more on orders or margin and as kind of have this pause, do you think the industry is maybe protecting that backlog right now and the stock has continued until the fourth quarter that we may actually see industry move to even higher incentives?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, as you saw during the quarter, we really didn't increase the incentives for Q3. We’re very focused on converting our backlog into revenue. As we do, we're focused every quarter and as we run the business, as we talk about in the past, we are constantly balancing sales pace and margin. There are dynamic pricing models that Jon has really led the company.
Jon Jaffe: Yeah. As we've talked before, it's really a market by market, community by community analysis, relative to price and pace and we make that decision very, very locally. And with respect to backlog, we're not talking about a market shift that would cause us or any other builder, I think, to be concerned about their backlog. What we're talking about is just a market that has, on a relative basis, shifted from very strong to more normalized paced in the cases that we're talking about. 
Stuart Miller: Let me circle back to something that I highlighted in my comments, because I think it is kind of a direct answer to the question, which is our view is that the market has kind of reacted to price and rates having moved fairly dramatically over the past quarters and years. But we go back and we constantly look at the production pace that we've seen over the past years. The constraint of land and labor that is well documented that has narrowed the funnel through which supply shortage could be addressed and can be addressed and we look at the normalized demand level for the country and though some might argue that 1.5 million isn't the same as it used to be, we've been producing at a significantly lower level for the better part of the past decade.  So we've been building pent up demand. I think our view and I think generally the industry view is that embedded in these numbers, there is a demand pattern and basic economic strength underlying it that will help correct and drive the market forward. So I would say, pretty aggressively that we're not protecting backlog and certainly nothing reflective of what we've seen in past cycles. Instead, I think there's a pause. I think, there's a catch up and I think that will, with economic drivers driving forward, see a resumption of or a normalization of the patterns going forward.
Paul Przybylski: And just as a follow-up on the integration or synergy savings, you're referring that? Are there any risks or upside potential you see moving forward?
Rick Beckwitt: We feel, as I said, pretty comfortable. We have a lot of clarity to the synergies that we've identified. There's a lot of work to do to realize them, but we've seen that come into place relative to 2018 as we're in our last quarter of 2018, we feel that those are very much locked and loaded, agreements are in place with national vendors that will carry it through the full year of 2019. So, I don't see a lot of risk. Is there upside? There's always the potential for upside, as we dig deeper into it and one synergy builds on the next, but for us, the focus is the day-to-day blocking and tackling of executing on what we've identified and making sure that we deliver on that.
Operator: And we have a question from Alan Ratner of Zelman and Associates.
Stuart Miller: Okay. And we’ll make this the last question. Go ahead, Alan.
Alan Ratner: Thanks for squeezing me in here and nice job, given the choppier environment of late. I think, taking a step back, if mid to high single digit growth is bad as it's going to get, it’s certainly not draconian view that the market seems to be expressing right now. But, just as far as what you're seeing as far as the deceleration, is there any notable differences you're seeing across the various price points you build out? I know, you gave the geographic exposure, but any main differences you're seeing across your buyer pools and does that impact how you're thinking about land investment today as far as maybe shifting the portfolio subtly over the next couple of years.
Rick Beckwitt: Well, sort of on a general basis and there are some exceptions. At the higher price points, it's gotten a little bit softer than the lower price points had been. And that's not unusual in a market that there's a lot of publicity as to what's going on in mortgage rates and price appreciation, because the more fluent buyer time their purchase based on where they think the world is going. And so, we think, as we said consistently that this is just a market adjustment to a more normalized market from what was really a red hot market in some of these markets.  With regard to land and our land strategy, we have consistently said for the last year that we've been shifting a lot of our land investment to the entry level and that first time move up buyer, because it's the fat of the market and our teams have been focused on making investments in that area.
Alan Ratner: And then, I think on the capital allocation side, you mention share repurchase activity potential, which I think makes a lot of sense at the current levels. One thing I don't think you mentioned was the possibility of more M&A and I know while it's no fun to see stock prices go down, you guys have historically been very opportunistic on the M&A front during periods of disruption in the equity markets. So, just kind of curious how you're thinking about the possibility of doing another deal, now that the CalAtlantic integration is behind you and are there any interesting opportunities, either public or private, starting to pop up now, given some of the pullback in the share prices.
Rick Beckwitt: Well, Alan, as you can imagine, we probably won't comment too deeply on the answer to that question, but you know us. Number one, everything is on the table and from our company's perspective, we love a bargain, we're very opportunistic and always have been, we're always focused on competing alternatives. We are -- we have highlighted that we've been very cash flow focused. We've really positioned our balance sheet very well. Diane's done a great job of managing our capital allocation and programming to date. We sit with an excellent balance sheet in just a short time after completing a transaction and integration complete, it really positions us to look at organic growth, at M&A, should there be unique opportunities, but everything measured against the most obvious bargain, which is the group of assets that we know best, the group of assets that we control, the least form of friction and that is buying back stock. So as we sit here today, and we look at the capital markets, not enamored with the home building sector, as we look at the landscape with the growth rates as we see them today and the production deficit as we see that -- as we see it today and as tomorrow we have our board meeting and we sit and talk to our board for advice, very much on the table is the question of allocating capital in balance between paying down debt and buying back stock as against some of those other alternatives. So never think for a minute that anything is off the table with Lennar. We love a good bargain and this is an environment where you start to find them.
Rick Beckwitt: Okay. So with that, we'll wrap up. Thanks for joining us and we look forward to updating again for our fourth quarter and into 2019. Thank you everyone.
Operator: Thank you and that concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-06-26 11:00:00) =====

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, Executive Chairman. Sir, you may now begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you, Alex. And let me say that I am here this morning with some brand new people. I am here with Rick Beckwitt, our Chief Executive Officer; Jon Jaffe, our President; and Diane Bessette, our Chief Financial Officer among others. And let me go ahead and start and say that I am going to give a general overview as I always have. Rick and Jon will then give the real operational overview and Diane will deliver further detail on the numbers. It’s hard to believe, but this is our first full quarter conference call as a combined Lennar CalAtlantic platform, so we have a lot of ground to cover. Jon and Rick will give a comprehensive update on our now combined operations and progress on synergies and Diane will give detail on how purchased accounting has affected our results and reconcile our quarterly results to our guidance and to consensus expectations. When we get to Q&A, as always I would like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that our excellent quarterly results derived from a great deal of hard work that’s been done both in our division offices and here in the corporate office. I said it last quarter and I am going to say it again, it all comes down to a great team of professionals coming together and working cooperatively. From the people here in this room with me today to the many throughout the Lennar offices, we are thankful for their hard, diligent and focused work. Because of the manner in which our team has worked and grown through this acquisition, I have continued to become increasingly enthusiastic about the evolving position of our company as a leader in the homebuilding industry. We are not only well-positioned to execute on our current operational strategies, but we have become ever more adaptable and nimble adjusting to the changing landscapes around us. As a management team, we believe that we are excellently structured and positioned to continue to grow our business, while we leverage scale in each of our markets to drive efficiencies and implement new technologies to enhance our operating platform. Overall, the housing market has remained strong and seems to continue to strengthen. Even with questions about rising interest rates, labor shortages, rising construction costs and the macro international trade tensions, the housing market has remained resilient. There continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market. Unemployment is at historic lows. The labor participation rate is increasing and wages are higher. Consumers in our welcome home centers confirm that the dual income producing family is resurgent and they feel confident, because economic conditions have remained strong and stable and/or improving. The deficit in the production of new homes that has existed since the market crash has driven a serious supply shortage, while demand is strong. The millennial population is forming households and having children, so short supply with strong demand is sustaining this recovery and overcoming headwinds. And since land and labor shortages are limiting affordable production, it will still take some time. It will still take some years to get to equilibrium. The Federal Tax Act continues to add additional momentum to the economic and housing landscape, while many continue to express concerns about the effect of the tax law on housing, it is proving to be a positive to the wallet of our customer base and stimulative to the economy overall, which is good for housing. Accordingly, with strong management focus and execution, one can see that we have not missed a beat. We have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed expectations this quarter and we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year. Before I turn over to Rick and Jon, let me make a few short strategic notes. First, 42.4%, that’s our debt to total capitalization at the end of the second quarter. Our net debt to total cap is 40%. As noted in our press release, we have used strong cash flow to start paying down debt and rightsizing our balance sheet. We paid down $825 million of higher interest rate notes plus the remaining $250 million of Rialto notes and we did it out of strong cash flow and without refinance. We will remain focused on the reduction of debt and will continue to drive strong cash flow as we look to the future. Next, the pay-down of Rialto’s remaining outstanding debt paves the way to a seamless repositioning of that enterprise. As noted in our last conference call, we have engaged Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo to consider the proper strategic alternatives for Rialto’s future. We have begun a formal process for that consideration and we will give public update as warranted. We noted last quarter a timeframe of approximately 12 months from then to conclude this process. While I don’t have further updates on the Rialto process at this time, we remain committed to our strategy of reverting to our pure-play core homebuilding platform. Finally, some have noted with interest our recent reinvestment in Open Door, a leading technology company that automates the valuation of homes and executes purchase offers to customers at those values. Open Door is simply taking the friction out of the home transaction. We first invested in the Open Door platform, 1.5 years ago. We believed that Open Door’s strategy of reducing friction in the home sale market would be transformational to the industry, while very compatible with our new home homebuilding strategy. Many interested Lennar customers come to our welcome home centers with a home to sell. Open Door is there to help. Additionally, many customers outgrow their first home as their families grow, Open Door is there to help. Some potential Lennar customers postpone the move-up purchase, because engaging the broker and showing their home over months is a dreaded experience, Open Door is there to help. Just like selling a used car used to strike fear in the potential new car buyers, selling a used home causes procrastination in the potential move-up purchaser and Open Door is there to help. Lennar invested in the Open Door opportunity to alleviate the stress and friction embedded in our transaction. We believed in the concept, we underwrote the capability of the management team and we concluded that together Lennar and Open Door could make serious changes to our industry as well as to our customer interface and could drive cost as well as friction out of the way that people buy and sell homes. To-date, this partnership has worked exceptionally well and it’s getting better and expanding to more markets. Lennar is selling more homes enabled by the Open Door program. We are accommodating customers who come to us with a home to sell and we are also reaching out to existing first-time homeowners with a growing family and enabling them to avoid the friction and the aggravation and purchase of move-up homes, with the rooms they need, the space they want and the new home technologies they crave. Open Door benefits from our managerial and operational experience and we benefit from their technology and innovative approach to the home sales market. This Open Door story is a proxy for Lennar’s technology strategy. We look for ideas that can work and enhance our customers experience while building a better business platform. There is no hype, just execution. We look for great technology management teams that can execute on technology platforms that we don’t have the talent or the resource to develop. We invest and then we have let our formidable scale and management guidance enable the business to adapt and to grow. We get better and they get better. Open Door is not our only technology initiative. We have now worked with the talented management teams of Blend the digital mortgage platform notarized the digital notary company and Blueprint, the energy network company, among others. These are not investments that are part of the strategy. We are investing in technologies and tech teams that can change our industry and enhance our company’s execution. We are simply building a better mousetrap. So with that said, let me conclude where I started. It really all comes down to people. People make the trains run on time. Sales, starts, closings and margins, it’s the people. People focus on cash flow and right-size the balance sheet. People find the strategic directions for ancillary businesses and revert to core. People find new technologies and they adapt and change and incorporate them into old school companies. People execute and we have great people and great teams and I am proud to be a part of this team. We have accomplished a great deal and have a lot of exciting work ahead of us. It’s the people that have and will make the difference and I once again thanked the associates across our platform, our operating platforms for their diligence and their expertise. Because of them, I can comfortably say that our company, Lennar, is well-prepared to continue to execute. So with that, let me turn over to Rick and Jon.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. Let me quickly start by summarizing our results in the second quarter and then Jon and I will update you on the CalAtlantic integration. Net earnings for the quarter totaled $310 million, up 45% from 2017. Our core homebuilding operations really produced. New orders for the quarter totaled 14,440 homes, up 62% from the prior year, with the dollar value of approximately $6 billion, representing a 79% increase. We delivered 12,095 homes in the quarter, which was up 57% from 2017. Revenues in the quarter totaled $5.5 billion, representing a 67% increase. We ended the quarter with a solid sales backlog of 19,622 homes, with a dollar value of $8.6 billion, up 92% and 114% respectively from 2017. Our gross margin, excluding the backlog and construction in progress write-up, totaled 21.6%, which was the top of the range we guided to last quarter. Finally, our SG&A in the quarter was 8.7%. This marks an all-time second quarter low, significantly lower than our prior guidance and highlights the power of our increased geographic scale and our operating leverage. These results were achieved by a lot of hard work from our associates across the country driving our day-to-day business and focused on the CalAtlantic integration. I can’t think of our associates enough for everything they have accomplished. While these numbers demonstrate the success of our integration, let me give you some additional color on where we stand. Operationally, CalAtlantic is fully integrated into Lennar and we are operating as one company. This transition has proceeded smoothly and we are well ahead of schedule. More importantly, we are now realizing the true operating synergies stemming from our new local and national market scale. As I highlighted last quarter, our homebuilding operation has 5 regions and 38 divisions with operations in 49 markets. Prior to the merger, CalAtlantic had 4 regions and 27 divisions, with operations in 43 markets. Two of the CalAtlantic divisions were new markets to Lennar and continue today. The remaining 25 divisions have been combined with the Lennar divisions resulting in significant SG&A savings. Operationally, we have been able to maintain or increase our market share, reduce cycle time and increased absorption, while reducing headcount by approximately 33%. We also eliminated 5 corporate and regional offices, 21 homebuilding division offices, 18 design centers, 24 financial services branches and 1 financial services processing center. The transition from the CalAtlantic design center program to the Everything’s Included program has been impressive and is reducing cycle times and construction cost. Excluding the CalAtlantic closeout communities, 207 communities have been converted to Lennar products, 136 communities have continued with CalAtlantic products, but converted to an Everything’s Included products and the remaining 30 communities are continuing with an option-light CalAtlantic product. Our intense focus on product conversion is really showing its benefits and reduced cycle times. On average, we are saving approximately 30 to 40 days by converting the CalAtlantic product to Lennar product and approximately 25 to 30 days by converting the CalAtlantic design center products to an Everything’s Included product. Jon will highlight the significant cost savings and increased access to trades we are seeing from this conversion. Keep in mind that we are now the number one builder in 20 markets and a top three builder in 32 markets and that our market share in our number one markets range between 21% and 43%, with an average share of approximately 30%. This critical mass will continue to increase our operating leverage. We just are seeing the beginning of our leverage in the last quarter. This market share has significantly increased our access to land. Simply put, landowners and developers are finding that they both want and need us in their community. With this in mind, we have met with many leading developers and third-party capital sources to explore new mutually beneficial structures. On the technology side and the systems side, we are making good progress on our homebuilding system migration and we will be completing two more divisions this week. We are on track to be migrating 2 to 3 divisions each week for the next few months until completed. We have also completed the system migration for our financial services operation and now are currently writing all mortgages out of our Eagle mortgage operation. We are already seeing the benefits of this capture rate from the legacy CalAtlantic communities where we have increased capture rate from 60% to approximately 80% and we feel that there is increased opportunity over the entire platform given our larger scale. Now, I’d like to turn it over to Jon.
Jon Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. I’d like to bring you up-to-date on where we are with our focus on cost synergies. On last quarter’s call, we communicated that we expect to exceed our synergy’s target of $100 million for fiscal year ‘18 by $25 million. I am pleased to report that we are now on track to exceed that target by an additional $35 million for total fiscal year 2018 synergies of $160 million. For fiscal year 2019, we are now on track to exceed our $365 million target by $10 million for a total of $380 million. Approximately, $160 million of expected savings for 2018 breaks down to about $80 million for corporate expenses and SG&A savings and $80 million for direct construction cost savings. For the corporate expenses and SG&A savings, we have locked in about $80 million of synergies that’s made up of the following categories. Corporate G&A represents about $35 million made up of executive and administrative compensation, along with public company expenses. Operational SG&A savings of about $45 million are from the reduction in associate headcount in the regions and divisions, along with the closing of offices that Rick highlighted. We now estimate that 2019 annual run-rate for these overhead savings at $115 million exceeding our target of $100 million for 2019. Becoming the builder of choice for national manufacturers, suppliers and local trades, it’s a key to achieving our direct construction cost synergies. We have now identified approximately $80 million of savings for 2018 exceeding the increased target of $65 million we gave you last quarter. Our significant market scale, combined with our efficient Everything’s Included platform, are very big drivers of these savings. Additionally, our intense focus on even flow production, jobsite readiness, cycle span accuracy and dynamic pricing all enhance our relationships with our trade partners increasing the number of bids we received for our work. Last quarter, I spoke about kicking off our cost synergy workshops. We have now conducted workshops at 23 divisions. The key areas of focus at the workshops are value engineering, takeoff verification and leveraging our increased scale. We identify, validate and collect cost synergies across all labor and material categories as well as improve building practices. We also evaluate every opportunity to improve utilization of our national supplier programs to increase the rebate opportunity. The information from each workshop is compiled for tracking our execution and then shared with all other Lennar division. Through this process, we are able to add quickly on opportunities identified in any one of our divisions across our entire platform. I feel strongly that these workshops, which involve our national supply chain team, our regional purchasing teams and our division management teams are the key to driving our ability to meet and exceed our direct cost saving or direct cost synergy plans. The 23 divisions that have completed a workshop are all above their respective synergy targets demonstrating the effectiveness of this process. Let me briefly describe the top 5 categories driving our division synergy plans for 2019. Plans and specification changes will total about $50 million of savings. We select lower cost home plans and overall specification rightsizing as identified at our workshops. Value engineering at the workshops for framing and lumber, along with leveraging our local scale for this category with our trade partners will represent over $30 million of savings. For drywall, flooring and HVAC, we will save around $10 million in each of these categories through our national programs and leveraging our local scale with the trades. Given our progress in these and other categories, we are on track to meet or exceed our 2019 target of $265 million of direct construction cost synergies. We expect to accomplish this despite the backdrop of serious industry headwinds of a tight labor market, elevated lumber prices and international trade tariffs. We do not expect to see any softening in the labor supply, especially with the current political environment on immigration. Here our success in being the Builder of Choice with the trades gives us a strategic operating advantage as we attract more trades to bid our work. We now see approximately 5 to 6 bids as compared to 2 to 3 bids for most trade categories. We believe lumber, which is at an all-time high of over $600 per thousand board feet has peaked and expect to see some softening as more lumber inventories freed up due to increased availability of transportation. With respect to tariffs, we are protected on most of our national contracts, where we have seen some impact as with products like rebar in markets that are dependent upon foundation still, this increase in rebar can be a few hundred dollars per home. To a lesser extent, there are some minor increases in products such as garage doors, screws and nails. As I did last quarter, I want to highlight Lennar’s quarterly operations review. This is the process that pulls together all of the pieces. Here Rick or I and sometimes Stuart, along with the regional presidents, the regional operations controller and the division management team address all aspects of our business. We cover merger-related issues, associated, customers, trade partners, land plan financials and more. These sessions keep us connected and on track to accomplish our goals. I also want to thank our incredible associates and our first full quarter as a merge company they tackled the challenges of the integration while exceeding all of our second quarter expectations. Their dedication, hard work and focus inspire us all. I would also like to thank our trade partners from manufacturers and suppliers to the local trades. The open discussions and resulting agreements on how to improve both of our businesses are clear evidence of the effectiveness of this merger. With that, I would like to turn it over to Diane.
Diane Bessette: Thank you, Jon and good morning to everyone. Before I provide the details of our second quarter results, let me give a simple analysis of our numbers as compared to consensus to assist in understanding some of the noise in the quarter. Our reported EPS is $0.94 and the average of all analyst estimates is $0.41. The difference is $0.53. This difference of $0.53 can be separated into two categories: first, non-operating items, representing $0.35 of the difference and second, operating items representing $0.18 of the difference. This $0.18 is our operating feet or our outperformance as you compare expectations to actual results. So, let me give you the details of the two categories starting with the non-operating items. There are three distinct components to this category. The first item is the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The expectation for Q2 was to record approximately $350 million of write-up. The actual amount recorded was approximately $240 million. The difference between these two amounts is just timing and will flow through in subsequent quarters. The total amount of write-up for fiscal 2018 is approximately the same. The second item is integration costs such as severance and lease termination. The expectation for Q2 cost was $29 million and the actual costs were just $24 million. The third item is tax rate. The expected Q2 tax rate was 24% and the actual tax rate was 19.7%. The difference relates to the impacts of energy credits that were taken in the quarter. Now, let me turn to the operating items category. The difference between expectations and actual results relate to the increase in Q2 deliveries, average sales price and operating margins or as I previously stated this is our operating out-performance. So with that backdrop, let me walk you through the details of our second quarter results starting with homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 74% in the second quarter driven by a 57% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and an 11% increase in average sales price to $413,000. Both of these increases were primarily a result of the CalAtlantic acquisition. As Rick noted, our second quarter gross margin on home sales was 21.6%, excluding the CalAtlantic purchase accounting write-up of backlog and construction in progress. The prior year’s gross margin percent was 21.5% and gross margins in the second quarter were highest in our homebuilding U.S. segment. And just a few comments about our second quarter gross margins. Sales incentives improved 40 basis points to 5.3% from 5.7% and direct construction costs were up about 7% to $59.64 per square foot driven by a 7% increase in labor and an 8% increase in material costs. Also as Rick noted, our second quarter SG&A percent was 8.7%, which was the lowest Q2 SG&A in the company’s history compared to 9.3% in the prior year. The improvement was due to improved operating leverage as Rick details as well as continued benefit from our technology initiatives. So as a result of the above noted gross margin and SG&A percent, our second quarter operating margin was 12.9%, excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress compared to 12.1% in the prior year. We opened 163 new communities during the second quarter and closed 182 communities to end the quarter with 1,325 net active communities. New orders increased 62% and the new order dollar value increased 79% again primarily as a result of CalAtlantic. As we highlighted on our last conference call, during the second quarter, where we were transitioning CalAtlantic products, we expected our sales pace to be about 3.4%. However we exceeded that expectation with an actual sales pace of 3.6%. Our completed unsold homes were 1,478 homes at quarter end, which is roughly about 1 home per community. This is a decrease from about 1.5 homes per community in the prior year. During the second quarter, we purchased 9,600 home sites totaling $692 million and have land development spend of $557 million. Our home sites owned and controlled were 261,000, of which 195,000 are owned and 66,000 are controlled. And finally, the second quarter joint venture land sale and other category had a combined $17.9 million of earnings compared to a loss last year of $15.9 million primarily driven by the profitability of two strategic land sales. And then turning to financial services, in our second quarter, our financial services segment had operating earnings of $52.4 million compared to $43.7 million in the prior year. Mortgage operating earnings increased to $34.7 million from $32 million in the prior year. Originations increased to $2.9 billion from $2.3 billion, 96% of originations are now from purchase business, while only 4% are from refis. As we have noted for a while, this drop in refis has led to a very competitive market that is going after purchase business and is leading to lower profit per loan originated. We went live on April 1 with a new digital mortgage platform for the combined company using a mortgage application technology from Blend. The platform is already being used in 77% of our mortgage applications. The results have shown a several day reductions in the mortgage process and have streamlined improved customer experience. Total operating earnings increased to $16.4 million from $9.7 million in the prior year. The increase was due to the addition of CalAtlantic closings and a higher mix of purchase business with higher transaction values versus the prior year. And then turning to multifamily, in the second quarter, our multifamily segment had operating earnings of $14.8 million compared to $6.5 million in the prior year. The earnings were primarily driven by $17.4 million from the sale of two operating properties as well as $5.2 million of promote revenue related to two properties in our LMV Fund I. We ended the quarter with 19 completed and operating properties and 31 under construction, 7 of which are leased up totaling approximately 14,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.9 billion. Including these communities, we have a total diversified development pipeline of approximately $9.5 billion in over 25,000 apartments. And then turning to Rialto, in the second quarter, Rialto had operating earnings of $7 million compared to $6.2 million in the prior year and both of those amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The details of the segment businesses are as follows. The investment management business contributed $30.3 million of earnings primarily driven by $18.7 million of management fees. Rialto Mortgage Finance business contributed $209 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $8.7 million before their G&A expenses. Direct investments had a loss of $7.5 million as we monetized the remaining assets from the bank portfolios and G&A and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, were $24.5 million and benefited from the retirement of Rialto’s $350 million, 7% senior notes. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 19.7%. The rate is lower than prior year of $33.8 million primarily due to a lower federal tax rate and as previously mentioned the impact of new energy efficient home credits that were extended to be available for homes closed in 2017. And then turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $932 million of cash. And as Stuart mentioned, during the quarter, we repaid $575 million of 8.38% CalAtlantic senior notes using homebuilding cash. As a result, net debt to total cap was 40%. During the quarter, we also paid off the remaining $250 million of Rialto’s 7% senior notes and on June 1 we repaid $250 million of 6.9% Lennar senior notes also using homebuilding cash, thus a total reduction of $1.1 billion. Stockholders’ equity increased to $13.6 billion and our book value per share grew to $41.25 per share. So, now turning to our guidance for the balance of the year starting with homebuilding, for deliveries in new orders, we reaffirm our previous guidance as follows. We expect Q3 deliveries and new orders to be $12,500. We expect Q4 deliveries to be $15,000 and new orders to be $11,600. For our average sales price, we expect Q3 average sales price to be about $410,000 and Q4 about $415,000. For gross margins, we expect Q3 gross margins, excluding write-ups for backlog and construction in progress to be between 21.5% and 21.75% and Q4 gross margins to be between 22.5% and 22.75% given the higher deliveries in that quarter. As previously mentioned, some of the write-ups for backlog and construction in progress have shifted. And so we now expect to record approximately $100 million in Q3 and approximately $50 million in Q4. And for SG&A, we expect Q3 SG&A to be about 8.7% and Q4 about 8.0%, again given the higher deliveries in that quarter. We expect our net community count to end the year at about 1,350. And finally for the combined category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, we expect Q3 to be about breakeven and Q4 earnings of about $8 million. Turning to Financial Services, we expect Q3 earnings to be about $60 million and Q4 earnings between $63 million and $68 million. For multifamily, we expect Q3 to be a slight loss and Q4 to have earnings of about $35 million. And for Rialto, we expect Q3 earnings to be about $15 million and Q4 earnings between $28 million and $38 million. For corporate G&A, we expect to see leverage with the full year at 1.8% of total revenue. For integration costs, we believe that we will have a small amount of continuing integration costs in Q3 and Q4, approximately $10 million in each quarter. For our tax rate, we expect the tax rate for Q3 and for Q4 to be 24%. For share count, the weighted average share count for Q3 and Q4 should be about 330 million shares. And so then looking at EPS, as you put together the components of our guidance, our Q3 EPS excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and integration costs should be in the range of $1.40 to $1.45. This range increases the low end of the range previously provided during our last conference call. And Q4 EPS, again excluding the write-up of backlog and construction in progress and integration costs should be in the range of $2.10 to $2.20. This is also an increase to the low end of the range previously provided. We remain on target with our cash flow generation forecast of $2 billion to $2.5 billion before CalAtlantic related costs, ancillary businesses and debt pay-downs. So, in conclusion with these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong and profitable year in 2018. And now I will turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Rick Beckwitt: Stephen, are you there?
Stephen East: Yes, can you hear me?
Rick Beckwitt: There we go. There we go.
Stephen East: Alright. Congratulations on the quarter. Nice quarter and thanks for all the detail. Start first there is a lot of chatter in our side of the world about slowing demand. I guess we haven’t really seen in our fieldwork other than seasonal slowing looking at your numbers given all the integration with CalAtlantic, it looks like you are not seeing it, but I don’t want to put words in your mouth, so are you seeing any slowdown, anything other than seasonal and if so where are you seeing it and in what type of product?
Jon Jaffe: I think seasonal is exactly the right way to describe it, Steve, this is Jon, across the platform. We are seeing the economic environment of strong job growth, good economy and very low inventory supporting demand as you see in your fieldwork. So, we are definitely seeing the seasonal change. We had a strong spring as evidenced by our second quarter results, but we are not seeing anything that causes us to think otherwise.
Stuart Miller: It goes back to some of my opening remarks, Steve. You are still looking at short supply and a growing demand. It’s very hard to put affordable product on the ground and there is short supply of that in the existing market as well. And I think cutting against some of the headwinds, you just have that production deficit in a growing demand from the millennials that are all coming of that age where they are forming families and demand patterns still seem strong, flies in the face of some of the noise that we hear in the press, but there is a lot of confidence and people are still coming out to buy homes.
Stephen East: Alright, great. And then on the integration savings, I was wondering how long it takes you to bump up the $365 million and it didn’t take you long. So I guess two questions around that. One, does that include as you look out and we continue to see this inflation, is that net of the inflation or is that built into it? And then I guess Jon maybe a little bit more specifically where you are getting if you rank ordered the incremental bumps you are seeing in both ‘18 and ‘19 a little bit more specificity on where that’s coming from?
Jon Jaffe: We talk about the synergy numbers that is from what the marketplace is. So, for example, if lumber went up, but we say $1 a foot and we brought our framing and labor contracts down $0.50, our net might be up $0.50, our synergy is $0.50 if you follow that example. With respect to where we are seeing it, it’s really as I said given a lot of details that come out of ours workshops that deal with perhaps the way a type of lumber for a top plate or the way corner is put together or foundations the way we are working with our framers on some free-cutting of material, panelizing material and putting those panels together, it’s really working across the spectrum of all trades. So, it’s hard to say that it’s all here or there, because you also have geographic differences. So in some markets, we will find we have a bigger opportunity in one category and in another market it will be in a different category.
Stephen East: Got it, okay. On the EI and I know in the field we saw where you are keeping some of the CalAtlantic plans if you will, but you are going to value engineer those, will you get the same type of cost savings from those that you would have gotten from an E&I – from an EI switch?
Rick Beckwitt: In many cases, we will get more cost savings from those. So, I really want to reiterate that most of the CalAtlantic product that we will be continuing to build in the future will be EI and there will be few communities that have a handful of communities that have a modified or lighter option program similar to what we do in Texas with village builders.
Jon Jaffe: As I said, Stephen, in my comments we look at an 1,800 square foot plan for a specific submarket for a specific customer type and we had a Lennar plan and a CalAtlantic plan, we look at which is the lower cost plan to produce that also will satisfy the needs of that market. So, it’s very much a, what’s the best plan, which one is the most cost efficient to build, which one has the best cycle plan.
Stephen East: Okay, thanks a lot and congratulations.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Alan Ratner: Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on all of the very impressive progress and congrats to Rick and Jon and Diane and Bruce if you are in the room as well listening quietly. So, what I wanted to touch on a little bit was your comments on the land front and I know you have the quote in the release and you mentioned in the prepared remarks as well just the momentum and progress you are seeing as far as your conversations with landowners and sellers. And I was hoping to dig in a little bit more on that and really determine exactly what you are seeing there? If I look at your lot count about a quarter of your lots today are controlled through options, so when you are reading between the lines what I think I am hearing is you are expecting to see some progress there moving that number higher. So, I was just curious if there is an internal target or goal there that you are willing to share with us and then kind of connecting the dots there on the cash side very impressive generation and de-leveraging this quarter. I was hoping you could just give us an update on your current thinking on cash generation as well as the timing of debt repurchase and any potential buyback activity as well?
Rick Beckwitt: So, it’s Rick. On the land side, we have an intense focus right now. Jon and I are regional presidents, Stuart we have been all over the country meeting with these key developers to create some pretty interesting structures to increase our activity. What we found is the deals are coming to us right now, because when you have a 20% to 40% market share, you need to be included. And so where there were times in the past, where we had to hunt them down, the hunt is not happening right now. So based on that, what we are trying to do is increase the amount of option business that we can deal, which is a little bit lower margin business, but a higher IRR business and we are engaged in conversations across the country with these leading developers and capital sources to create something that’s special and it’s you will see an increase in our option business that will help our cash position and it’s going to take a little bit of time to do that, but as we move into 2019, you will see some dramatic change.
Alan Ratner: Thanks, Rick. And then just on the cash generation, I think you had given the number of $2 billion for the remainder of the year and I think the current thinking is this year, you are really focused on paying down debt getting to a net debt level similar to where you were before the deal by the end of the year and then ‘19 having some capacity either for some share repurchase activity, additional M&A etcetera. So, is that still kind of the right way to think about that?
Stuart Miller: I think in terms of size and scope the answer is yes. I think we leave optionality open to ourselves in terms of how cash will be deployed particularly as we look ahead numerous quarters. But I think that you can see from the numbers posted today, the cash generation is squarely in the middle of our scope. We are paying down debt at an accelerated rate. We are really pleased that we got through this quarter with the ability to pay down as much as we did without refinance and it sets up the rest of the year, which is even more cash generative. So as we go into next year, I think we will have excess cash and again we leave our options open, but we are going to have a very well crafted balance sheet.
Rick Beckwitt: Alan, just as a point of reference, my good friend, Stuart, made my screensaver our debt maturity ladder and I am trying to figure out how to change it.
Alan Ratner: Got it. Thanks, guys. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Yes, thank you very much guys. Hi, congratulations and boy, so many things to talk about, which I guess is good. I just wanted to follow-up on Alan’s question about land if I could. Rick in your answer to his question about land and your intentions going forward, you use a couple of phrases that are interesting, you said interesting structures trying to create something special and a dramatic change is likely in 2019. So I just want to follow-up on that and trying to make sure that I am understanding what you are saying, because options are not a new structure in the industry? So could you give us some hint as to what aspect of the deals and arrangements you are looking into is particularly interesting or special and when you said dramatic changes likely in 2019, was that referring to dramatic changes in, let’s say, land spend as a percentage of revenues or something else?
Rick Beckwitt: Stephen, I don’t want to going into a lot of detail, because there is a lot of conversations going on right now and with some developers, capital sources internally within our organization, but our stated objective is to do two things, number one is increase our returns and number two, become more efficient in how we utilize our cash. With that in mind, the natural end result would be to increase in some sort of programmatic structure, our just-in-time ability to close on land. So, those are the touch points that, Stuart, Jon and I are focused on and we are all over it to figure out and create something that gets us those objectives.
Jon Jaffe: And the one piece that Rick left out was increase cash flow.
Rick Beckwitt: Correct.
Stephen Kim: Alright, excellent. I am going to leave others to sort of follow-up on the cash flow point, because I am sure they will. I wanted to jump if I could to Stuart, your commentary about technology and Open Door as I imagine you probably expect I would, I was very intrigued to hear what you had to say about that, because obviously I share your enthusiasm about what can happen there. But I was wondering if you could talk specifically about your investments across these technology initiatives, you said, they weren’t just investments but rather a strategy. The last I recall when we visited you down in Miami, you talk a lot about how your vision for harnessing these innovations was to try to improve the new home industry’s premium that it garners over existing homes, which I thought was very interesting. I was curious if you could talk about whether that vision also includes the ability for Lennar specifically to benefit from a competitive advantage in any material way from the things that you have invested in thus far?
Stuart Miller: Well, that’s a lot of questions. And first of all, Steve, I want to say thank you for hearing and listening to what we are talking about in technology, because it’s not easy for everybody to get their head around it and there are some of the elements of our initiatives that are more about our customer interface, others that are more oriented towards the product offering that we have, many have heard and asked about the Amazon relationship and home automation that we have included in and perhaps most importantly, our Wi-Fi certification that we include. So, our technology initiatives are very, very focused on identifying technologies that can alter our landscape. Altering our landscape can mean reducing our own internal SG&A or cost of building homes, some of those are going to be like Open Door. The Open Door technology has enabled us to bring our cost of customer acquisition down and has furthered our initiatives in those arenas. We are working on technologies in and around building construction. Those technologies will help in terms of construction technique and enable a more efficient delivery system and production system and reduce cycle time. We are also working with technologies around the inclusions in our home. Wi-Fi certification is really all about Wi-Fi distribution through the home from wall-to-wall floor-to-ceiling, no dead spots, no speed loss. That’s a big differentiator between the existing home and the new home. The new homes advantage is that we can be enabled for seamless Wi-Fi distribution. We know we can bring the internet to the home, but distributing it through the home is where everybody is running around with their phone looking for that hotspot that works best and we can heat map and engineer our homes to have seamless Wi-Fi distribution that it enables future technologies in an agnostic way. Right now, we are working with Amazon, but we want to be enabled for all platforms. At the end of the day, we believe that our technology initiatives which are not as you know about shiny objects and a lot of hype, they are about execution and building a better mousetrap, they will enable us to drive our costs down both at the SG&A level and at the production level and improve our product offerings to our customer, which will differentiate the new home market from the existing market and I think with our aptitude and drive towards technologies and their inclusions will separate Lennar from other homebuilders. We are very enthusiastic about this and I think the single most important differentiating component of Lennar versus other builders is our ability to disseminate. We have built lines of communication out to our divisions to disseminate new initiatives out to the field and get them adapted and adopted in orderly fashion so that we can reap the benefits of those new technologies and improve our margins, our customer interface, and our product offering.
Stephen Kim: That’s great. Appreciate it. Do you actually have specific targets or goals, let’s say, for next year with respect to any of these initiatives?
Stuart Miller: So, Steve, hype would tell us to put out a number that’s exciting and market moving. The reality is that change happens in basis points and 10 basis point increments quarter by quarter and a piece at a time. We have internal targets, but to try to articulate them for the outside world. The road is bumpy and we are respectful. It’s all about execution. And I think directionally you will see improvement in terms of goal setting, I don’t think we want to get out over our skis.
Stephen Kim: Okay, thanks very much. Thanks.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is open.
John Lovallo: Hey, guys. Thank you for fitting me in here. You are clearly executing at a really high level and that’s certainly encouraging, but the market is much more concerned at this point, interest rates affordability in the cycle. So what I just want to be really clear on, are you seeing anything, anything at all that would suggest that higher rates, higher home prices are negatively impacting demand and are you seeing any evidence that the best days of this cycle are behind us at this point?
Rick Beckwitt: So, let me start, it’s Rick. We are still seeing good solid traffic in our communities. We are still seeing ability by our customers to qualify for homes across all price points. We have not seen a movement to a variable rate product on the mortgage side, which is generally the first sign that there is affordability issues, so while there is a lot of focus in the press on rates going up, we got to keep in mind, as Stuart said in his opening comments, that wage growth is real and it’s happening out there. Confidence is solid. So we put all those things together and look at the headlines we operate our business and the business is strong.
John Lovallo: Okay, that’s exactly what I wanted to hear. And then as a follow-up there is a huge disconnect at least in our opinion with where your stock is trading and where it should be trading. I mean, if you would share that view or if you do share that view, I mean and I understand that you want to de-lever I understand your focus on that, but why not just put a big authorization out and just buy the heck out of the stock?
Rick Beckwitt: Look, I think that we are very stay straight with the Street on what our strategy is, we are not trying to send signals or anything else. We made a significant acquisition, strategic combination with CalAtlantic and our first order of business was integration and operations, our second order of business was cash flow and rightsizing our balance sheet. In sequence, we will we will continue to generate cash flow, I have highlighted that we are focused on orderly cash flow from operations, enhancing that cash flow cash flow by reverting to our core business, enhancing that cash flow through land strategy. And as we have excess, then we will articulate what the strategies are for the deployment of capital at that time. So we just want to be straight, we don’t want to send out signals and stuff like that. Our focus right now was on rightsizing the balance sheet and operating this business and I think we are at the top of our game.
John Lovallo: Very helpful. Thank you guys.
Rick Beckwitt: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Rick Beckwitt: Good morning, Mike. Are you there?
Operator: Again, Michael Rehaut, your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Yes, I am here. Can you hear me?
Rick Beckwitt: There we go.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. I wasn’t on mute, don’t know what happened there. Anyway, what I was about to say was good afternoon now and congrats on the results. First, just looking at demand from another perspective and appreciate all your comments on that already. I just wanted to confirm, I believe Diane reaffirmed the order growth or order numbers for 3Q and 4Q. As part of that original guidance you had given pro forma kind of organic, I guess pro forma for CalAtlantic I believe 2Q with a 3% number and I don’t have amount of the office don’t have 3Q and 4Q, but just wanted to know what the pro forma was for 2Q and if it’s part of the reiteration for 3Q and 4Q those pro forma numbers are still the same as well?
Diane Bessette: Mike, I am just trying to understand the number. So, are you asking those pro forma for Q3 and Q4 are still the same right and they are still compared to the reaffirmation that that I made a few minutes ago.
Rick Beckwitt: I think the way to think about it is that the beat in Q2 is additive to the year.
Diane Bessette: It’s not taking away from the third and fourth quarter.
Michael Rehaut: Right. I think you had given a 3% pro forma guidance number for 2Q and I just wanted to know if that is what indeed you reported if there was upside to that, because the full number of 62% growth was above our 55% estimate?
Rick Beckwitt: So maybe I will answer that. We were about depending on how you look at 8% to 10% above the prior year pro forma number and the balance of the year based on the pro forma that we gave you in the schedule that we released when we did our last call. Q3 was projected to be up about 12% and Q4 was projected to be up about 7%. And as Stuart said notwithstanding the fact that we sold and delivered more homes in Q2, because we guided to a 3% number, we are maintaining our Q3 and Q4 guidance.
Michael Rehaut: Okay, that’s helpful, Rick. I think also just on clarification on demand before I get to my second question. I think you had alluded to from an affordability standpoint that you haven’t seen any difference between price points. I was just curious affordability aside just from a basic demand trend and observational standpoint, if you are noticing any areas of relative strength or weakness by demographic or price point segment or geography?
Jon Jaffe: It’s Jon. As I said earlier, we are really seeing because of the economic conditions strength across the platforms, where you have entry level product and pricing, there is this very strong demand where you have a move-up product in 8 locations, there is very strong demand. I think maybe give you a couple of data points to sort of besides what we are seeing that underlies the demand and our view forward that, that demand is still strong is that we see most of our lead generation start on the internet and lennar.com. And in the second quarter, the traffic on lennar.com was up 50% year-over-year to $4.5 million and that turned into leads, which means people ask me for specific information about communities that was up 43% year-over-year to over 170,000 leads for the quarter. So, there is really good clarity that there is strength and demand across the entire platform. And of course you have higher velocity at a lower price point than a move-up product, but in the markets where we have the move-up products we are still seeing exceptional demand.
Michael Rehaut: That’s great, Jon. Thank you for that. I guess just second question going back to your comments, Rick, regarding land how you are going to be purchasing land going forward in the different types of conversations you are having with land developers, which is of course very important and great to hear particularly again leveraging your size and increased strength in the marketplace. I was curious if any of those conversations or your strategic approach to this more broadly is inclusive of your current-owned lot position given that, I believe, Diane had reported at quarter end that you are about I guess roughly 75% owned, almost 200,000 lots of your 261 owned, if there is any kind of thought towards moving some of that own position to any of your land developer partners in a greater effort to become more capital efficient?
Rick Beckwitt: What I would like to do is I’d like to put a thought on this and come back to it at another time. What we are doing as a company right now is really evaluating what as I said earlier how we can increase returns and maximize cash flow. And so there is a lot of conversations going on that will evolve over the next year. And I would like to really address that when and if that happens.
Michael Rehaut: Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.
Rick Beckwitt: Thank you. Okay, last question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thanks. It’s Buck. Quick question just on pricing power during the quarter, just wondering if you could tell us roughly what percentage of communities you were able to raise price in during the quarter and if you held back on that a little bit because of the integration of sales effort at CalAtlantic?
Rick Beckwitt: So, we don’t really track that kind of information, because the pricing and the price increases happen at the local level on the division by division really community by community basis. But what I will say is you look at the Case-Shiller Index that came out this morning, it was up comfortably year-over-year April over April. I think it’s almost 7%. I think that pricing power, pricing pressure continues to exist as supply is really constrained and demand continues to come to market. I think Jon did a good job of highlighting that demand is strong and even advanced demand relative to the traffic that we are getting on our website is a real good indicator if the traffic continues to build against a really constrained supply.
Buck Horne: Okay, that’s helpful. And last one is just on the multifamily division, just wondering any updated thoughts about the longer term prospects of the business in terms if you think you are going to hold it next to the core homebuilding operation, there is obviously a wall of private equity money that’s trying to still get invested in multifamily, has that evolved your thinking about the right time to move multifamily outside the cord?
Stuart Miller: We are just so proud of the multifamily programs that has been put together I think that we highlighted or Diane highlighted, $9.5 billion in production. We have a very attractive platform and a core strategy of reverting to core, whether that happens, we certainly have not engaged process at this point, because we still think there is some maturity to be had, but we are openly thinking about how that will evolve and expect after to mature over the next year or so.
Rick Beckwitt: But the thing that we are very focused on is when you are doing – when you are involved in construction of about 10,000 apartment homes a year. That gives us additional synergies with regard to cost and maturities. So, it’s core to a large degree and we need to just really focus on the evolution of that business.
Buck Horne: That’s perfect. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Congratulations.
Rick Beckwitt: Okay. So, for those who are still with us, I know we went over a little bit in time. We are really pleased with how things are progressing. We look forward to continued success. Just in conclusion, I will say once again, it all comes down to people. We thank the associates of the company, our trade partners, people across our platform, that’s what makes it happen and we look forward to reporting again in third quarter. See you then.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Thank you. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may now begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good, thank you, and good morning. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, our Controller; and of course, Alex Lumpkin, who you just heard from. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer is joining by phone from California, and we have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here as well. As always, I'm going to start with an overview and Bruce will deliver further detail. And as much as this is our first quarterly call as a combined Lennar CalAtlantic platform, we have a lot of ground to cover. So Jon and Rick will give a comprehensive update on our integration process, and David Collins will give further detail on how purchase accounting affects our margins and earnings over the next quarters. When we get to Q&A, we would like to ask that you limit your questions to just one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that a great deal of hard work has been done, a lot of heavy lifting and it all comes down to a great team of professionals coming together and working cooperatively. From people here in this room with me today to the many throughout Lennar's and CalAtlantic's offices, we're thankful for their hard diligent and focused work. Because of them and what they bring to the table every day, I have simply never been more enthusiastic about the current position of our company in the context of the market conditions that [surrounded]. As a management team, we believe that we are poised to continue to grow our business and to leverage scale in each of our markets to drive efficiencies and to implement new technologies. Current market conditions enable us to grow, while management and company focus enable us to drive continued improvement and refinement of our business with critical scale in the best markets in the country. The housing market has been strong and it is continuing to strengthen. There is a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs have been created, the labor participation rate is increasing, and wages are higher. The low unemployment rate and the labor shortage are driving wage growth which on the one hand has added to our construction costs but on the other hand has expanded our customer base. Customers in our welcome home centers confirm that they feel confident as the economic conditions have remain strong, stable and improving. The deficit in the production of new home that has existed since the market crash has created a supply shortage that matches up with both strengthening demand and a millennial population that has begun to form households and have children. Supply short with strong demand is propelling this recovery forward and the math would indicate that it will still take some years to get the equilibrium. Against that backdrop, the recently passed Federal Tax Act continues to add additional momentum to the economic landscape. While many have been concerned about the effects of the new tax law on housing, it is proving to be a net positive to the wallet of our customer base and stimulative to the economy overall and that is good for housing. Additionally, the doubling of the standard deduction helps apartment dwellers accumulate the savings they need for a down payment to purchase a home and therefore stabilize their housing costs. And while there has been political noise and strife in the market around issues like immigration, gun-control and international trade among others, the generally strong and stable economic setting has been an excellent backdrop to successfully integrate and close on our strategic combination with CalAtlantic. Accordingly with strong management focus and execution, we have not missed a beat. Both platforms have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above expectations while we've brought these two enterprises together. As a part of this conference call, we've posted five schedules that give detailed information to help reconcile the combination of the two entities as we now report as one. While Rick and Jon will detail the integration and Bruce will give greater detail for the first quarter results and on projections for 2018, let me give you a couple of highlights. First, the complicated task of purchase accounting has been undertaken and while numbers can change over the next quarters, we have landed on the goodwill value of $3.4 billion that is already been disclosed in our S-4 so there is no change to that total number at this time. And David Collins will give an overview on how purchase accounting will further affect our margins and earnings over the next quarters. Second, remembering that the first 10 weeks of CalAtlantic closing this quarter are not included in our first quarter numbers, we are already starting to see the power of consolidation at the corporate level, leverage from additional volume, and scale and local market. Since closing the transaction, we are very confident that we will exceed our $100 million synergy savings expectations for 2018 and we are on track to achieve the $365 million synergy for 2019 as well. Our gross and net margins are 21.6% and 11.9% respectively exceeding last year even with the impact of purchase accounting. Both SG&A and Corporate G&A are lower than last year as well, and our income from operations continued the pattern of exceeding our expectation driven by solid fundamentals. These trends should carry forward throughout the year. Sales and deliveries have continued to remain consistent and strong. Focus in the field even during the pre-closing timeframe has and will continue to keep sales and closings on track for the year. Over the next two transitional quarters, we will transition branding and our Everything's Included marketing model so sales and closings will be more flattish although this will give way to higher absorptions and deliveries later in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and of course into 2019 and beyond. Next, we are starting to get a better handle on cash flow for the year. Last quarter you might remember that Bruce guided you to a $1 billion cash flow number for 2018, and I suggested that I felt it would be materially higher. In fact it will be but I'll let Bruce give you greater detail. With significant cash flow though, we will continue to improve our balance sheet and bring leverage down as we articulated when we announced this strategic combination. So let me pause here and turn over to Rick and Jon given the importance and significance of this integration. They will give you an update on our progress. I think you'll see that we remain very focused on the details as we execute both on current and expected business accomplishments, as well as the complex task of completing the task of bringing two great companies and traditions together without missing a beat. So Rick?
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks Stuart. In our last conference call, Jon and I detailed our integration plan and highlighted several integration priorities. I would like to update you on each of these areas. However before I start, I want to thank all of our Lennar Associates and trade partners for their hard work, collaboration and attention to detail during this process. From an integration standpoint, we are operating today as one company. To put it simply, we are Lennar and we are well ahead of schedule. From a technology and system standpoint, we are extremely focused on having the entire company operating on one unified operating platform and are committed to completing this prior to the end of our fiscal year. We had completed the system migrations of two divisions and expect to complete six more divisions by the end of April. Full systems conversions is a top priority as it will speed up all aspects of our business and accelerate our ability to reduce G&A to maximize our synergies. From a land acquisition standpoint, our regional presidents, division presidents and land acquisition teams have been extremely active in leveraging both pre-existing and new relationships to enhance our go-forward land pipeline. In the first quarter, our land acquisition spend was approximately $500 million. As expected, given our increased local market scale we have quickly become the go to builder for almost every deal. We are testing the boundaries of this new relationship to explore some very interesting land acquisition programs and transaction structures. Lennar has always been recognized as sophisticated land buyer with strong teams and deep relationships and we're invigorated with our current market position and will update you on our progress in this stage. From a marketing and branding standpoint, our website integration was completed and live on day one. We ended the quarter with 1344 active communities which included 573 CalAtlantic communities. With the exception of a few close out communities, we have changed signage to reflect the Lennar brand everywhere. From a product standpoint, as we did in the WCI integration we've been calling through the home plans from both companies to identify the most efficient and best-selling plans. As you can imagine some plans are more value engineered resulting in lower construction costs in facts their cycle times. In addition, eliminating plans reduces G&A costs and saves our trades, a lot of bidding time which results in lower construction costs as well. Based on our review of the combined universe of plans, we will be reducing our plan count by approximately 1250 plans. Transitioning from the CalAtlantic design center program to a more efficient production builder within Everything's Included operating program has been our top priority. We have taken a very logical approach to this transition. In general for those communities that will close out starts in 2018, we are continuing with the CalAtlantic legacy product. For those communities which start extending into 2019 and all future communities, we are either converting to existing Lennar Everything's Included product or converting the CalAtlantic product to an Everything's Included program. So let me give you some color on the breakdown. We have 573 CalAtlantic communities. Approximately 200 of these communities will close out this year. Of the remaining approximately 150 communities, 150 will be converted to Lennar product. In fact, we've already converted 100 communities and an additional 50 communities will be computed in the next few quarters. Of the remaining 223 communities, we will be converting those to CalAtlantic product to EI. At the end of the first quarter, we had converted and rebid approximately 15% of the CalAtlantic plans and our goal is to have them already rebid and converted by the end of the fiscal year. So what does this really mean? It means we will build homes faster and cheaper. From a cycle time perspective depending on the product, this effort should reduce build times between 15 and 35 days. In addition we see G&A savings through the elimination of the CalAtlantic design centers. John will discuss the cost savings associated with this conversion. Finally I want to touch briefly on our operations reviews. At the end of each quarter we do a deep dive into every division. We review the historical performance, detailed budgets, projections and five-year land plans among other things. These meetings are focused on setting a clear sense of direction and establishing firm goals. Jon and I have almost completed these meetings with 38 of our divisions and we couldn't be more optimistic as to where we stand as a company. With all that said, I'd like to give a shout out to our Indianapolis Division. This is a new market for us run by a CalAtlantic division president overseen by CalAtlantic regional president. Stuart and I spent the day with them last week and the review was impressive. More importantly, while this was a new player to our company, you couldn't tell that the division and the associates hadn't been with us for years. They have fully embraced the Lennar culture and all of our operating programs. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jonathan Jaffe: Thanks Rick. On last quarter's call we communicated that we expect to achieve synergies of $100 million and $365 million in fiscal year 2018, and fiscal year 2019 respectively. As Stuart noted, we are ahead of schedule in 2018 and are on track for our 2019 targets. The $100 million target for 2018 breakdowns of $50 million for corporate expenses and SG&A savings and $50 million for direct construction cost savings. For corporate expenses and SG&A, we have locked in about $60 million of synergies that is made up of the following two categories. Corporate G&A represents about $35 million made up of executive and administrative compensation, along with public company expenses. Operational SG&A savings of about $25 million are from the reduction and associate headcount in the regions and divisional offices. From the closing of the transaction to the end of the first quarter, CalAtlantic's headcount is down by 15%. By the end of the fiscal year it will be down 21% as a result of transitional associates completing their terms. All of our operations will be combined so that by the end of the fiscal year there will be no duplicate offices. We estimate that 2019 annualized run rate for these overhead savings at $75 million. The integration teams are finalizing the work plans targeting the balance of the savings to achieve our target of $100 million in 2019. For direct construction costs, our national supply chain team have identified approximately $65 million of savings for 2018 exceeding our target of $50 million. This breaks out into four primary categories, national manufacturing and supplier contracts, cost increase avoidance, telecom providers and division level construction cost savings. New contracts with our largest manufacturing relationships have resulted in about $20 million of this amount. These contracts have an annualized run rate of about $34 million with contract terms of 2 to 3 years. We have about 15 categories remaining to complete which are comprised of small to medium-sized manufacturers. We expect this will yield about another $5 million in 2018 and $20 million plus in 2019. By working with our valued supplier relationships, we also achieved $10 million in savings through cost avoidance on products were market-wide increases were already put in place. We were also revisited all of our national agreements with cable and ISP providers. They have agreed to modifications of existing agreements, entering into new agreements, adding complementary and infrastructure services, and expanding ongoing agreements. This work is generated savings of over $9 million in 2018 and $12.5 million in 2019. Our Homebuilding divisions are actively engaged in the process of focusing on material and labor savings and have already identified more than $25 million for 2018. This is where the hard work will be done to accomplish the balance of savings needed to achieve our 2019 target. In total, these four categories are already counting for approximately $100 million towards the 2019 target of $265 million. We've developed a very thorough process at the division level to identify potential savings and how to execute on them. We're conducting cost synergy workshops at seven divisions per month. The process is already commenced as we will complete the first seven divisions this month, and will be finished with all divisions by the end of the summer. The workshops identify, validate and collect cost synergies across all labor and material categories, as well as the improved building practices and value engineering processes to achieve them. We also evaluate every opportunity to improve utilization of our national supplier programs to enhance the rebid opportunity. It is a joint effort of our national and regional purchasing teams, construction and value engineering experts and the division management teams. The process is very detailed and organized. It starts with planning sessions four weeks before the workshop begins, all the way through to a fully developed and agreed-upon plan that clearly articulate accountable resources, timing and synergy amounts. Like Rick, I also want to highlight Lennar's quarterly operations reviews. This is a process that's been in place for 20 years. Rick and I along with regional presidents and regional operation controllers bid every quarter with each division management team at their offices. At these meetings we spent a full day reviewing everything from A-to-Z in our operations. As Rick mentioned, we're through the process in our current round of reviews and as these are the first operations reviews where we're conducting them as a combined company, Stuart is also attending many of the meetings. This tried-and-true Lennar practice is the format in which we're able to evaluate the successes and challenges associated with the integration of the two companies. This is also where we gain direct feedback on the various technology initiatives Lennar is undertaking. First-hand we're able to see our programs, our dynamic pricing, home automation, our trader partnership with open-door, and many others are working. Stuart, Rick, myself and the regional presidents are seeing, discussing and evaluating our business where it happens in our Homebuilding divisions. It is the process from which we build a better company. Lastly, I can't say enough about how amazing our associates are. They are tackling the challenges of the integration head-on and maximizing the opportunities of the combination swiftly and methodically. I also want to thank them for their dedication, hard work and focus. They are what makes us, Lennar. I also would like to thank our trade partners, our manufacturers and suppliers, and our local trades they all have proven to be loyal and creative partners in helping both you and Lennar benefit from this merger. I’d like to turn it back over to Stuart.
Stuart Miller: Great, thanks Rick. Thanks Jon. As you can hear from Rick and from John, we are on it. We've broken down the critical elements of integration of driving synergies and have implementing new technologies and we are executing as you would expect from this team. As I've noted before, and we'll demonstrate as we go forward, we expect to bring these two companies together efficiently and effectively and to drive savings and engage innovation in the process. Let me finally note that while we've been integrating and closing the CalAtlantic transaction, we have not taken our eye off the ball over ancillary businesses or our core strategy of reverting to pure-play. To begin, last quarter I addressed the "fourth quarter bottom line miss" that derived from shifting a onetime noncore non-Rialto transaction. The transaction was actually two separate transactions selling non-core assets that produced both cash and more than the fourth quarter shortfall in profit. The first transaction was the sale of approximately 80% of our interest in Treasure Island and that resulted in a onetime $165 million profit. The second transaction was $150 million sale of a portion of our solar business that generated cash in the third and fourth quarters but has not yet still resulted in a bottom line profit or completion of that transaction. Next as we noted in our press release, we have actively engaged Wells Fargo Securities and Deutsche Bank Securities to advise us in seeking strategic alternatives for our blue-chip Rialto investment and asset management platform. In preparation for this engagement, we have repaid all $350 million of Rialto 7% unsecured bond. Additionally Rialto Mortgage Finance RMF, our commercial loan securitization business will be moved out of Rialto and merged into Lennar Financial Services while certain other Rialto assets will be carved out of Rialto and held separately including approximately 275 million of book value of limited partnership interest in Rialto funds, as well as the associated carried interest. With the shifting of these assets and last year's monetization of Rialto's on balance sheet loan portfolios which is now complete, Rialto has become a blue-chip asset light investment and asset manager that earns fees for raising, investing and managing capital focused on real estate related opportunities. We expect to be able to conclude a program for Rialto over the next 12 months and then we will have taken another step towards pure-play. Finally let me know the progress on LMC, Lennar's Multifamily Communities our apartment segment. This ancillary business which has continued to grow is very compatible with our core for-sale business and therefore remains a primary focus for the company as part of the core for now. In the first quarter, we started 1259 apartment homes and four communities with a total development cost of approximately $464 million. While we've continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we've also significantly grown LMV our build to core program which is focused on building a portfolio of high quality income producing apartments. In March 2018, we had the initial close of our second multifamily venture with equity commitments totaling $500 million. As of February 28, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 82 communities totaling almost 26,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of just over $9 billion. These include 29 merchant build communities totaling over 9000 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $3 billion, 39 build to core communities and our first multifamily venture totaling just under 12,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $4 billion, and 14 build to core communities slated for our second multifamily venture totaling approximately 5000 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $2 billion. Lennar Multifamily continues to mature into a best-in-class multifamily rental enterprise. So let me conclude where I started. It really all comes down to people. We have accomplished a great deal but we still have a lot of exciting work ahead of us. It is our people that have and will make the difference. I once again thank the people across our operating platforms for their diligence and their expertise. Because of them all of them I can comfortably say that Lennar is well prepared to continue to execute. So now let me turn over to Bruce and David Collins for more detail.
Bruce Gross: Thanks Stuart, and good morning. At our year-end conference call, we had David Collins our Chief Accounting Officer provide a primer on the purchase accounting process. I'm going to turn the call over to David first to discuss purchase accounting as it affects our quarterly numbers this quarter and going forward, and then I'll return to walk through our results. David?
David Collins: Thanks Bruce, and good morning everyone. There are many moving parts in connection with the purchase accounting for CalAtlantic. When allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of CalAtlantic, we are required to separately fair value portions of CalAtlantic's inventory consisting of homes and backlog, specs and model homes to eliminate some of the built-in gain associated with these assets. As a result, we will only recognize a percentage of our typical full gross margin on parts of our inventory. Accordingly, our first quarter produced and our second and third quarter results will produce some lower than normal gross margins on these inventory homes when they close which will reduce our average gross margin for 2018. Let me walk you through the mechanics. Over a five month period after the closing date of the CalAtlantic transaction, we will only recognize a percentage of the gross margin on the homes we delivered during that time. The underlying theory behind this, is that for homes and backlog completed unsold homes and homes under construction at the acquisition date, there's very little work that needs to be done by us. Thus, we are not able to recognize full margin on these homes. We are using a 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% profit allocation for these inventory homes sequentially for the five months after the acquisition. These percentages are meant to represent how much value we have added to our home post acquisition. Let me give you an example. On inventory homes that we deliver in the first month, we will recognize 10% of the normalized net margin on the homes that closed in that month. Net margin is defined as gross margin that's only sales and marketing expenses. In theory, we've added 10% value to the inventory we acquired that will be delivered in the month after the acquisition. On inventory homes that we delivered in the second month, we will recognize 30% of the net margin on the homes that closed in that month. In theory, we have added 30% value to the inventory we acquired that will be delivered in the second month after the acquisition. For months three, four and five, the profit recognition is 50%, 70% and 90% respectively. Here is a detailed example for our home and backlog delivered one month after the acquisition. Assume the sales price of $400,000 and a projected gross margin of 20% or $80,000. Assume sales and marketing expenses for that home are 6% or $24,000. The projected net margin of this home is $80,000 less $44,000 or $56,000. The wide-up to the inventory and backlog is 90% of this $56,000 or $50,400. The full gross margin of $80,000 less than $50,400 wide-up I just described, is now the reported gross margin of $29,600 or 7.4%. In the first quarter, this adjustment negatively impacted gross margin by 210 basis points bringing down our gross margin from 21.6% to 19.5%. We project the impact of this adjustment to gross margin to be approximately 750 to 800 basis points in the second quarter and 100 to 150 basis points in the third quarter. As we get to the fourth quarter, we expect to return to normalized results with only a minor impact. Now back to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks David. Since this quarter has many moving pieces, we thought it would be helpful to include five supplemental schedules in addition to our press release. These were all filed with our 8-K this morning. Hopefully, you will find these schedules provide clarity and understanding a complex quarter. Let me start with Schedule 1. This is titled Q1 Homebuilding Metrics, as Reported and Pro Forma. The goal of this schedule is to build up our homebuilding metrics so you can see Lennar Standalone results and CalAtlantic results since the acquisition date to get to today's reported results in our press release. Lennar Standalone new orders were 7387, a 14% increase over the prior year. CalAtlantic new orders for the two week period were 1069, totaling across to 8456 a 30% increase in our as reported results. Lennar Standalone deliveries were 5946, a 9% increase over the prior-year. CalAtlantic deliveries were 819 for the two weeks period totaling across to 6765, a 24% increase in as reported results. Backlog builds up in a similar fashion to a 95% increase in as reported results. The bottom section of Schedule 1 includes CalAtlantic standalone in the middle box. These numbers are pro forma from December 1 to February 28 which includes the period prior to our acquisition date. Note that new orders were impacted by a reduction of 262 due to net accounting reclassifications of backlog acquisitions and contingent sales. Excluding these adjustments, new orders would have increased by 9% for the quarter. Turning to Schedule 2, the scheduled is titled Q1 2018 Earnings Components. The goal of this schedule is to show the buildup of reported numbers starting with Lennar Standalone results versus the prior year and our previous guidance. We've then added CalAtlantic actuals for the period February 13 to February 28 to total across to the combined numbers in today's press release. I'm going to walk through Lennar Standalone results first and then comment on CalAtlantic separately. Lennar Standalone deliveries were 5946 which is a 9% increase compared to the prior year and was within our first quarter backlog conversion guidance of 65% to 70%. Average sales prices increased 5%, home sale revenue increased 15% over the prior year, and gross margins were up 40 basis points over the prior-year as Lennar's sales incentives declined 60 basis points year-over-year to 5.3% of home sales revenue. Direct construction costs were up 6% with labor up 7% and materials up 5%. SG&A improved 30 basis points and again this was due to improved operating leverage and continued benefits from our technology initiatives. As a result of improved gross margin and SG&A results, Lennar operating margins exceeded prior-year by 70 basis points and outperformed our previous guidance of being consistent with the prior year's operating margin. In the category of land, EPU and other came in at $155.6 million which exceeded the $80 million projection. This was driven by the strategic sale of 80% of our Treasure Island interest that Stuart mentioned resulting in a $162 million profit net of $3 million of related costs. As expected, financial services results declined year-over-year as a result of a significant reduction in refi leading to a more competitive pricing environment. Refi's are now less than 10% of our total originations which were flattish at $1.8 billion compared to the prior year. Mortgage pretax earnings were flat at $13.4 million, capture rate was 80% of Lennar homebuyers, and title pretax was also down from $6.8 million to $4.6 million this year due to refi reductions as well. The financial services team is also been keenly focused on the CalAtlantic integration and is making significant progress. We've already transitioned our team with organization, licensing and systems to operate as one team. We have begun originating loans and issuing title policies for our CalAtlantic customers, and this month we went live with the new digital mortgage platform for the combined company using mortgage application technology from [Lint]. This technology provides a simple friendly and frictionless mortgage process leading to a better customer experience. And I'd also like to thank the financial services team for all their hard works with this integration process. Rialto and Multifamily results were on track with [Technical Difficulty] already additional color. So I'm not going to add anything additional to those two segments. Corporate G&A as a percentage of total revenue improved 10 basis points year-over-year as Jon was highlighting the additional operating leverage that we're already capturing. Many of you will be focused on next line which is a subtotal of Lennar's Standalone pretax income before CalAtlantic acquisition and integration costs, purchase accounting, and prior-year litigation reserves. This result was $377.4 million in the current year versus $198 million in the prior-year. The relevant earnings per share before the deferred tax asset charge was $1.21 versus $0.55 in the prior-year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% excluding the anticipated onetime non-cash charge of $68.6 million relating to the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets due to the new lower federal tax rates effective in this quarter. This was below our previous guidance of 25% due to the extension of energy efficient home credits to be applied retroactively to homes closed in 2017. I'm now going to address the CalAtlantic column on Schedule 2. Let me start by saying that these results represent a two week period which included over 75% of the monthly closings but only half the monthly expenses. As a result, the CalAtlantic gross margin was higher than a normalized level and SG&A percentage was lower than normalized level as well. Gross margin excluding the backlog write-up was 22.2%, and SG&A was 8.2%. Financial services started to contribute adding $1.8 million of profits for the two week period and Corporate G&A was nominal as I highlighted were recognizing synergies from the combined corporate operations. At the bottom of this column, we have aligned for total acquisition costs related to the CalAtlantic transaction incurred by either Lennar or CalAtlantic. Additionally, we show the impact David mentioned from the backlog write-up and purchase accounting of 55 million bringing the gross margin down to 7.5% for the month. The Lennar Standalone section and CalAtlantic sections then total cross to tie into the reported results in our press release of net earnings of $136.2 million and EPS of $0.53 per diluted share. The share count increase due to shares issued in the acquisition and outstanding for the two week period. I'm now going to discuss Schedule 3 which is titled Homebuilding Metrics, Historical Pro Forma and Projected. We thought this schedule would be helpful to provide historical pro forma, new orders deliveries and backlog to conform to Lennar's reporting periods. Additionally, we provided our projections for new orders, deliveries and backlog for each quarter for the remainder of 2018 to help you with your modeling. As you can see in the far right column on Schedule 3, we are projecting total deliveries for 2018 to be 45,765. We're providing this additional guidance for 2018 to add clarity and a difficult year to model and then we expect to continue with our historical guidance approach in the future. Additionally, I would like to provide some more key goals for the company in 2018. With the addition of CalAtlantic, average sales prices for the company are expected to be 400,000 to 405,000 for the full year. Gross margins for the full year of 2018 excluding backlog and with write-ups to be in between 21.5% and 22%. The second and third quarter are both expected to be between approximately 21% and 21.6% and the fourth quarter is expected to be in a range of 22.25% to 22.75% given the higher volumes and the synergies that were on track list on the CalAtlantic acquisition. We expect full year SG&A to be between 8.8% and 9%. The second quarter is projected to be between 9.1% and 9.4% and the third quarter is projected to be between 9% and 9.2%. The fourth quarter will see the largest leverage from synergies and higher volumes at between 8% and 8.3%. Operating margins for the full year are projected to be between 12.5% and 13.25% and David provided quarterly backlog and with adjustments which again are expected to be an impact to gross margins of between 750 and 800 basis points in Q2 and 100 to 150 basis points in Q3. Financial services are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million for the year. The second quarter is expected to be $45 million to $48 million. The third quarter $60 million to $64 million and the fourth quarter $65 million to $69 million. Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $60 million and $70 million for the year. The fourth quarter is still expected to have the highest quarter profitability. Q2 is expected to be approximately $10 million to $12 million. With Multifamily, we are projecting $45 million to $50 million for the full year as one apartment sale shifted into 2019. The second quarter is expected to be between $8 million and $10 million, the third quarter will be a slight loss and the fourth quarter approximately $40 million profit. The combined category of joint venture land sales and other income is expected to be about $10 million of profit in Q2 breakeven in Q3 and approximately $15 million in Q4. Corporate G&A is expected to see leverage with the full year at 1.8% of total revenue. We expect integration and deal costs to be approximately $150 million to $175 million for the full year and we will report that item on a separate line. We expect our effective tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 24% for each of the remaining quarters. The weighted average share count for the year should be approximately 310 million shares. However, the second quarter increases to 327 million and the third and fourth quarters 329 million. We expect our community count net to be approximately 1350 by year-end and with these goals in mind we're well positioned to deliver another strong profitable year in 2018. I’m going to touch briefly on Schedule 4 and 5 scheduled for his title Pro forma Homebuilding Statistics to provide you with 2017 pro forma information by segment to help you with your comparisons throughout 2018. Schedule 5 is a Non-GAAP Reconciliation which reconciles our reported net earnings to the numbers provided in the schedules previously.  Finally, our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 42.5% stockholder's equity increased to $13.1 billion and our book value per share grew to $40.10 per share. During the quarter, we increased our credit facility to $2.6 billion and extended the maturity to 2023. We had $734 million of cash at quarter end and although our balance sheet is well positioned with financial flexibility as Stuart highlighted we are very focused on generating significant cash flow with our first priority to retire debt and further reduce leverage. For the remaining quarters of 2018, we expect to generate approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion of cash from operations before ancillary businesses, CalAtlantic related costs and debt paydowns. I would like to conclude by thanking the entire corporate team for all of their hard work in preparing all of the information for this call today. And with that let me turn it over to the operator and open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates. Sir, your line is now open.
Alan Ratner: My first question on the synergies, I was hoping just to get a little bit of clarification here. So obviously you guys are well on track to hit your 2019 numbers and that’s great to see. On the gross margin, I’m just trying to get a feel - when we think about 21.5% to 22% you’re guiding to for this year, is the synergies in 2019 is that a direct flow through to margin thinking about on top of whatever your current normalized margin is or should we think about any offsetting factors there related to either cost creep or maybe as you reposition some of the CalAtlantic product towards Everything's Included. Is there going to be a partial offsets there on the gross margin line?
Richard Beckwitt: On the margin perspective, our guidance really includes the synergies. So as we move through this year, we’ll be gravitating that to about 22% margin on the CalAtlantic product or the home sites coming from the transaction. And that should continue at that level through 2019 and the build out of that entire portfolio.
Alan Ratner: When you say continue at that level, are you referring to remain flat at the 22 or - because you're guiding for more synergies on a percentage basis in 2019 over 2018?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, that’s correct, but as we underwrote the portfolio and went through the accounting at fair value that those were the assumptions that we took into place.
Alan Ratner: And then just on the quarterly breakout on the guidance, it looks like you guys do expect to see a bit of a dip lower on order growth in 2Q and I think you alluded to that just related to some of the repositioning you got going on there. Just want to clarify that's not anything related to what you're seeing quarter to date in terms of market slowdown or anything like that because it seems like you expect that to reaccelerate in the back half of the year.
Stuart Miller: No, absolutely not tied to any slowdown in the market or anything like that. As we transition communities from a design studio approach to Everything's Included as we work through some of the transitions. We just expect that we’re going to see just a mild slowdown to basically even for the second quarter and that’s going to start accelerating as we start picking up absorption rates and implementing our Everything's Included program and getting cycle times moving. So that's just a normal progression.
Operator: And our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: First question I guess just going back to one of the different elements of debate around conversion of the CalAtlantic communities over to Lennar and Everything's Included. And recall that you guys are able to effectively get a better sales pace out of your communities versus the roughly 2 to 3 let's say that the CalAtlantic community sales pace on average has achieved. Thinking about that relative to your guidance, let’s say in the back half of the year where you’re looking at a blended of roughly 10% growth for the back half in terms of order growth. Does that include some of the benefits of the CalAtlantic conversion to Everything's Included and if so, I mean how should we think about that - possibly step function impact in terms of the benefits from a sales pace of shifting those communities over?
Richard Beckwitt: So it’s Rick I’ll take a stab at it and then I'll let the other guys jump in. I think you're just seeing a transitioning program. As I said in my remarks, there is a certain number of communities that were not transitioning to an EI product because their inventory that's just going to normally build out over the year. And with regard to those communities, it's very little that we can do to accelerate the sales pace or construction pace in those communities. For the ones that are getting converted from CalAtlantic legacy product to CalAtlantic or to Lennar CalAtlantic EI product, you'll see a slight pick up this year in absorptions and construction pace. And then clearly those that are getting converted to Lennar EI, we’ll see a faster absorption pace and faster cycle times. As we move into 2019, you’ll start to see a more smooth level of the absorptions that are more consistent with the Lennar absorptions. Although some of the CalAtlantic is higher priced and it won't have that full blend across the entire portfolio.
Stuart Miller: Jon you want to way in?
Jonathan Jaffe: I would add to Rick’s commentary that as you transition from a design center platform to Everything's Included, the timing of sales also varies. So it really very much ties to the discussion we’re having about normal transition. In option program you have to sell much earlier to deal with the timing for the option selections in that whole process. In a very production oriented Everything's Included approach, the timing of the sales happens later in the process. So combined with the factors that Rick and Stuart have mentioned, you take that into account we’ll have to work through that period. So we have a fully baked Everything's Included program up and running and then I think you'll see the impact of that higher absorption across the whole platform.
Michael Rehaut: No, that's helpful and that makes sense. I guess the second question Stuart I noticed in your opening remarks about comments around cash flow and that was - it sounded like a pretty major, I told you so to Bruce with regards to the billion dollars and exceeding that so well within your rights and congrats on that. How to think about - I guess the question is around how to think about cash flow over the next year or two in terms of a longer term goal and with the combined companies and your continued soft pivot with expectations for positive cash flow. I was hoping to provide an update you could provide some updated thoughts around what the next couple of years could look like and how the positive cash flow from a capital allocation standpoint and the different levers that you can use or put that capital towards how you're thinking about that?
Stuart Miller: Well let me say first of all Mike that you're making me blush here. I thought I was a little more subtle than that you might have missed and only Bruce would have picked up, but as long as we're putting it out there. Yes, the focus of this deal and a lot of our underwriting revolved around cash flow and recognizing that we would want to use strong cash flow to think about the balance sheet structure of the company to think about our way forward. To navigate the program of reverting back to pure play and rationalizing how we thought about Rialto, it's great management team being positioned to stand on its own some of the other non-core assets being monetized. Cash flow is a very central part of the story here and one of the really terrific elements of the CalAtlantic deal is the fact that number one, you properly highlighted that a migration from design studio to Everything's Included when you have expertise in Everything's Included platform, you can accelerate absorption rates and reduce cycle times and create affections with your trade partners that enable us to run a better business this enhances cash flow. And so the backbone of this combination was very much about building a stronger cash flow model and of course Bruce properly conservatized that number as we first started talking about it in our last conference call. But as we’ve closed the transaction and we’re gaining confidence, we’re starting to put out the fact that we think that cash flows are going to be strong and they’re going to be stronger in building as we migrate through the years with this combination and this focused platform. Remember it's about market share in strategic markets, markets that we know products that we know, well and Everything's Included platform that we have worked with for years and that we’re getting better and better with. It's about new technologies that can help build a better mousetrap. All of these elements drive bottom-line and drive better cash flows and we think we're going to be able to very quickly take a step up in debt to total cap bring it back down to the levels where we started by paying down debt increasing our equity component and building a really strong balance sheet. Then we think we’ll have excess cash flow to employ, to continue to grow the company, but also to be able to return capital to shareholders. And this also is one of the articulations that we had at the beginning is over the next few years we can certainly envision a way to not only paying down debt to a proper debt to total cap level or comfortable debt to total cap level for us, but also returning some capital to shareholders because cash flows will be very strong.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: It's actually Tray on for Steve. Thanks for all the information you gave earlier that’s going to be really helpful. I want to mention or ask about the Treasure Island sale because it sounds like that was not something that you had initially guided for or expect to happen. What was the thought process around that sale why now, what about divesting that asset or control that asset of your books was attractive at this point in time?
Stuart Miller: Good Tray I’m happy you brought that up I think that as with many of our ancillaries and other components of our business. We don't talk about them much because we’re trying to focus on the core business of the Treasure Island asset sale was one that's been in the works actually for quite a long time. You're right we haven't guided to it these kind of transaction are lumpy and they happen when they happen we can't always predict and kind of guiding to something really sets us up for a miss. Basically the thinking around this was that Treasure Island was not formally a part of our five-point program. It was an asset that we had on our books, it was an asset that going forward would require additional investment it was a non-core program. It's one that we will remain invested in involved in and participatory in but not ones that we want a lot of our capital tied up over the next years and what becomes a nonproductive in current terms – in quarterly terms nonproductive contributor. So this is what we’re doing with many of our assets is looking at - are they current contributors are we generating by bottom line or can we monetize and move forward and deploy capital more effectively. So that's what you're really seeing with Treasure Island we sold 80% of it we recognized a hearty profit - bottom line profit and we have capital to redeploy.
Jonathan Jaffe: And I would relative this is Jon relative to the timing Treasure Island is at the stage in its life cycle where we have our entitlements and we've begun land development. And the first land sales will take place from the partnership in the next couple months with vertical construction starting in the beginning of 2019. So there was a maturation of the asset that really create the lift in value having achieved going through the difficult entitlement process in San Francisco and actually being underway with development.
Unidentified Analyst: And then regarding the new multifamily venture fund that you guys have recently launched what was the thought process around building out a second venture fundamentally. Was it the fact that the first venture was fully invested already or you saw incremental investment opportunities or new potential partners that wanted in on the multifamily type of action that you're going to do with the build to core model?
Bruce Gross: So it’s pretty simple the first multifamily venture was $2.2 billion of committed capital that has been fully committed to assets in the first venture. So there's no more money to spend in that venture. That you know the performance that we achieved in the first venture based on underwriting relative to the original projection is off the chart. So we had investors that wanted to continue into the second venture. We did our initial close of that venture in March we anticipate that that just the initial close and the funds will grow higher than that. And it’s all about stacking these two different build to core opportunities, at the end of the day what we really like to have is $5 billion to $10 billion of completed product that produces an enormous amount of cash flow and gives us the ability to monetize these assets in a much more productive way than selling them off one by one.
Stuart Miller: Just let me add to that and say a number have looked at our apartment community program. They’ve looked at the migration from merchant build where you have a regular monetization of bottom-line as you sell these communities and the migration to a build to core program. And the excitement around that migration for us and for many who have studied it is the stacking of funds where we can build funds that generate fee streams that are regular and recurring. Those funds of new assets best-of-breed assets in the apartment rental business will produce an identifiable and predictable cash flow stream back to the company that will really highlight the strength of that program those been very much of the heart of our program. So it’s been very much at the heart of our program to stack the fund as we fill one up raise capital for the next and keep moving forward, because we're building brand new best-of-class rental product.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Stephen East: So maybe I’ll start with the integration question two things here one Rick you mentioned in your prepared comments maybe some innovative land deal structures et cetera that you’re looking at trying to evaluate given your new economies of scale if you will. And then also on the 100 million and 365 million is there any chance that we would see you not hit those numbers because of reinvesting savings into back into the business I’m not talking about land spin but I'm talking about other things like digital or IT or something along those lines?
Richard Beckwitt: So let me talk about the land piece first and Stephen as always you listen to that carefully. I think as we look at where we stand right now in the land market. As we discussed when we announced the deal and in meeting subsequent to that, our local market presence really puts us in a different position. Given our size and scope the land sellers in the market really have to deal with this, they don't have a choice and as we've been discussing various structures and opportunities to put various programs together. We’re really testing the boundaries of how far we can go with that. Whether it’s just in time takedowns that allows us to keep land off balance sheet till the point in time that we closed the home to third-party or whether it just having fully dedicated land programs with third-party developers. We’re really exploring all of these options and I just say Steve right now just stay tuned we’re very focused on all the opportunities.
Stuart Miller: Let me take the second part of the question Steve and say that you know you asked about taking some of the savings and reinvesting in technologies. I want to go back to the question of cash flow and earning strength. This program has been built for cash flow and driving earnings forward this really enables us to do what we had hoped we would do and we will do. And that is we will be investing in IT, IP and technology that will enhance our business. We will not sit and you see this and you know this we will not sit in a static environment we are constantly reinventing ourselves because technologies can help us become better more efficient and more effective, but I would not think of this as synergies being redeployed or altered into technologies. These will be structured carefully managed investments that are designed to invest in adjacencies that can really help us build a better mousetrap. And you and many others have come down and seen the things that we're working on. I think our future is very bright in this regard.
Jonathan Jaffe: I would add that - this is Jon I would add that we very carefully sort of separate the bucket so that we don't have creep from one benefit to another. So as we look at cost synergies and how that affects our margins and SG&A we put that in isolated bucket and looked at that. As we look at the investment technology that's in our corporate G&A number. We very carefully are aware of that and manage that so that there is I think very little risk of not only conceptually not reinvesting as Stuart mentioned but just as we practically manage it as keeping a clear eye on what we want to achieve in each category.
Stephen East: And a quick follow-on on the Multifamily question, as I calculated it was over 400 [grand a door] for this particular deal which seem pretty high given your ASPs for the company are going to be around that. So maybe a little color on what's going on there. And then just demand broadly Stuart I assume entry level is driving your business but and just interested in what you're seeing broadly on the demand front?
Stuart Miller: The first thing I want to highlight Steve is that we are not unaware of the fact that you've done two compound questions.
Stephen East: I’ll do my best.
Stuart Miller: So Rick go ahead on the Multifamily.
Richard Beckwitt: On the Multifamily side, we’re seeing consistent strong demand in the Multifamily Communities that we have. We’re very focused on the fact that in some markets you're seeing pipeline come to the market now that is sort of depressing rent growth, but not really hurting absorptions. With that in mind, given the program that we have which is a build to core program it's really set up in a way to maximize the value of those assets and capture that value since we’re not ultimately going to immediately sell those assets. These are assets that we’re going to hold for multiple periods of time, they’re an eight year vehicle gives us the luxury of really timing the disposition of those assets to the market, but we are seeing solid demand in most of the communities across the country.
Stephen East: And then on the single family.
Richard Beckwitt: On the single family side, we’re seeing solid demand at all price points across the country. Entry level market is very strong. First time move up is solid and even at the higher price points that we’re seeing good demand. Jon you got any additional color.
Jonathan Jaffe: If you just look at the data our monthly absorption pace was 3.1 sales per community per month in first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.0 in 2017. As you know Steve, just a limited supply and strong demand healthy economy seeing that across the board.
Operator: And our next question comes from Susan McClary of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Susan McClary: In your comments you noted that your sort of thinking about ways to approach the land market especially as you've closed this deal and become sort of go to builder for a lot other things that are going on the ground. Thinking about that longer-term, can you talk to maybe how you're thinking about different ways you could structure this and when we think about some of the things you've done in the past, is there anything about the market today or you’re positioning today that could make some of those strategies perhaps work now or work differently than they have before?
Stuart Miller: Look we think of ourselves as best-of-breed in terms of the breadth of experience that we've had in land acquisition both in terms of just purchasing and as well in restructuring deals. With critical mass in markets we get to look at every deal, we get to work with every land seller. And the opportunity to bring certainty to land sales because we have size and volume and scope in the market really enables us to structure deals that enable a seller to have better certainty as to the ability to actually close the deal and us a better opportunity to structure the kind of deal that we want at a moment in time. So it's our belief that as we pull together the two companies, we have the critical mass in the markets that are most desirable across the country that will have the best negotiating position relative to land owners and developers in those markets and we’ll be able to develop strategies that work uniquely well for those markets. Different markets are different, California is different from Texas. So it will be different strategies in each of those markets, but we have that expertise and the scale really gives us a unique position.
Richard Beckwitt: I would add that while there is - Stuart said it's different in different markets it truly is but every market has land developers, land players that have long-term standing in the market long-term positions. And so now with our scale, we’re able to sit down and structure agreements that really create a win-win situation to control a pipeline of land that benefit both the land seller and Lennar given our concentration in the market. So it’s the same expertise we had. We just have more volume, more visibility going forward to structure deals.
Susan McClary: And then you've noted that you saw pretty strong demand from the entry level all the way through sort of the higher end price points. But there is definitely been a lot of talk as rates have risen the ability to qualify these buyers. Can you talk to any pressures that you’ve seen there or what you're perhaps hearing on the ground across the markets in terms of getting people into these homes and qualify it?
Stuart Miller: Yes, so look interest rates tends to be kind of a flashpoint for homebuilding, but it's never properly contextualize. Interest rates go up within the context of an environment and the environment right now is one of low unemployment and generally wage growth and what is not talked about enough is participation rate, labor participation rate improvement. What we’re seeing in the field is that more of our customers are coming in with confidence they're coming in with certainty about higher wages they've either had higher wages or believe that there will be. And additionally more two earners within the same family because somebody's going back to work, somebody is finding a job that they weren’t able to get before. Those trends tend to really offset the impact of a higher interest rate. Now that raises the question of what amount of acceleration at interest rate increases starts to get to a nosebleed section and again it's all a question of what's happening at the same time. How far are wages going up and how much additional participation is there in the labor force and I think we’re just going to have to wait and see, but as things sit right now I think we’re sitting in a very healthy environment. And then at the other side of that with demand strong, supply remains fairly constrained because of the production deficit that we witnessed in every single year since the crash.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko of SIG. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually Shaw, I’m on for Jack. So my first question was on gross margins and affordability going forward. So looks like your core margins were up 40 basis points year-over-year driven by lower incentive and pricing power, but as you look at the rest of the year could you maybe talk about the balancing act between cost increases affordability and what that means for margins going forward. Because according to our check seems like you guys or the builders have generally been able to pass these increases on so far, but we’ve also heard some affordability concerns in some of the first entry level type buyer. So could you just maybe address those issues?
Stuart Miller: Jon, why don’t you take that?
Jonathan Jaffe: We’re clearly seeing as you heard from our commentary is there is strong demand and as you noted we are able to have pricing power in our markets. As we operate our business we don't price to our cost we price to the market and every market does function slightly differently. But we’re clearly seeing even at the entry level very robust demand. We have our strongest absorptions there and we are able to increase prices there. And on a percentage basis a price increase at the entry level is not that significant in terms of normal dollars. And so I think that we’ve got runway in front of us to continue to be able to do that. To the extent that affordability really does start to change that absorption which again we have not seen yet, not seen any indication of yet, we can look at different programs relative to mortgages to help our customers out, we can look at helping them more with contribution to their closing costs. So we still have bullets left to use when we start seeing a change, but we don't see anything yet on the horizon other than the kind of questions that you’re asking about what happens if and when. But as of right now, it’s very steady, very strong demand and a very limited supply environment.
Unidentified Analyst: And the second follow-up was on financial services going forward. So one of the things that maybe hasn’t been brought up as much as your ability to now leverage the financial service segment further given that you’ll be putting a lot more volume through with CalAtlantic and WCI deliveries going forward. So I mean what kind of leverage can you get from that platform and is there a normalized operating margin number that we should be thinking about today?
Bruce Gross: So as you think about financial services there's a couple points that might be helpful as you think about the leverage going forward. The first one on the mortgage side is we have about an 80% capture rate on the Lennar financial services side. We have an opportunity to bring up the capture rate, CalAtlantic was running in the 50s. They do have more jumbo product and higher price points. So somewhere between that 50% let’s say we get up between 60% and 70% over the next year that's going to add a lot of leverage to the program. With the back office and the secondary, there's a lot of opportunity for leverage with financial services as well on mortgage side. And on the title side, we have an underwriter and CalAtlantic did not, so we're immediately starting the underwriter on CalAtlantic transactions that will add additional opportunities as well. And we've combined the title folks as well they’ll be overhead leverage there as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Is there an operating margin number or like accretion number you're comfortable with today?
Bruce Gross: There is a lot of moving pieces between the two businesses, so I could walk you through those offline if that will be helpful.
Stuart Miller: Okay, so let's end it there. I want to say thank you for those who are attending. Also we have a number of people here in the room, but I want to give a quick shout out to Jeff McCall who is sitting here. Welcome aboard. It's good to have Jeff as a Senior Vice President of the company and you'll hear more from him in the future. But we really do have a top-notch management team that’s guiding the way forward and a terrific group of people through the ranks that are making sure that we're performing as expected. We look forward to telling you more as we go forward and through the year. Thank you for joining.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-01-10 11:00:00) =====

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Very good, and thank you, Alex. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, our Controller; and, of course, Alex Lumpkin, from our legal staff who you just heard from. We also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here. As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview, and then Bruce will give further detail. [Operator Instructions]. Today, I'm also going to ask Rick and Jon to give a brief update on our integration of the CalAtlantic strategic combination. So let me go ahead and begin by addressing the elephant in the room by highlighting our fourth quarter bottom line miss that derived from the shifting of a onetime noncore non-Rialto transaction. While this transaction is still covered by confidentiality agreement that restricts our ability to disclose its actual substance, we can say that it will produce more than the fourth quarter shortfall in the first quarter, and that profitability will benefit from the lower federal tax rate. Bottom line, this shift benefits the company overall. Aside from the shifted transaction, we are very pleased to announce a very productive fourth quarter. We produced very healthy operating earnings, continued to track ahead of the target -- of target on our closed and fully integrated WCI transaction, announced our strategic combination with CalAtlantic, we began the preclosing integration process for that industry-transforming transaction, we continued to grow our LMC Multifamily business, and we continued to position Rialto for a future on its own. Generally speaking, let me say it's a very exciting time to be in the homebuilding industry, and it's particularly exciting to be working here at Lennar. At Lennar, we're focused on every aspect of our business as we continue to migrate the company to a pure-play homebuilding platform. And we continue to innovate and evolve our core operations to perform at the highest levels in the industry. Through the end of the fourth quarter, we were able to continue to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet. We ended the year with a net debt to total cap of 34.4%, even after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. At the same time, the housing market has been strong, and it's getting stronger. There continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs have been created across the country, and wages have generally been moving higher. The low unemployment rate and the labor shortage has been translating into wage growth, and the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators, and that is that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. Accordingly, we've seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be at least in line with or above our expectations. Against that backdrop, the recently passed federal tax act has added additional momentum to the economic landscape. While many has been concerned about the effects of the new tax law on housing with its mixed bag of impacts, initial readings and reviews are suggesting that it is generally stimulative to the economy, and that is good for housing. Concerns about the reduction of mortgage -- of the mortgage interest deduction, deductibility of real estate taxes and state and local taxes seem to be offset by overall optimistic momentum around economic stability and growth. We have carefully studied the specific impacts of the tax law on our typical buyer profile in each of our markets, and we found that the effect is generally positive at their income levels. Additionally, the doubling of the standard deduction should help a new group of frustrated apartment dwellers accumulate savings for a down payment to purchase a home and create personal stability. We continue to feel that the strong economy, together with limited supply and production deficits from past years, have been and will continue to drive demand and pricing power as we move through the upcoming selling season, even though that will be somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases. This really sets the stage for a very successful strategic combination of two of the largest homebuilders in the industry. As you've heard from us before, we are very enthusiastic about our combination with CalAtlantic. This transaction is all about creating leadership and scale in the markets that we know best and with the product lines that have defined our companies for decades. With scale, we believe we can drive both synergies and efficiencies as we build best-of-class operating platforms in the most strategic markets in the country. We believe we can use technologies to innovate and improve our operations to drive cost down. And we believe that we have the best and most experienced operating team in the industry to integrate these two companies quickly, efficiently and seamlessly to drive these efficiencies quickly. Already, you are seeing that the two companies have not skipped a beat since the announcement of the transaction. CalAtlantic announced sales, closings and backlogs for the fourth quarter this morning and exceeded expectations across the board. Likewise, Lennar's sales were up 12% over last year's, deliveries up 5% and backlog up 17%, all above guidance. Both teams of professionals have continued to execute and remain focused on the business at hand while preparing for the closing -- the upcoming closing, on February 12. In a break from convention on these conference calls, I'd like to spend some extended time on the CalAtlantic combination. Given the importance and significance of this combination and its integration, I have invited Rick Beckwitt and Jon Jaffe to provide transparency and give you an update on the progress of the integration planning and timing. I think you will see that we are focused on the details needed to move quickly and efficiently as we execute both on current and expected business accomplishments as well as the complex task of bringing two great companies and traditions together without missing a beat. Rick, could you start off?
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. Let me start by reminding everyone that on October 30, we announced our strategic combination with CalAtlantic for $9.3 billion, which included $3.6 billion of net debt assumed. The consideration included 80% stock and 20% cash. After we announced the transaction, we issued $1.2 billion of senior notes to pay for the cash portion of the acquisition. As Stuart mentioned, we anticipate closing the merger on February 12, 2018. Our strategic combination with CalAtlantic will create the nation's largest builder with latest 12-month revenues in excess of $19 billion. The combined company will have a top three position in 24 of the 30 largest markets in the nation with local market shares ranging from 20% to 40% in many markets. This local critical mass will drive huge savings. During our due diligence period and since the announcement of the deal, we have been focused on integrating the two companies with a plan to drive both top line and bottom line performance. We have a detailed road map to recognize significant synergies through direct cost savings, reduced overhead costs, the elimination of duplicate public company costs, production efficiencies, and technology improvements. I'm happy to say that the CalAtlantic integration is right on schedule. Decisions have been made on regional presidents, division presidents, and all corporate and division personnel. In selecting all personnel, we had a deep bench of high-quality associates from both companies to choose from, and we selected the best player on the field regardless of which company they work for. We've already spoken with all of the senior associates with regard to employment decisions, and we will communicate with the remaining associates in the next two weeks. When the deal closes, we will have five operating regions, up from our current four; and 38 homebuilding divisions, up from our current 33. The new divisions include two new markets, Indianapolis and Salt Lake City, and three new divisions to accommodate the largest scale and footprint of our operations. These new divisions include San Diego, the LA/Ventura market, and Orlando. The operations in the remaining 33 markets from both companies will be combined into one division per market, which will result in significant synergies and operating leverage. However, from a personnel standpoint across our entire footprint, we've retained key purchasing and land acquisition associates from both companies since these associates will drive significant cost savings and drive our go-forward growth in the company. We created an integration process and an execution team that includes leaders from both companies that touch all the relevant parts of our business. Our integration priorities have been technology decisions, land acquisition, product streamlining, EI conversion, value engineering and purchasing. We are well ahead of our time line in each of these critical areas. From a technology standpoint, the go-forward operating system decisions have been selected. System conversions are already being mapped out prior to the closing and will start the day of closing. Our goal is to be operating on one system simultaneous with the build-out of our CalAtlantic tech line. From the land acquisition standpoint, Jon and I and our regional presidents have been reviewing all significant land acquisition opportunities endorsed by the CalAtlantic division since the announcement of the merger. This has allowed us to have a consistent underwriting, leverage our product profile of both companies, capitalize on cross-marketing opportunities and benefit from our increased local market scale when negotiating the purchase of these land assets. From a product standpoint, as we did in the WCI integration, we have been calling through the home plans from both companies to identify the most efficient and best-selling plans. We have analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building CalAtlantic or Lennar products. In most cases, as expected, our Everything's Included Lennar product is both faster and cheaper to build. In some cases, the CalAtlantic Design Center product offering commands a higher sales price with outsized margins. Yesterday, Jon and I completed our review of the development, construction and marketing schedule of all of the CalAtlantic communities. Of the existing 566 CalAtlantic communities, approximately 41% will remain CalAtlantic, 50% will be rebranded to Lennar over the next several quarters, with the remaining 9% rebranded to Village Builder or WCI, which are our Design Center brands. All future communities will be sold under the Lennar, WCI or Village Builder brands. To facilitate this product conversion and rebranding process, Lennar and CalAtlantic entered into a master construction agreement that allows each company prior to the closing of the merger to construct homes designed by the other company on land owned by the other company. Pursuant to this construction agreement, we've already begun to pull permits and start homes in approximately 45 communities across the country. This type of forward thinking has given us a jump-start on product conversion and will accelerate the opportunity for us to benefit from faster cycle times and lower build costs. Purchasing and value engineering is by far the most important driver of this strategic combination. I'd like to turn it over to Jon now to walk through this important element of the deal.
Jonathan Jaffe: Thanks, Rick. We publicly announced that we expect to realize at least $75 million and $250 million in synergies in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. As reported in our S-4 filing, we told our board of directors prior to signing the merger agreement that we believe the synergies will be $100 million and $365 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, respectively. The majority of these synergies, $265 million in 2019, will come from lower direct construction costs. Given that the combined volume represents approximately 125 million square feet of homes per year, this equates to $2.12 per square foot, just a 3.7% savings from Lennar's current direct construction costs. Contributing to this 3.7% savings per foot will be the cost savings associated with Lennar's stand-alone volume as we would expect greater leverage as we increase our production from 75 million to 125 million square feet. We have already put in place a world-class supply chain team made up of associates from Lennar, CalAtlantic and some new additions to the team. We are organized with a 15-member supply chain team, five regional purchasing vice presidents, three regional operating centers and our division purchasing teams. We will benefit from Lennar associates' experience in supply chain and Everything's Included execution and CalAtlantic associates who manages -- managed the supply chain integration of the Standard Pacific-Ryland merger as well as the Centex-Pulte merger. Lennar's three existing operating centers in Florida, Texas and California will be leveraged to officially process the purchasing activity of the larger organization. We have a detailed road map by task and completion date to capture supply chain synergies, which prioritizes action items. We've already evaluated the national contracts between the two companies and created synergy targets by category. Meetings have commenced with strategic manufacturers and suppliers, and we have already started awarding national contracts based on the combined volume. This week, we are at the International Builders Show taking place in Orlando and one-on-one meetings with all of the major vendors. Plans are in place for the exploration of private label manufacturing, vertical integration of components such as concrete block, trusses and panelization, along with product value engineering. Plans for SG&A synergies are in place with our operational structure set, as Rick described earlier. Additionally, when CalAtlantic communities are converted to Lennar's efficient Everything's Included platform, we'll gain more leverage as we will see an average cycle time reduction of 20 days as much as 50 days on the high side. This will increase the sales pace from two sales per month in those converted communities to a pace of 3.5 to 4 sales per month. The synergies of this combination will lower direct construction costs, reduce cycle times, leverage SG&A and increase sales base, all of which will deliver greater profitability and internal rate of return on invested capital. Based on where we are in the integration process and the plans are in place for execution, we're confident in our ability to deliver the cost synergies discussed in our S-4 filing for 2018 and 2019. I'd now like to turn it back over to Stuart for some comments on this.
Stuart Miller: Great. Thanks, Jon. Thanks, Rick. So as you can hear from Rick and Jon, simply put, we are on it. We have broken down the critical elements of this integration, and we are executing exactly as you would expect from this team. As I've noted before, and we will demonstrate, continue to demonstrate as we go forward, we expect to bring these two companies together efficiently and effectively to build the best homebuilding platform in the industry and to drive savings and engaged innovation in the process. So with that, to give greater detail on our financials, let me turn over to Bruce and to David.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $309.6 million or $1.29 per diluted share. The company's core operational metrics exceeded expectations. Excluding the strategic onetime transaction that Stuart highlighted shifted into the first quarter of 2018, we would have exceeded the consensus estimate of $1.47 by $0.04. This compared to fourth quarter 2016 net earnings of $313.5 million or $1.31 per diluted share, which was favorably impacted by energy credits. Revenues from home sales increased 14% in the fourth quarter driven by a 5% increase in wholly owned deliveries and an 8% increase in average selling price to $387,000. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, and we reduced our fourth quarter projections by 950 deliveries. Our operational team managed through this challenging period and were able to deliver approximately 400 of these 950 homes during the fourth quarter as operations return to normal. Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 22.4%, which was better than our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.3%. The gross margins have climbed year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs, partially offset by an increase in average sale price. Sales incentives improved 50 basis points to 5.7% with the improvement driven by our Homebuilding West segment. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our Homebuilding East segment, and direct construction costs were up 7% year-over-year to approximately $57 per square foot driven by approximately an 8% increase in labor and a 6% increase in material costs. Our SG&A percent continues to drive lower as fourth quarter was 8.4%. This was the lowest fourth quarter SG&A percentage in the company's history, and this compared to 8.7% in the prior year. The improvement was primarily due to a decrease in external broker commissions as a percentage of revenue from home sales and improved operating leverage. Our operating margin for the quarter was 14%. The joint venture, land sale and other category was a combined $12.4 million for the quarter compared with our guidance of $90 million to $95 million. This is the shortfall that we highlighted was attributable to the strategic transaction that will shift into the first quarter of 2018. We opened 84 new communities during the quarter and closed 77 communities, to end the quarter with 765 net active communities. New homeowners increased 12%, and the new order dollar value increased 18% for the quarter. Our sales base was 3.2 sales per community per month, which was similar to the prior year. Our dynamic pricing tool has enabled us to carefully manage our inventory again. And as a result, our completed unsold inventory decreased by 127 homes or 13% year-over-year to 848 homes, despite an increase in homebuilding volume. This calculates to only 1.1 per community, which is our lowest level per community since 2012. During the quarter, we purchased 8,200 homesites, totaling $647 million. We continued with our soft pivot strategy. However, this quarter, we did have some larger strategic purchases in the West region, and our homesites owned and controlled now total 179,000 homesites, of which 141,000 are owned and 38,000 are controlled. Turning to Financial Services. This segment had operating earnings of $42.1 million compared to $51.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $27.8 million from $36.6 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations decreased 9% to $2.5 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the prior year, while refinance volume was down 54% versus the prior year. We have shifted to purchase business, which now represents 92% of our originations. The refinance drop has led to a more competitive origination and pricing environment. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% this quarter compared to 81% in the prior year. Our title company's profit decreased slightly to the refinanced transaction to $14.6 million versus $14.9 million in the prior year. The Multifamily segment delivered a $38.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $43.8 million share of gains from the sale of 2 operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 13 completed and operating properties and 35 under construction, 12 of which are in lease up, totaling approximately 14,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.5 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline of approximately $9.1 billion and over 25,000 apartments. Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $2.2 billion compared to $8 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The investment management business contributed $46.4 million of earnings, which includes $14.2 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $32.2 million of management fees and other, which includes $10.9 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate Fund 1 and 2 now totals $119 million. Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $368 million of commercial loans into core securitizations, resulting in earnings of $14.3 million compared with $622 million and $35.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower volume and lower margins, 3.8% in the current year versus 5.8% in the prior year. Our direct investments had a loss of $20.6 million as we continued to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. We have now reduced the remaining REO and loan assets in the FDIC portfolio to approximately $25 million at year end, and all of the remaining assets are under contract to be closing in our first quarter. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $31.6 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $6.3 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $242 million of cash. Our tax rate for the quarter was 34.7%. The rate is higher than the prior year's fourth quarter of 32.5% primarily due to additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. The tax reform bill will reduce our effective tax rate in 2018 from the current 34% to approximately 25%. Excluded from the 2018 effective tax rate is a onetime noncash charge of approximately $70 million to be recorded in our first quarter of 2018 related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of the new lower federal tax rate. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt to total capital of 34.4%, an increase of only 100 basis points year-over-year despite acquiring WCI for $642 million in an all-cash transaction at the start of this year. Our liquidity streams provide exceptional financial flexibility with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our $2 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we are redeemed $400 million of 4.75% senior notes that were due in 2017. And we also issued $300 million of 2.95% senior notes due in 2020 and $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due in 2027, to fund the cash portion in connection with the CalAtlantic merger and to the expenses related to the combination. Stockholders' equity increased to $7.9 billion, and our book value per share grew to $32.81 per share. Before I provide 2018 goals, I wanted to turn the call over to David Collins, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. He will be providing purchase accounting details starting in our first quarter for the combination with CalAtlantic. We felt this is a good time for him to provide you with a primer on the purchase accounting process. So let me turn it to David.
David Collins: Thanks, Bruce. As part of the CalAtlantic acquisition, we will be required to evaluate the assets and liabilities acquired and record them at fair value on the acquisition date, which is expected to be February 12, 2018. These adjustments will include, but not be limited to, adjustments to inventory, investments in unconsolidated entities, other assets, goodwill and debt. Certain of these adjustments will impact our gross margins going forward. There will be a more significant impact to gross margins from the acquisition date through the early part of Q3 2018 as a result of the backlog writeup that is required for homes that have already been sold. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as the final purchase price, which is partially contingent on the value of Lennar's stock on the acquisition date, will impact the amount of goodwill recognized in the transaction. We expect to have our provisional purchase allocation completed by the time we file our first quarter 10-Q in April of this year. The allocation is subject to change within a measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date. We look forward to updating you on our first quarter conference call.
Bruce Gross: Now I would like to provide some goals for Lennar in 2018. Note that we will update these numbers in March at our first quarter conference call to include CalAtlantic. First, deliveries. We are currently expecting to deliver between 32,000 and 32,500 homes for 2018. We expect a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 65% to 70% for the first quarter, 75% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We expect 2018 operating margins to match the 2017 level of 12.9%. The full year gross margin is expected to be approximately 22%; and SG&A, approximately 9%. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin and then improvement as volumes increase throughout the year. However, the quarterly year-over-year operating margins should be fairly consistent with the prior year. Financial Services are expected to be in the range of $160 million to $165 million for the year, and the significant decline in refinanced volume that impacted 2017 will continue to impact the first half of 2018 comparisons. As a result, first quarter and second quarter are expected to result in lower year-over-year earnings. However, we do expect to see year-over-year earnings for the third and fourth quarter to be higher. Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $60 million and $65 million for the year. The second half of the year is expected to have higher profitability than the first half, and our first quarter is expected to be approximately $10 million. Multifamily expects to sell 7 to 9 multifamily communities in 2018. However, these communities are smaller in size than with 2017 transactions. This should result in a range of profits between $50 million and $55 million for the full year. The first quarter is expected to be just over breakeven and then a small profit in the second quarter and a significant portion of the profit in the third and fourth quarter. The category joint ventures, land sales and other income, as we look at this category, we expect approximately $100 million of profit for the year, primarily coming from the strategic transaction that shifted from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of 2018. The quarterly breakout is approximately $80 million in the first quarter with the balance spread over the last 3 quarters. Corporate G&A is expected to be steady as a percentage of total company revenues year-over-year as we continue to invest in technology initiatives. And as I mentioned earlier, our effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 25%, excluding the onetime $70 million noncash deferred tax asset charge. Our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% to 10% from our ending count of 765, with the increase spread throughout the year. With our operating strategies and strong earnings contribution expected, we are well positioned to deliver significant cash flow in 2018. The use of cash in 2018 will be prioritized to first reduce debt. With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong, profitable year in 2018. Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo.
Stephen East: I hope you can hear me okay. I'm also at the Builders' Show. So a ton of information here. So I guess, the first question is when you look at the S-4 as you walk through all the $365 million of savings versus the $250 million, you explained a lot of what was happening, but what was in the $365 million that was not in the $250 million guidance?
Richard Beckwitt: Steve, it's Rick. We were just being conservative as we were announcing the transaction to The Street. We're also very focused on other folks that might have an interest in doing the transaction, and we wanted to put on the table to our shareholders what we knew we could accomplish. And then since the -- we had more detailed analysis, we knew there was upside.
Stephen East: Okay. I got you. All right. And then switching to the gross margin. Costs up 8% in addition to labor being up 6%, surprised me a little bit. I guess, was that primarily the land drive? Or what else was driving that? And how the dynamic pricing play in the quarter, I guess, both from a gross margin perspective and the incentives level that you all reported?
Jonathan Jaffe: Steve, it's Jon. The bulk of that cost increase is really lumber increases that had taken place earlier in the year but were flowing through our cost of sales. So lumber, both labor and materials associated with framing, were up -- made up 32% of that 8% increase year-over-year. Lumber by itself was up 12% from June to September. Since then, lumber has moderated, and we don't expect to see that increase continue, but that's the major driver behind that. And of course, it will flow into margins as well as higher land basis, and particularly in some of our markets like in Inland Empire and Coastal California, so we do have that impact as well. Dynamic pricing, we're definitely seeing evidence that, that is, as we sell earlier in the process, that's driving our incentives down, which is helping attribute to a positive impact on our margins.
Stephen East: Okay. And can you quantify that or do you want to try to quantify that for us?
Richard Beckwitt: So we did highlight that sales incentives have come down 50 basis points year-over-year, and that was driven by the Western region that was a little bit ahead in using the dynamic pricing tool.
Stuart Miller: And you'll continue, Steve, to see incremental improvement as our dynamic pricing tool becomes more and more understood and adopted throughout the company.
Stephen East: Okay. As you all look at it now, Stuart, how much do you think you can capture, say, like in the next year to bring down those incentives?
Stuart Miller: I knew that would be the next question. We're going to sit, wait and watch and see exactly where it goes. It's with all of these initiatives. They are hard to predict. Their timing is even harder to predict. We've got 33 divisions, each implementing, and it's somewhat of a dance. So we're looking at incremental improvement quarter by quarter. And I just think that with each new initiative, we'll see how high it can take us or how low it can take us. And additionally, what new increments we can start to bring to the table with new improvements. So I think there's a lot of room for improvement from all of these initiatives.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG.
Carl Reichardt: Jon, I wanted to ask you about the direct cost reduction that you've called out when you look at the merger. What do you think the savings split would be between labor versus materials versus other elements? Where is the leverage greatest in your mind?
Jonathan Jaffe: Well, from a prioritization standpoint, it's going to be on the materials side. We’re first going to attack national contracts. Labor, because of the labor shortage that exists out there, it's definitely high up on the priority, but it's going to take a little bit longer to get the trades converted over to the greater volume and in which trades have the ability to expand into that. But as you look at the actual math behind it, it's probably split pretty evenly between the two categories.
Carl Reichardt: Okay. And then Rick, you were kind to talk a little bit about the changeover in the near-term communities for CAA. As you look at their longer-term land positions, what kind of flexibility do you have to alter product choice and then perhaps change mix over time? And I'm thinking about them being slightly more of a move-up focused than you, if I've got it right. Is there a chance that you could see more of that product move towards entry level as you bring it to market?
Richard Beckwitt: So in the go-forward deals, certainly, things that are platted or what have you, we have great flexibility in product selection. We got, in the Lennar world, move-up product. We have that in Village Builder brand and in our WCI brand. And there may be some CalAtlantic product that we ultimately convert to EI. So we have got great flexibility to do any at all. We, Jon and I, have spent a lot of time looking at individual deals, figuring out which ones we think we should increase velocity and put some lower priced product in there. So you'll see us do all of the above.
Jonathan Jaffe: And I would just add that, as always, it's going to be a community by community, submarket by submarket analysis of what produces the best returns, both margin and IRR.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman: On the detailed overview, it's extremely impressive, so thanks, Jon and Rick for that. I guess, my first question, maybe, Jon, you can talk about the benefits of scale. I know when you're the largest builder, you said in over 2/3 of your market, so at least top 1 or 3 position. Assuming you get to see every land deal maybe before everyone else, can you walk through other benefits of scale? And then I have a follow-up, please.
Jonathan Jaffe: Sure. And we know this from the markets where we already have these dominant positions. As you said, Ivy, first and foremost is access to the land market where we have a priority position there. Equally important is we have a priority position relative to the labor supply. As you know from past conference calls, we have a very strong focus at Lennar, becoming the builder of choice for the trade partners, and we've already seen tremendous progress just based on Lennar's volume. The additional volume added to that, that takes us to up that 125 million square feet, I think is going to give us tremendous opportunity to truly become the builder of choice for the trades because we'll able to put consistent productivity in front of them, which is critical for their labor force to keep their peace workers focused on the job, building the same plans over and over. That's going to be a huge benefit for us.
Richard Beckwitt: And one last thing, Ivy, it's people. When you have the biggest, best operating machine, especially on the sales side of the equation, people want to come and sell homes in that operation. So we attract great new home consultants in the organization.
Jonathan Jaffe: And I would just add, too, because -- as we've talked a lot about on our calls, our focus relative to marketing, and really, the success we have had with social media and our online presence, that's going to be a tremendous leverage opportunity for this additional scale at almost no additional cost to be able to do the digital marketing effort that will bring in high-quality customers at even lower and lower costs.
Ivy Zelman: Great. That's very helpful. The second question, as you talked -- Jon, you mentioned opportunity for backward integration, concrete block, framing panelization, et cetera, maybe you could just take one of those as an example. I'm sure you've look at the investment and the return and the impact to profitability that you may derive from that type of backward integration. And I know it's a lot but maybe even the timing with the combination, obviously, only being finalized in February. Is this something that you think about in a few years? Or could it be [indiscernible]? So a lot there, but appreciate any response.
Jonathan Jaffe: Ivy, it's a little bit longer on the time horizon just because it's -- we have [indiscernible] carefully. We definitely are deep into the process. But if you look at Florida, as an example, we're going to build 15,000 homes in the State of Florida. There's tremendous opportunity with that scale to have activity in Florida that's vertically integrated. We will determine what those values are, and that will really create the prioritization of what goes first, whether it's concrete block in Florida, whether it's truss plans in Texas. Those are things we definitely will get to, and work is underway. But it's really premature to talk at any more detail right now.
Richard Beckwitt: I think what you'll see, Ivy, is we'll probably do some sort of mutual arrangement with someone to get in. And then as we understand the dynamics and the pricing of the business and flow-through, you'll start to see us do something on a stand-alone basis.
Jonathan Jaffe: And I'd just remind you, Ivy, we have Paul Dodge, heading up this whole effort. He's been on both sides of the equation. He's been on the supplier side as well as the builder side, so we have a good understanding of all aspects of what it'll take to accomplish this.
Stuart Miller: So the focus -- yes, just to finish up, Ivy, the focus has been squarely on driving the greatest savings through our cost structure. We're starting with the lowest-hanging fruit. It's going to be in and around the material side of the business and national contracts. Probably, the next level down is in and around local labor. The consolidation and becoming the largest concentrated local builder is really important in terms of consolidating the attention of the labor force. And this is going to be a big benefit and a strong local focus. So to us, that's kind of the second tier of low-hanging fruit. As we get to a third tier, and Rick, Jon and myself have been looking strategically at how we think about some elements of vertical integration that can change the way that we look at the building industry as we develop this core scale in each local market. Rick highlights in Florida believes that building 15,000 homes, that's scale. That enables us to do and look at a lot of things that we haven't been able to look at before in an economical way, and these will be drivers of savings at a third tier as we go forward. When we talk about these various tiers, I hope you're getting the sense that the integration process and the focus is happening very quickly. The lowest-hanging fruit will be incorporated at the very beginnings of this combination. The second and third level will come quickly behind.
Ivy Zelman: No, that's extremely helpful. Just quick, I'll sneak in one more, Jon, you mentioned digital -- I'm sorry, digital marketing. And can you talk about how many hits a week or how successful you see from that initiative?
Jonathan Jaffe: I think the metric we look at as most impactful is the number of leads we get from that. That's people who actually ask for information. So versus hits, which is hard to tell what that leads to, but leads are people who are interested enough to ask for information. We are continuing to generate over 100,000 leads per quarter from our social marketing outreach program.
Stuart Miller: And let me just say parenthetically, from our viewpoint, the numbers that we're producing are impressive. We view ourselves as being in the very first inning of digital marketing and what we can do with it. So we are very focused on getting better and better at targeting and engagement. And we think that we can create a great digital conveyor belt of customers that are interested in our products. So there's more to come in this arena.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore.
Stephen Kim: Hopefully you can hear me well. I'm also at the Builders' Show. You've laid out some pretty impressive initiatives that you had been taking to try to get ahead of the integration. I guess, I was curious as to whether any of that has spread over into the land side of the equation. And if you could talk a little bit about what you envision for land spend for a larger organization, given some of the overlapping in existing markets that you will have. So just if you could comment on what you expect from the land spend side in terms of expectations, different from maybe Lennar stand alone.
Richard Beckwitt: So Steve, I'm not really prepared to give you a dollar amount yet because we're going through that now. But I can tell you that our entire organization from a division president, regional president, land acquisition teams are totally coordinated on the opportunities to drive growth. What makes deals successful, as Stuart has highlighted in the past, is, number one, integrating the operations and become a one company; number two, going after that low-hanging fruit; and number three, keeping machines going and growing. And when deals pause and stall out is because they're not focused on all of those aspects of the business. So as I highlighted in my commentary, we've gone heavy in purchasing personnel and heavy in land acquisition personnel and development personnel because that's the future of the company. Jon and I are reviewing the significant deals. Our regional presidents and division presidents are isolating those transactions, maximizing absorptions and pace and looking at value enhancement in each one of these deals.
Jonathan Jaffe: Steve, it's Jon. I'd also add that as we look at the process of integration, we have prioritized land acquisition as the absolute top priority from the perspective of analytics, underwriting tools, approval process, so that we can could hit the ground running and not skip a beat in terms of giving our teams, our operational teams on the field, the clarity of how they will go about executing the acquisition game plan.
Stuart Miller: And then let me just add as an overview here, Steve. I don't want you to think of Jon and Rick's primer or overview on integration as a group of initiatives. These are action plans. And the action plans have been constructed. They are being put in place. And I think that not skipping a beat is our primary focus right now. As it relates to land, there are land plans and land expectations being consolidated and put together at each divisional level. And it's as a primary focus as to exactly how many dollars we're going to be spending over the course of each next year in order to maintain the trajectory that's expected. We'll give better ideas of consolidated numbers after we close the transaction. Hopefully, we've been able to convey to you that the we're not waiting to close to come up with a plan. The plan is going to be well in place to be enacted the day we combine. And one last point, and that is, we're benefiting from just tremendous cooperation and professionalism from Scott, Larry and Pete. They are sourcing these opportunities. They're bringing them to our attention. They're out there actively looking to help the pro forma company to grow, and we couldn't thank those guys enough for their leadership throughout this whole process.
Stephen Kim: Great. No, that's very helpful. And it kind of gets -- as sort of as a segue to my next question, which is looking a little bit more at the construction in progress side of the equation. So I guess, first, kind of a two-part question, the conversion to you, Everything's Included, this is something you've done before, actually. And was curious if you could share with us how long do you think it takes as to sort of make a conversion from design studio to Everything's Included? Is there a learning curve, for example, with trades or with your supervisory staff? Are there sourcing contracts that have to expire first, which need to be integrated into Everything's Included? Those sorts of details, if you could just give us a sense for how long the conversion to EI takes. And then sort of a second question kind of embedded is I know there's a lot of concern on the part of industry, do you largely believe that you will be able to integrate CalAtlantic effectively? Just being a little concerned about the timing, the year, the time of year, the spring selling season, where you really need to get all your ducks lined up in a row. You've shared a lot, which gives us some comfort that you're not going to be caught off guard there. But just so if you could put maybe just specifically address anything that you're doing, recognizing that this is a super important time of the year to be going to market and going out with a bit of a unified strategy.
Stuart Miller: Steve, let me start off, and just an overview, Jon's going to kind of fill in some of the blanks. But in combination and integration, you've seen some of this with WCI. This is not an arbitrary race to get something done. This is an orderly strategic process of making sure that we keep the racecar on the track. And we make the changes incrementally as they are most effectively implemented. There is a differential between existing product and product that is to be started. And on existing product, there is a difference between communities that are just finishing up versus those that are just getting started. So the process of actually implementing Everything's Included is something that's going to be a part of an orderly process as it has been in the past. Jon?
Jonathan Jaffe: So it starts with a game plan community by community that we'll look at. Rick was highlighting some of this in his comments to which communities it makes sense to lead as the existing CalAtlantic product and build through and finish them out in their design studio format. And then which communities does it make sense and when to transition over to Everything's Included product. Now to your question about how difficult that is, that Everything's Included project is already existing in the Lennar portfolio, right? It's not something we have to create. We know it, and we know in each market. Now remember, one of the strategic reasons we are really excited about this combination is its markets we know and its products we know. So we know the products. We also know the Everything's Included levels in those markets. We've done that research, and so that will be a consistent, somewhat seamless transition to just put the Lennar product and the EI package on an existing CalAtlantic community. So some will continue out as appropriate to finish out as CalAtlantic product, and then bulk of the transition you'll see in the second and third quarters when we switch over to EI product. It's my expectation that as we turn the corner into 2019, virtually 100% of our starts will be Everything's Included product or under the Village Builder or WCI brands.
Richard Beckwitt: And Steve, one final point. It's -- I think it's important for you to realize that we really only have two markets in this whole operational -- operation combined that have never done EI. That's Salt Lake City and it's Indianapolis. In all of the other markets across the nation, we've got personnel that know how to do this, know how to design it, know how to build it, know how to source it, know how to purchase it. So this is not a new thing.
Jonathan Jaffe: Not only that. It's Jon again, obviously. Those divisions -- all divisions are supported by regional presidents that know this product and market with obvious exception of one CalAtlantic regional president that's coming over. But he and all the other regional presidents will be supported by purchasing teams, national and regional, marketing teams, national and regional, that really know our Everything's Included platform inside and out.
Stuart Miller: And look, as just as a follow-up, Everything's Included is not -- it's not an easy thing to just adapt or adapt to or adopt. We've seen a number of builders try to copy what we do. It's a process. It's a process on the sale side. It's a process on the production side. There are learned behaviors. They will be implemented and learned over time. Everything's Included is an attractive program. It's a marketing and production program. It's attractive because it really has big benefits on the production side. It will take some time. It will take some learning, but we're very confident that the implementation will be orderly.
Stephen Kim: Great. And what about the spring?
Jonathan Jaffe: What do you mean, Stephen, what about the spring?
Stephen Kim: Just is there anything particular that you are doing or are planning to become that reflects just some of the challenges of entering the spring selling season as opposed to, let's say, doing this at a later time in the year? Maybe where the industry isn't quite so much gearing up with generally a much more aggressive posture? I was just curious if there's anything about the spring that affects the way you go and approach the integration.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes. So Steve, I think that really gets to the importance of this master construction agreement that we signed with CalAtlantic. We have 42 communities across the country already permitted and starting homes right now that's Lennar brand. This has never been done in the [indiscernible].
Stuart Miller: Yes. And let me say, as it relates to the spring, Steve, I think that the single most important thing is at each community level that there'd be certainty, okay? The communities are already purchased. The product is pretty much in place. We're not going to cloud the spring selling season with a lot of uncertainty. The mapping of the exactly what each community is going to be doing is already being set out. As we enter the spring selling season, there will be certainty at each community level, and we'll be prepared for the spring, if that's the question.
Jonathan Jaffe: And just one more comment, addresses your question, but I think, really, all of these questions. We are already commencing what we call community operations reviews. So our management teams, the new combined management teams are going around every community, meeting with the sales team in that community, construction team, the customer care team, to understand exactly where that community is, really confirm the road map and make sure everyone is on the same page, everyone is rolling in the same direction.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America.
Peter Galbo: It's actually Pete Galbo, on for John. Bruce, I think you mentioned an 8% increase year-over-year on labor cost, and that was up from the 5% you mentioned in 3Q. I was just wondering if there's anything more in that outside of the disruptions from the hurricanes pushing up labor costs or any other material changes happened in the quarter.
Jonathan Jaffe: It's Jon. I'll take that. So like you said, the bulk of the increase even affecting the labor side is happening in the framing component. There's nothing unusual on that, I would say. Even relative to the hurricanes, there is trade hero there that have increased prices relative to that, I think gets pulled into the repair business. But by and large, it's just the continuing trend of the labor constraint against a improving homebuilding environment.
Peter Galbo: No, I appreciate that. And again, appreciate all the color on the topic of integration. I guess, Stuart, just taking a higher 10,000-foot view here. You now have two builders that are effectively double the size of your next largest competitor. And just wondering how you guys are thinking about -- with everything else that's going on, how you're thinking about how your competitors may respond, the smaller competitors may respond to changing dynamic that you guys have kind of set out here on.
Stuart Miller: I think that the way we're configured, we have our eyes squarely focused on our business. And we're not all that focused on the competitive response. As you come around the halls of Lennar, you will see that we are very independently focused on how we're configuring our company for the future. It's not just this combination and the seamless execution that we expect of ourselves. It's not just preparing for a spring selling season, making sure that there's certainty at the division and at the community level with product in place and ready for the spring selling season. It's also about the number of initiatives that we have on track concurrently, even while we are integrating, focusing on our digital marketing strategy, enhancing beyond 100,000 leads per quarter to something much greater than that. It's about a dynamic pricing tool that is going through implementation at just Lennar divisions and ultimately, combined divisions that will redefine the way that our business operates, driving SG&A lower and profitability higher. We are thinking way outside the competitive landscape box to think about how we can -- I've said it over and over again, how we can build a better mousetrap. And so the competitive response from the rest of the market is of less consequence to us than how we can vertically build a better program that is something that the homebuilding world hasn't yet seen. And we think that the key to the kingdom for us is, in large part, this local concentration and scale, the ability to build that concentration and to rebuild both production lines, sales approaches, marketing approaches and internal operations to build a better program for homebuilding going forward. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it from 10,000 feet.
Jonathan Jaffe: And supporting that, supporting Stuart's comments on what we see in front of us, this is something that's not so obvious to everybody, and that is the people and the culture at Lennar. And what we have is a group of people that are really enthusiastic and excited about these challenges and opportunities in front of us that are welcoming and looking forward to the CalAtlantic associates joining their teams, and there is just overall enthusiasm about what we're taking on and the opportunities.
Stuart Miller: All right. So listen, in conclusion, I just want to thank everyone for joining us. I think that you can see that we've been very focused on integration, focused on our business, and we'll continue to be that way. I do want to say, as a parting comment on this call, that the efforts that we've articulated have been efforts around both companies. And the tireless work of Scott and Larry and Pete, especially Jeff McCall, who we haven't even mentioned yet, and the many, many associates at CalAtlantic that we look forward to getting to know better and work with, it's just been a very impressive and -- partnership to build the business platform as we go forward. We're really enthusiastic about this combination. We're enthusiastic about what it does for us in the short term and where it can take this company in the long term. And as Scott Stowell joins our Board of Directors and as we begin moving forward, we're very enthusiastic about the business, and I think that's come through on this call. So thank you for joining us. We look forward to giving you future updates as we close this combination on February 12, as we continue to integrate and ultimately, as we report quarterly progress going forward. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now all disconnect.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning and thank you. Thank you, David. This morning, I'm here with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, who you just heard from; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto and others as well. As always, I’m going to start with a brief overview. Bruce will deliver further detail. And then we’ll go to our Q&A portion where we ask your indulgence that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour that we’ve allotted. So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce very healthy earnings for our third quarter, in spite of the active hurricane season that’s affected our business at the end of the third quarter and carried into the fourth. And in fact let me begin today with an acknowledgment of the many across our platform who have been affected by adversity. First, in our Texas markets, Hurricane Harvey affected all of our markets and especially of course Houston. And I want to thank the Lennar associates who responded and continued to respond so selflessly to care and assist with their time, with their wallets and with company funds to make a difference in the aftermath. Right now, it seems like this storm took place almost years ago but it was really only just last month and the continuing efforts are very much appreciated. Next, Hurricane Irma came barreling through Florida through Georgia and up the eastern seaboard and affected millions of people in those areas. Again, Lennar associates responded and are still responding with their hearts, their care, their wallets, as is the company and this is greatly appreciated. Additionally with Hurricane Maria, our hearts go out to the people of Puerto Rico and our company through the Lennar foundation is meaningfully contributing there as well. And then of course just yesterday, we all woke up to the tragedy that has gripped Las Vegas, another significant Lennar market. The ripple effect of the Las Vegas shootings affects us all but most impacts those closest to it. And again, Lennar associates are activated and have already organized a blood drive internally and are contributing money to support grief counseling for those in need. Difficult circumstances call on great companies to properly balance excellent business practices with the human element and I am particularly proud to say that I believe that we have done exactly that at Lennar and I’m very proud to be able to represent our efforts. Against that backdrop, let me say that through the end of the third quarter and into the fourth, we’ve been able to execute on our business plan and strategy of growing and refining our business while focusing on our balance sheet after paying all cash for our WCI acquisition at the beginning of the year. Overall, we’ve continued to see strength in the housing market through the third quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins continue to be in line with or above our expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market as jobs are being created across the country and wages are generally moving higher. The often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into wage growth. And while much of the data collected by the government doesn’t seem to reflect significant wage growth, the customers visiting our Welcome Home Centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment and an ability to afford today’s more expensive homes. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the same sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment is generally strong and stable and improving. There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the government’s pro business stance will result at least in job security and possibly some tax release as well. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery is at least continuing to churn slowly while at sometimes even seems to be giving way to a more definitive accelerated recovery and reversion to normal. We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years have been and continue to drive some pricing power as we moved through the selling season and that is somewhat offset by land and construction cost increases. Additionally, the economic realities of a constraint supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have and have had a rational impact on decision making for first-time homebuyers as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market. Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market. And as we look ahead to the final quarter of 2017 and into '18, we are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve. Now against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for-sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017 in spite of the storm activity described before. Deliveries for the third quarter increased 12% and our gross margin and net margins improved 20 basis points and 40 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues was driven by year-over-year community count growth of 9%, while our new order pace remained constant at 3.4 homes per community per month. Our strongest markets were Southeast Florida, the Bay area, Inland Empire and Portland, all with sales pace of over five homes per community per month followed by Orlando, Tampa, California Coastal, Fresno and Seattle, all with over four homes per community per month. We continue to see success with our digital marketing focus, driving better quality traffic to our communities. In our third quarter, our social media outreach generated over 115,000 leads, a 15% year-over-year increase. This allows us to operate at a very efficient level where our total advertising spend is now down to only 40 basis points of our revenue. Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We continued to see the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during the third quarter as we reduced our completed unsold inventory by 9% year-over-year and 21% sequentially without sacrificing margins. Additionally and directly related, we have also seen our incentives per home delivered decrease to 5.5% across the platform which is our lowest sales incentives since 2006. As you’ve heard from us in prior quarters, we are using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model. Fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well, we continue to focus on overall operational efficiency driving our SG&A to historic lows of 9.2% for the third quarter which is the lowest in history. As I’ve said before, we are simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time. As I’m sure you will recall we closed on the WCI transaction in the first quarter of this year. The integration of this acquisition has been executed seamlessly by Lennar’s operating teams in the field and by our corporate support groups as well. With any combination, the hard work begins at closing. After all the fanfare, the real congratulations are due as results are achieved. The WCI combination and integration is now complete and the results are coming in exactly as expected, as Lennar’s margins, SG&A and bottom line are performing as promised. We simply have an excellent management team with tremendous bandwidth to execute and I’d like to take a brief pause to express my appreciation for that hard work and focus as well and for the opportunity to represent their work and accomplishment to our investor community. In addition, as I noted earlier, we came to the end of the third quarter Hurricane Harvey came through in Texas and that was followed by Irma at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For homebuilders and homebuilding divisions on the business side, these storms present many cumbersome challenges, whether the storm is a direct hit or a near miss. Preparation for these storms requires a shutdown of the business operations with extensive preparation to batten down the hatches, so to speak. Associates need to care for their work environments and for their personal residence and families at the same time. After the storm, caring for our associates who might have been affected while surveying damage, attending to our customers and restarting business operations is equally difficult. As we noted in our recent press release, we have come through these two hurricanes quite well. We have attended to our associates. We have accessed the damage to our communities. We have attended to our customers and have restarted business operations. As we have said, our communities sustained only minor damage and due to the business disruption, we expect approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018. Additionally, given the volume push into 2018, the positive trajectory of our margins will be temporarily impacted as well and Bruce will give some additional detail. With that said, the Lennar team has done an excellent job of managing through difficult times as these hurricanes affected geographies representing some 50% of our volume by closings. Considering both the all-cash acquisition of WCI and the affect of the two hurricanes, we are pleased to report that we have continued to focus on cash flow and on our balance sheet. We have maintained our 7% to 10% growth target and have focused on driving our operating costs down in order to drive bottom line and cash flow. These strategies have brought our balance sheet back to the position of the year ago with our debt to total cap at 39.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some of this progress over the next quarter, our strategy continues to be to drive strong cash flow and position our company for opportunity in the future. Now let me briefly turn to our Financial Services segment. As you’ve seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the third quarter as it contributed operating earnings of over $49 million. While profits and projections are down slightly from last year, the decrease is primarily due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Our core Financial Services business is growing in lockstep with our homebuilding operations and is innovating with new products like our recently announced creative student loan program. As the refi business has diminished over the past year, Lennar Financial Services continues to focus on product innovations as well as its non-Lennar retail business to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation, will give additional color in just a few minutes. LMC, Lennar’s Multifamily Communities, our apartment segment has also continued to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter driven by the sale of two of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we’ve also significantly grown LMV, our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the third quarter, we started 836 apartment homes in three communities with the total development cost of $371 million. As of August 31st, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 75 communities, totaling approximately 23,700 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.3 billion. These include 36 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.2 billion and 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion. Our multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations. Turning to Rialto, Rialto contributed $3.2 million to the bottom line this quarter versus $5.9 million a year ago, as our direct investments continued to be a drag on overall performance. These direct investments should be winding down over the next two quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. This will enable us to efficiently lever our existing infrastructure and overhead and focus on our investment management business and RMF business segment. The investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base. As we have said before, our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers, which has helped Rialto attract both existing and new investors to newer vehicles. Our third opportunity fund, which is approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments, has already invested or has under contract 43 transactions involving the investment of over $850 million of that equity. On the Rialto Mortgage Finance, RMF, side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 41st through 43rd securitization transactions during the quarter with net margins averaging 5.1% selling over $236 million of RMF originated loans. Finally, just to mention FivePoint because I always have, as you all know, it’s now an independent public company. Accordingly, the FivePoint management team will speak regularly for its asset base including the very positive news recently on progress at Newhall Ranch. As I’ve said before from Lennar perspective, the new stock symbol FPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet as the value embedded in these extraordinary California assets is unlocked. In conclusion, across our platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our third quarter and we’re feeling very optimistic about our future. Given production deficits that persist, existing housing supply constraints, a pro-growth stance in government, generally solid employment fundamentals, we believe that the macro environment reads very positively for the next years and there is still a long runway in this recovery. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market for the future. In spite of the short-term speed bumps that will temporarily slow progress in the fourth quarter, each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthen. People, assets and operations are all aligned as we begin to prepare for 2018. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were 249.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compared to third quarter 2016 net earnings of 235.8 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.03 per diluted share impact due to a lower 31.1% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the third quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 4% increase in average selling price to 375,000. As Stuart highlighted, our homebuilding team has focused on the dynamic pricing tool to price and deliver more efficiently and it is reflected in our results. Our delivery machine achieved a backlog conversion ratio of 74.5% while our completed unsold inventory dropped by 233 homes or 21% sequentially to the lowest level per community since 2012. Our pricing efficiency is also noted as our sales incentives dropped 40 basis points year-over-year to 5.5% which is an 11-year in a row and drove our gross margin outperformance. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.8% versus 22.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percentage were once again its highest in our Homebuilding East segment. The gross margin percentage was benefitted by 30 basis points this quarter due to insurance recoveries. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $56 per square foot driven by an approximate 5% increase in labor and 3% in material costs. Our SG&A percentage continues to drive lower as Q3 was 9.2% compared to 9.3% in the prior year. Included in our SG&A in the third quarter were transaction-related expenses related to the WCI acquisition which had a 20 basis point impact but were offset by insurance recoveries. Our operating margin improved by 40 basis points for the quarter to 13.6%. Other income net was 2.8 million compared to 30 million in the prior period. In the prior period, other income net included the sale of a clubhouse and management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures.  Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was 9.7 million which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur G&A while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 108 new communities during the quarter and closed 86 to end the quarter with 758 net active communities. New home orders increased 8% and new order dollar value increased 14% for the quarter. And as we disclosed a few weeks ago, there were approximately 120 new home orders that were impacted due to Hurricane Harvey. Our sales pace was 3.4 sales per community per month which was the same as the prior year. During the quarter, we purchased 12,700 home sites totaling 498 million. We continue with our soft pivot strategy, however, this quarter also included the strategic purchase of 5,800 home sites in Maryland. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 176,000 home sites, of which 141,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our Financial Services business segment had operating earnings of 49.1 million compared to 53.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income decreased to 32.5 million from 38.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were 2.4 billion compared to 2.6 billion last year. Refinanced volume was down 62% compared to the prior year leading to a more competitive origination environment. Refinances now make up only 7% of our total originations. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 80% for the quarter compared to 82% in the prior year. Our title companies profit increased slightly to 15.6 million during the quarter from 15 million in the prior year, and that was driven by a 6% increase in revenue and operating leverage from the higher revenues. Our Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated 1.3 million in profit during the quarter. Stuart provided the multifamily detail, so now I’ll turn to Rialto. The Rialto segment produced operating earnings of 3.2 million compared to 5.9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed 37 million of earnings which [Audio Gap] earnings from real estate funds and 32.3 million of management fees and other which includes 11.4 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate funds one and two now totals 108 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed 236 million of commercial loans into three securitizations resulting in earnings of 12.5 million compared with 491 million and 27.2 million in the prior year, respectively, and that’s before their G&A expenses. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower volume. Our direct investments had a loss of 9.4 million as we continue to make good progress on monetizing the remaining assets from the FDIC and early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were 30.6 million for the quarter and interest expense including the warehouse lines was 6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with 155 million of cash. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4%. The rate is higher than the prior year's third quarter of 31.1% due to the additional energy credits recognized in the prior year. These credits expired on December 31, 2016 and were only available to us for part of this year. Therefore, we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the fourth quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with the net debt to total capital of 39.6%, a decline of 30 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with 565 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our 1.6 billion revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we redeemed early the 250 million of 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. We continue to significantly reduce our cost to capital as we improve our leverage ratio. S&P upgraded our corporate credit rating during the quarter to BB+. Stockholder’s equity increased to 7.6 billion and now our book value per share grew to $32.11 per share. Now I’d like to update our goals for closing out 2017, starting with deliveries. We were right on track to achieve a 90% backlog conversion ratio for the fourth quarter before the storms hit. Using the same backlog conversion ratio and adjusting for the 950 homes that we talked about being pushed into 2018, now calculates to between 8,200 and 8,300 deliveries which is what we are now projecting for the fourth quarter. Based on the projected closings in our backlog, we are increasing our average sales price guidance to between 380,000 and 385,000 for the year. We expect our fourth quarter gross margin percentage to be between 22% and 22.25%. This should bring our full year gross margin percentage to 22%. The fourth quarter gross margin was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points as a result of 950 deliveries being pushed into 2018 and therefore a higher field expense per remaining delivery. Additionally, these deliveries were primarily in Florida which has the highest gross margin percentages in the company. We continue to see improvement in the SG&A line and we should see another record low SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter as we are projecting between 8.5% and 8.6%. Turning to Financial Services, as a result of the significant decline in refinances, lack of resale inventory and the storm impact, our fourth quarter is now projected to be in a range of $35 million to $40 million. Rialto is now expected to generate profits for the fourth quarter of 2 million to 5 million which will bring it to about 25 million for the year. Multifamily is expected to be approximately 35 million to 37 million which will bring it to approximately 70 million for the full year. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income, in this category we’ve been highlighting all year that the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits. The fourth quarter is expected to generate approximately 90 million to 95 million which will bring the full year at the lower end of the previously range that we gave of 70 million to 80 million of profit. Corporate G&A is expected to be 2.1% of total company revenues for the fourth quarter and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. We expect our balance sheet to again end the year with strong liquidity positioning us well as we enter 2018. Let me now turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.
Operator: We will now begin our question-and-answer session for today’s conference. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.
Robert Wetenhall: Good morning and congratulations on delivering some very strong results in a very challenging quarter and thanks for all the terrific detail. Stuart, I was hoping you could spend a minute and talk about ASP growth and the dynamic pricing initiative. It seems like you have a lot of pricing momentum, incentives are all-time lows and that’s a real big tailwind. At the other side you’re going to have some labor constraints and issues with the hurricane rebuild activity. I wanted to understand how Lennar is going to balance those going into the fourth quarter and 2018?
Stuart Miller: Well, let me start and I’m sure that Jon who’s really been spearheading the dynamic pricing and Rick would also want to join in. But dynamic pricing – our dynamic pricing model helps us in a number of ways and really it helps us focus in order to drive margin and even ASP growth. It starts with a proper alignment of our production machine and our sales machine recognizing that as we near completion, it’s time to sell. That has really enabled us to bring down our incentives generally. And as I noted, our incentive levels have come down to the lowest level since 2006 at 5.5%. And I feel that that’s very directly tied to the initiatives in and around our dynamic pricing. Now another part of that is the driving of our inventory levels. We’ve seen a number of our divisions benefit in both generating pricing power and driving down incentives by being able to reduce standing inventory. Standing inventory homes are generally the ones that come with the greatest discounts or the greatest incentives. And getting people tuned in to properly aligning pricing and delivery and clearing inventory earlier has helped that. So, Jon, do you want to add to that?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. The efficient delivery of the homes that Stuart is describing is really enabled by providing our division the data so that they can pull the right levers at the right time to match sales pace with construction pace and as Stuart mentioned the low inventory levels. Last quarter we were down to 1.25 homes per community on average of completed homes that were unsold. I don’t have the data as to whether that’s a record low but I don’t personally remember ever being that low. And by orderly selling the homes through the construction process, having a buyer who’s mortgage approved, ready to close as the home is completed really enables us to reduce the incentives both helping ASP and margins. I’d also want to note that we’ve talked for several years about the impact of our next gen platform and there our sales are up 41% year-over-year and now represents just about 6% of our company’s total sales. That’s also a high mark for next gen sales. And the ASP of next gen is almost 490,000 compared to the company averaging 375,000. So it’s a number of initiatives that I think cumulatively are giving us the results that we speak to.
Rick Beckwitt: So that’s all the good stuff. They left me with the cost side of the equation. And on the cost side of the equation we’re doing our best to hold our trades accountable for the type of cost pricing that we’re looking for. Clearly in this environment where you have people chasing the storm aftermath, there’s some trades and some areas of the business that are tight and where people are going after the easy insurance money. Those are typically in the roofing, the drywall, the siding and depending on the market. That said, we constantly are adjusting sales pace with sales price and the real tricky thing for us at this point is whether we want to really push the trade and pay them more than what the job should really justify in order to accelerate the home or do we take a little bit longer to deliver that home. All of this will work itself out in the next three to six months.
Jon Jaffe: Bottom line, pace and price are really connected and we’re using technologies to refine our processes and it’s impacting in a number of efficiencies; on the cost side, on the incentive side, on the ASP side dropping down the gross margin and a few basis points at a time, we’re making some real progress.
Robert Wetenhall: Yes, those are big strides. My follow-up question was Stuart or maybe the team, could you please give us an operational update where you are in Houston and how you are in Florida and whether WCI’s integration is still on track? And maybe Bruce if you could just flush out a little bit more some of your comments about the pace and cadence of gross margin given the mix shift between communities and the deferral of deliveries into next year? Thanks and good luck. Congratulations on very strong execution.
Rick Beckwitt: Well, you really stack a bunch of questions into one. With regard to Houston and to Florida, let me just address that right now starting with Houston. The Houston market is slowly recovering. All of our communities are open and doing business today. From a trade standpoint, it’s consistent with what I said. Trades are tight in the roofing area, the drywall area as you’d expect because there was a lot of damage associated with the interior of the homes. Folks are – those trades are really chasing that insurance business and it’s slowly getting better. From a power standpoint, we’re really not having any power connection issues in the Texas markets. So that’s a good thing. On the sales side of the market, we’re having good traffic, good solid traffic where people want to buy. The issue is a lot of those folks need to sell a home that’s damaged and they haven’t received the insurance proceeds yet. And as a result it’s going to take a little bit of time for them to get those homes repaired in order for them to buy something and people want to move into areas and communities that haven’t been impacted by this type of weather damage.
Stuart Miller: Not just buy something. Some of them are under contract and were moving towards a closing and the storm now means they’ve got to fix something or get their home ready so that they can sell it and ultimately close on their home. And of course we’re cutting them some slack in this area.
Rick Beckwitt: Right. Of course we are. So that really covers Houston. Florida is sort of a mixture between north and south. In southern Florida, we still do not have the ability to get power connections. And as a result of that, that’s slowing down the business. That will catch its way up. We have not had the ability to press the power companies because quite frankly they need to address other concerns before they do the new home market. We are doing some things that I think are unique. We’re running some conduit between curb and the home in order to accelerate the connection. So when the power companies come out there to do the connects, we should bring things on pretty fast.
Stuart Miller: Let me just interrupt there and say what might be a little counterintuitive to the investor group is the power companies; it would seem that after the power is back on, everything normalizes. But the power companies actually have a pretty comprehensive intercompany agreement to go to where the problems are. So even a problem like the power in Puerto Rico brings some of the manpower from the power companies locally to other areas and impairs their ability to get back up running here in south Florida. So you’re going to continue to see some disruption until many of these storm affected areas are really up running and stabilized.
Jon Jaffe: But one more point of clarity on that. As they fix power to existing areas, much of that is done on a temporary basis to get power up immediately. And so the next course of action for the power company is to come back and permanently fix that. So if there’s a temporary pole put in, they have to come back and put a permanent. All of that takes priority over new home processes.
Rick Beckwitt: Then as you move up to central Florida, we’re seeing that recovering faster. Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville are way ahead of where southeast and southwest Florida are. And then you asked about the pace and cadence in gross margin I believe going into next year, which we have [indiscernible].
Stuart Miller: Yes, which we haven’t commented on that yet but we will with our year-end conference call we’ll give detailed 2018 guidance. Next?
Robert Wetenhall: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: See you later. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Go ahead, please.
Ivy Zelman: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations and a special appreciation to all the Lennar family of getting through for the challenging times. Stuart, I have a question that I get every day from investors and the question is focused around Lennar’s stock performance relative to Horton and Healthy Homes [ph] and they don’t understand why the stock is lagging. I think the best thing that we could talk about I guess to understand it is our focus on returns by both companies and talking about asset light and shifting more to an NVR model. But we obviously saw a decline in your ROE which was related to WCI and obviously you expect that to resume acceleration. But can you talk a little bit about targets around ROE and maybe talk to your expectations and whether or not you’ll do things to improve that level of ROE beyond call it 15% boggy that would actually help stock perform at a better level?
Stuart Miller: Look, first of all, Ivy, in the immediate past I think that we’ve had an unusually large overhang on our stock as it relates to pending storm activity. And I think that’s been the case now for some time. I can’t even tell you how long. But aside from that if you look at our strategy and you look at the way that our company is performing, we’ve been very focused on a growth strategy that targets 7% to 10% rate. But with WCI that’s been trending a little bit higher. We are very focused on cash flow and using cash flow to both pay down debt and ultimately look at stock buyback. But stock buyback comes in a number of different forms. Remember that we had initially targeted WCI to be a 50-50 stock in cash transaction. It ended up being an all cash transaction which was in effect a large stock buyback. It’s fully integrated. It’s well executed. And we’re becoming a real cash flow program and machine which affords us the ability to target transactions to use cash in a variety of ways. And we’re fully confident that as we move forward, our strategies are going to reflect on our returns on equity and on capital perhaps more importantly in very positive and constructive ways. We’ve mapped out our strategy for the Street to consider. The execution has been flowing in course. And I think that over time remembering that we are less focused on quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month stock performance and more concerned and focused on adherence to a strategy that is designed to maximize return on equity, return on capital over a longer period of time, we’re fully confident that our stock performance will continue to be excellent over the long term.
Ivy Zelman: That’s helpful. I think what I want to – and I agree. I think you’re the best right now stock in at least Zelman’s top pick. And what I think is important is people appreciate that you are focused on back to being a pure homebuilder which you said on previous conference calls. And maybe talking about some of the ancillary businesses, obviously the FivePoint expense was a success. So just thinking if you can give us any perspectives on your strategic initiatives getting back to being a pure homebuilder?
Stuart Miller: Yes, so both – as you mentioned, FivePoint we’re there. With regard to multifamily and Rialto we still have I believe a couple of years of maturity and execution to really prepare them for a spin. And I for one simply don’t want to sell cheap. I’m about maximizing shareholder value over longer periods of time. And I think both of these engines, both of these machines have the ability to be best-in-class executions and will afford our shareholders strong values as they mature. LMC is progressing exactly – not exactly, even better than we ever anticipated. If you look at the composition of our apartment communities, the distribution between the merchant build and the build-to-core programs that we have in place, we just have an excellent program of execution ahead over the next couple of years that will define an extraordinary value for that compendium of assets. As it relates to Rialto, we’ve had some bumps in the road which we’ve articulated over time. We still need another couple of quarters to clear those bumps and to start striving forward and we have every confidence that we’ll be able to do that also. But if you look at Rialto as a private equity asset manager and investment manager, if you look at Rialto’s RMF execution, those two isolated go-forward programs are best-in-class. They are blue chip and they will ultimately drive shareholder value. So I think we’re right on course and I think that we have the management patience to execute well over a longer time horizon. The stock market might fluctuate a little bit more on a short-term basis and we’re going to continue to execute our plan. I think the most important thing to focus on is the bandwidth that we have in this company to migrate turbulent waters, to execute our business strategy and to execute across a rather broad platform and I think we’re right on course.
Ivy Zelman: Can I sneak one more in quickly just on the cash flow? Do you envision more M&A and are you looking for opportunities to complement your existing footprint? And thanks for taking my questions guys.
Stuart Miller: We never comment on M&A but we leave all options open. And we think that the cash flow program that we have in place really enables us a broad range of opportunities to be able to access – to be able to execute and to be able to perform and I think that you’ll continue to see us balance between all kinds of possibilities and execute on opportunities. So we’ll leave it at that. And next question?
Ivy Zelman: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Evercore. Go ahead, please.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much guys and good job in the quarter. In particular, it’s helpful that you have taken a stab at trying to quantify the impact of the hurricanes and that’s really where I wanted to spend my first question. And there are a couple of things here so bear with me. You mentioned 50 basis point impact. It wasn’t clear to me whether that was a fourth quarter comment or an annual comment. And then you also mentioned that you were seeing some of your customers in Houston needing to repair their homes. And that sort of brings to mind this question of what the fade of the margin impact you think ultimately may be? And I know you’re not going to get specific until later, but I’m interested in sort of what things you are likely to put into that bucket on hurricane affected margin? For instance, when you have people who may have lost more equity than they anticipated in their home because it was flooded in Houston and then he dropped out if there’s any cancellations that’s been out of that, would that be something that would show up? If you have to pay extra for labor, are you going to try to quantify the amount you’re paying extra for labor or is it simply going to be we think maybe we lost some sales total and what impact we think that has on our overhead at the project level? If you can just help us think about how you’re thinking about quantifying the hurricane-related affects on your margin?
Stuart Miller: Bruce is going to jump in and talk a little bit more about the margin effect, but before he gets to that let me just jump in on this notion of fade. I think it’s going to take some time to actually ferret some of this out. But overall long term, given the loss of residences in a generally constrained market to begin with, you’re more likely to see a supply shortage that as homes get repaired, there’s really very little fade in terms of value and pricing. As homes get repaired, the value comes back and I think that you’re going to see a shorter term negative turn into a longer term positive and that’s traditionally what we’ve seen in storm affected areas through many decades of having dealt with it. It takes a little bit of time for things to get back on their feet. And as we talked about the loss of or the postponement push of some closings from fourth quarter into 2018 and some directly related to homes to sell that have to repaired and ultimately brought on line, those homes will get repaired. They will be sold probably at the price that was expected with very little re-trade and I don’t think that that will be the impact to margin, if anything. It will probably come around and lift the ability to raise prices maybe with some offset from cost on the labor and material front. But, Bruce, go ahead.
Bruce Gross: In your first question, the 50 basis points that I highlighted, that’s purely the impact related to the fourth quarter by pushing out 950 deliveries and the impact with less volume that field expense is going to be higher per remaining unit. So that’s just the impact for Q4.
Stephen Kim: Okay, got it. And so I guess by implication and that means that you’re probably going to be at the lower end of your margin expected range for the year, excluding the hurricanes, I guess would be the implication from that. I guess – the question that I had – my second question really relates to the technology and the role of technology on your results in your gross margin and SG&A. Obviously, it’s been really impressive. It’s been – and I know that you’ve been out in front and have been very active and continue to be active in ways that your competitors are not. And I guess my question relates to what you think – what inning do you think we are in, in terms of not necessarily digital marketing and dynamic pricing per se, but the ability of the technology initiatives that you see on the table right now being able to benefit the margin structure of your business over the next few years, like what inning do you think we are in? And what do you think the first-mover advantages are in these technology-related investments? Like how much can you keep do you think relative to your competition?
Stuart Miller: So if you’ve ever been to a baseball game, you’re begging a baseball metaphor here. Have you ever noticed that people warm up before the game actually starts? That’s the inning that I think we’re in.
Rick Beckwitt: In a minor league game.
Stuart Miller: I think this is just getting started and there’s a big, big range of opportunity in the technology field to refine the homebuilding business that has only started – we’ve only started to prick the surface of some of these areas and we are really invigorated by it both myself, Jon, Rick and our whole management team are really focused on this. And I would encourage you at some point to – when you’re down here, Steve, to come visit and make sure that you see our innovation center which we’ve done on our third floor here. We are fully focused on thinking about how technologies can create efficiencies through our system in every part of our business and we think that there’s a long way to go. Your question of course is how much room is there to enhance SG&A or to bring SG&A down? And I can’t quantify that right now. But I think we’ve just started to figure out how to really build that better mousetrap that I keep talking about. Now your next question is to what extent is there a first-mover advantage? I’m not going to say a first-mover advantage because I believe that others can learn and jump on board. But it’s not about first-mover advantage. It’s about incorporating these technologies is hard, hard work. It’s hard work to learn and understand how they work and then to transport that knowledge out to multiple divisions in multiple geographies is a very complex management engagement and it’s something that we work on every day. So as you’ve watched the improvement of migrating from conventional to digital marketing, that seems like a kind of binary, oh, let’s just make a movement but it has come with a learning curve, a testing curve, a proven curve and then an implementation curve that is really difficult to overcome. So it’s not a first-mover advantage in a traditional sense. It’s the sooner you start, the more time you’ve put behind you in doing the hard work and the heavy lifting that it takes to actually implement these programs. So our work is not to run to get ahead of others, it’s to move hard, work hard every single day to implement and to garner that 1, 2 or 10 basis points per week, per month, per quarter of improvement that we’ve been articulating as we’ve gone through the past years.
Jon Jaffe: I do think though that as each initiative goes through that process that Stuart described of testing and ultimately into implementation which is as rigorous as he described, it gets easier and easier as time goes on, as people understand the benefits of these technologies, the change in management aspect of that is easier to address and to incorporate the 2.0 version and 3.0 version. So I think that whether it’s first mover or not, it’s sooner you get started the sooner you’re going to get to better and better execution of new technologies.
Stuart Miller: But I don’t think somebody can come along and just pick up and copy what we’ve done and say, okay, now we’ve got the answer so we can get the answers right on the test. The implementation is the hard part.
Stephen Kim: Got it. That’s very helpful and very thorough. I appreciate it. And if anybody’s going to get it done, it will be you guys, so that’s great. Thanks, guys.
Stuart Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning or now I guess it’s afternoon. Nice results and congrats on getting through all the challenges weather-related obviously. It was huge undertaking I’m sure. First question, Stuart, I wanted to circle back to the comments you had in your press release actually and I believe you had this even on your initial prior release around estimations of impact. And you said in the release again today was that you expect an increased demand in homes in the storm-related areas which will result in a broader range of opportunities as we look towards 2018. So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective when you think about the impact of the storms and I think you’ve alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it’s more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera. Certainly there might be some incremental demand for new homes in terms of maybe people wanting to move out of a damaged home. But just wanted to get a sense for – you said you’ve been through this before. What specifically – is there any expectation in terms of maybe incremental new home demand going up 5%, 10%, 15% in the respective states or is it more of a broader statement? And when you say a broader range of opportunities, if there are certain specific types of initiatives or certain types of communities or pivoting or maybe for multifamily, what exactly do you mean by that?
Rick Beckwitt: It’s Rick. Why don’t I take a stab at it and then Stuart and Jon can chime in. There’s several aspects of this that are just different pieces. One is just the overall new capital investment as you’re rebuilding various markets. There’s going to be tremendous capital invested in infrastructure that’s going to create new jobs, that’s going to create wage growth, that’s going to allow people to just have more spend as they’re looking at buying homes just in general. The second aspect of it is as you look at where the storms hit, particularly in Houston – let’s just focus on Houston right now. There’s going to be parts of the market where FEMA will shut down and will not allow homes to be built in those areas. As a result of that for folks like us to have a lot of land in other parts of the market, more the upland areas, that’s going to create over time just long-term fundamental demand. The other aspect of it and I put this sort of in both markets, the Florida markets and the Houston markets, as you look at what happened with regard to the storms, the newer homes, the newer production, the newer construction faired so much better than the used home market, the existing market. As a result of that you’re seeing a continued shift of people saying, I’d rather live in something that’s going to weather the storm than be impacted by the storm again and again. So those are just a few aspects of the opportunities that exist out there that creates that longer term fundamental demand in the aftermath of these storms.
Jon Jaffe: And that’s the pattern we’ve seen in prior storms on your question about experiences. It’s sort of fundamentally a reallocation of capital from insurance companies to local economies that drive those local economies trading, as Rick said wage growth, job growth and demand for housing. That combined with a shortage from homes temporarily taken out of the market generally bode well for a mid-term housing market recovery.
Stuart Miller: The infusion of capital into these markets, even those that don’t seem to have been affected that much is a sharpening arm to people who are thinking about buying, moving up, trading and it just stimulates the economy in the long run.
Michael Rehaut: That’s helpful. I appreciate all the color there. Second question on the gross margin guidance. I guess you’ve identified that of the 22 to 22.25, 50 bips of an impact from deliveries. And then you also mentioned a negative gross margin mix from the delayed Florida deliveries. A couple of questions here on this I guess just to understand. Was the negative gross margin mix in addition to that 50 bip impact from the delayed closings which sounded like a little bit more of negative fixed cost absorption? And if so or if it’s not, it seems like the prior guidance was pointing to a 4Q gross margin in the high 23s. So just was curious what changed outside of the 50 bip hit, because also obviously your 3Q gross margin came in above expectations. So just curious if there was other shifts going around or what really fully impacted on top of the hurricane hit, the gross margin outlook?
Stuart Miller: I’ll explain the 50 basis points again. The reason for the 50 basis points was both for the 950 deliveries being pushed which took into account the fact that they were higher margin Florida deliveries that were being pushed. So the remaining deliveries on an average basis would have a lower gross margin percentage as well as the impact to losing some leverage in field expense. So that’s already embedded in the 50 basis points that I described.
Bruce Gross: The mix of that’s about half and half between the margin mix and the additional cost that we don’t have, the ability to leverage that over more closings.
Michael Rehaut: So what would then by the difference in terms of the prior guidance in the high 23s?
Stuart Miller: We did have a range for the year, Mike. So we still are ending up with the range that we had for the year, the lower end of that range of the guidance that we gave previously.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. And then just one clarification. The 300 to 385 ASP; that was not for the fourth quarter, that was for the full year?
Stuart Miller: No, that was for the fourth quarter.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: Let’s take one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Go ahead, please.
Paul Przybylski: This is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. Going back to the gross margin question again, do you feel like that mid-22% range is normalized? And then should we expect a swing of the 50 basis points to show up in the first quarter of '18?
Bruce Gross: It’s so tough to make a prediction on where normalized margins are right now in the context of where the trade basis out there are like at the moment. And I think we’re going to have to see what happens with regard to them rebuilding themselves, where they’re focused on, what activities are out there and how the power side of the equation comes back to the market. It’s a little bit too soon to be commenting on that.
Stuart Miller: I think that we don’t want to give kneejerk guidance. And the bottom line is in the middle of turmoil, it would be easy to try to give something and then not be able to live up to it. I think we’re going to have to let these markets settle a little bit. ASP is going to be affected. Incentives are going to be affected. Construction costs on labor are going to be affected. And we’re going to let the market settle a little bit before we give more guidance into 2018. But we feel pretty good about the business overall.
Paul Przybylski: Okay. Then what kind of impact you expect from the storms on development? Do you think that might delay some community openings that could maybe cause your top line to come in towards the lower end of expectations?
Stuart Miller: When you have a lot of water and wind come through a certain area, you got delays. There’s no question about that. And what we’re trying to do is manage our business as efficiently and effectively as we can. Jon and I tell the guys all the time, we don’t want a weather report; we’re looking for execution. So I’m not here to give you a weather report at this point in time, but there’s no question we will encounter some delays. That’s going to be with regard to getting some materials. Pipe is pretty tight right now. In addition to that there’s just been a slowdown on the overall inspections as both the municipalities are focused on other infrastructure things that are more compelling to get up and running.
Paul Przybylski: Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Okay. With that, thanks everyone for joining us and we look forward to updating you with our fourth quarter conference call. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: I'd like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great, thank you, David. This morning, I'm with Rick Beckwitt, our President; Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, who you just heard from. And we also have Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto here and Eric Feder, from the Rialto Group; John Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; is also with us by phone from California and will participate in the Q&A portion.  As always, I am going to start with a brief overview, Bruce will deliver further detail, and we’d like to ask that during the Q&A portion that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible in the hour allotted.  So let me go ahead and begin by saying that we are very pleased to announce a very strong earnings for the second quarter, with strong and balance results being reported by each of our operating segments. While in our first quarter, we noted that the somewhat sluggish overhang from the end of 2016 had negatively impacted margins and therefore our operating results.  We felt that the market was improving, as sales picked up throughout the first quarter. We anticipated that the spring selling season would be solid and that we would in fact see improved results as the year progress. These are exactly the conditions that drove our results for the second quarter.  We have continued to see strength in the housing market through the second quarter and have seen new orders, home deliveries and margins exceed our initial expectations. Generally speaking, in spite of the often noisy political environment, there continues to be a general sense of optimism in the market, there continues to be a perception that jobs are being created across the country and that wages are generally moving positively. We often discussed labor shortage in many sectors of the economy is translating into a sense that many job sectors compensation is moving up and while much of the data collected by the government doesn’t seem to reflect significant wage growth. The customers visiting our welcome home centers are reflecting an optimistic sentiment.  There continues to be a general sentiment that the business environment is positive and that the governmental pro-business environment will result in at least job security and possibly some tax relief as well. Overall, the attitude of our customers continues to confirm the sense that we have as business operators that the economic environment in general is strong and stable and improving. The slow and steady though sometimes erratic market improvement that we have seen for the entirety of this recovery continues to seem to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal.  We continue to feel that limited supply and production deficits from the past years are now intersecting with land and labor shortage and we started to see some pricing power as we have moved through the selling season, somewhat offset however by construction costs increases. Additionally the economic realities of a constrained and supply of housing options and the economic realities of higher rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision making for the first time home buyer as millennials are continuing to come to the housing market.  Across our platform each of our business segments benefits from the overall improvement in the market as we look ahead through the remainder of 2017. We are expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow to mature and to improve as we enter the back half of the year.  Against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. To begin, our for sale core homebuilding operations continue to be extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Deliveries for the first quarter increased 15% and our gross and net margins improved 40 basis points and 130 basis points sequentially. In the second quarter, new orders were up approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by higher sales pace of four homes per community per month versus 3.9 last year, combined with a community count growth of some 6%. Interestingly, our strongest markets Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay area, Tampa and Southeast Florida, all had a sales pace of over five homes per community per month. We continue to gain stronger results, powered by our focused strategy on driving better quality traffic to our digital marketing efforts. Today, our social media outreach generates internet leads that now surpass 100,000 per quarter. And that is driving our marketing and advertising spend, which is now down year-over-year for 10 consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of operating efficiency and we're continuing to focus on improving from here.  Alongside our digital marketing effort, another example of one of our technology initiatives is the implementation of our dynamic pricing tool. This technology provides a dashboard for real-time matching of deliverable inventory so that it can be priced and delivered more efficiently. We saw the power and success of the dynamic pricing tool during this quarter as we exceeded home delivery expectations by reducing our completed unsold inventory by 17% without sacrificing margin. As you've heard from us in prior quarters, we're using various technology initiatives to dramatically improve our operating model, fueled by our digital marketing efforts, our dynamic pricing tool and other technology initiatives as well. We continue to focus on overall operational efficiency driving our SG&A to historic lows for our first quarter and now for our second quarter as well. We're simply building a better mousetrap one technology at a time.  In addition, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and the integration, which is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team led by Fred Rothman and Darren McMurray is progressing exactly as planned. WCI will continue to contribute to earnings as expected as purchase accounting and non-recurring cost dissipate and as cost benefits and SG&A savings accumulate.  Overall, our core homebuilding strategy remains to pivot our land strategy towards shorter term land acquisitions and to maintain a 7% to 10% growth rate for the company, while we enhance our operating platform by reducing SG&A. Parenthetically, given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rate should be on the higher side or little bit overall goal for the year.  Additionally, we are focused on expanding our first time homebuyer offering with our mix now standing right at around 40%. Combined, these strategies -- these strategic elements will produce very strong cash flow for the company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement. Let me turn briefly to our Financial Services segment. As you've seen, our Financial Services segment is continuing to perform well in the second quarter as it contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million. Of course, the business is growing and lockstep with our homebuilding operations and with the addition of the WCI acquisition as the refi business has diminished over the past year Lennar Financial Services is continuing to expand its non-Lennar business reach and bottom-line to replace those earnings. Bruce, who oversees this operation will give additional color in just a few minutes.  LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, our Multifamily Apartment segment has continue to grow and exceed expectations. LMC generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter driven by the sale of one of our merchant build apartment communities. While we have continued with the development of our merchant build communities, we also have grown LMV our build-to-core program, which is cash flow focused on building an apartment portfolio. In the second quarter, we started 1,140 apartment homes in 4 communities, with the total development cost of approximately $520 million. As of May 31st, we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $8.2 billion. These included 37 merchant build communities totaling approximately 12,000 apartments with a total development cost of $4.1 billion. And 39 LMV build-to-core communities totaling approximately 11,600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $4.1 billion. Our Multifamily platform continues to grow and to perform beyond our projections and expectations. Turning to Rialto, Rialto contributed $6.2 million to the bottom-line this quarter versus a loss a year ago. Rialto's investment and asset management platform has continued to grow its asset base as well as harvest value for investors and for us. Our first two flagship opportunity funds continue to be top quartile performers. We are also pleased that our third opportunistic fund held its final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and it has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions involving the investment of over $600 million of equity. And to complement our opportunistic funds, we also have over $1.1 billion of investor equity dedicated to investment CMBS, mezzanine and transactional lending, which we also will be looking to grow this year. On the Rialto Mortgage Finance side of the business, market conditions have continued to be favorable for RMF, which has maintained its position as one of the largest and most profitable non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 39th and 40th securitization transactions during this quarter with net margins averaging 5.8% selling over $392 million of RMF originated loans. Our direct investments should be winding down over the next quarters as the remaining assets are monetized and cash is recycled into our higher returning businesses. Going forward from that point our focus will be solely on our investment management and RMF business segments there. Finally, FivePoint successfully completed its IPO this quarter and now enters the public market as a pure play California, master plan community developer. We expected overtime the value embedded in the FivePoint management team and its extraordinary asset base will be realized as the appreciation cycle of these extremely well located communities will be revealed through transparency and public filings. Certainly from a Lennar perspective the new stock symbol FPH will afford Lennar shareholders greater transparency to this part of our balance sheet. Finally in conclusion, across the platform, our company is very pleased with the accomplishments of our second quarter and we're feeling very optimistic about the reminder of the year. We are clearly well positioned to capitalize across the platform on the strong market conditions that have materialized and seem to define the market in the near future.  Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform and strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all align to perform in 2017 and we look forward to keeping you updated. So with that let me turn over for greater detail to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $213.6 million or $0.91 per diluted share and this compares to second quarter 2016 net earnings or $218.5 million or $0.95 per diluted share, which included a favorable $0.02 per diluted share impact due to a lower 32.2% tax rate as a result of energy credits available in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 18% in the second quarter, driven by a 15% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average selling price to $374,000. As Stuart highlighted, our Homebuilding team used our new technologies and a strong sales season to focus on selling deliverable inventories. This resulted in a significant increase in our expected backlog conversion ratio to 86% for the quarter. Additionally our completed unsold home inventory dropped by 224 homes or 17% sequentially from the first quarter. This focus on deliverable inventory resulted in an acceleration of home deliveries that were previously expected in our third quarter.  WCI contributed 388 deliveries to the quarter and that was about 70 more than were expected. Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 21.5%. We are on track with our previously stated goal of 22% to 22.5% gross margins for the full year. The prior year’s gross margin was 23.1% and the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 20 basis points due to write up of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the quarter.  Sales incentives year-over-year were consistent 5.7%, but improved sequentially by 20 basis points from our first quarter. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot, driven by an approximate 7% increase in labor and 4% in material costs, driven primarily by lumber. Our SG&A percent in the second quarter, was consistent with the prior year at 9.3%, which was a record low. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from our focus on our technology investments through the company. Included in our SG&A for the second quarter were transaction related expenses to the WCI acquisition, which had a 20 basis points impact.  Other income net was $3.8 million compared to $13.7 million in the prior year. In the prior year we did have a profit participation from one of our homebuilding consolidated joint ventures that drove most of that profit. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $21.5 million, which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incur general and administrative expenses, while ramping up for future land sales. We opened 86 new communities during the quarter and closed 102 communities, to end the quarter with 736 net active communities.  We continued with our soft pivot strategy as we’ve purchased only 7,500 home sites, totaling $371 million in the second quarter and our home site count owned and controlled now totals 167,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 31,000 and controlled. Our Financial Services business had strong results, with operating earnings of $43.7 million compared to $44.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income decreased slightly to $32 million from $36.8 million in the prior year, mortgage originations were $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year.  Refinanced volume was down 48% compared to the prior year, leading to a more competitive origination environment. The capture rate of Lennar home buyers was 80% compared to 83% in the prior year.  Our title companies profit increased to $9.7 million during the quarter from $7.4 million in the prior year, driven by an 8% increase in revenue and operating leverage from these higher revenues. And then our new Florida realty brokerage operation acquired from WCI generated $2.2 million of profit during the quarter. The spring selling season quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for this business. More detail on Rialto, this segment produced $6.2 million compared to last year’s loss of $13.8 million both years are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed $42 million of net earnings, which included $5.8 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and, and $36.3 million of management fees and other, which includes $11 million of carried interest distributions. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate funds one and two now totals $119 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $392 million of commercial loans into two securitizations, resulting in earnings of $15.6 million compared with $386 million and $12.7 million in the prior year respectively. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the average net margins and the securitizations from 3.6% in the prior year to 4.2% in the current year. Our direct investments had a loss of $13 million, as we continue to focus on monetizing the remaining assets from the early portfolio purchases. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $32.1 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.3 million. Rialto ended the quarter with the strong liquidity position with $120 million of cash. The Multifamily segment delivered a $6.5 million operating profit during the quarter primarily driven by the segment’s $11.4 million share of gains from the one operating property that was sold, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, which included a favorable resolution with the IRS. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 32.2% due to the energy credits in the prior year. And we expect the tax rate to be approximately 34% for the remainder of this year.  Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remained strong with the net debt-to-total capital of 40.7%, a decline of 280 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with $748 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This facility was amended during the quarter to extend out to five years and to increase the commitments to $2 billion, which includes a $400 million of accordion feature.  During the quarter, we retired our 12.25% senior note maturity of $400 million, which was due June 1st, with the proceeds from our new issuance of $650 million of 4.5% seven year senior notes. This results in an annual net cash interest savings of $31 million per year. We intend to use the balance of the proceeds to redeem the 6.875% senior notes that were acquired with the WCI transaction. This redemption will likely occur at the next call date in August. Stockholders' equity increased to $7.3 billion and our book value per share reached $31.23 per share.  Now I would like to update our goals for 2017. We are right on track to deliver between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. Given that we accelerated closings from Q3 into Q2, there is a smaller population of homes available for delivery in Q3, and therefore we expect the backlog conversion ratio to be similar to 2016 second half conversion ratios, which was 75% for the third quarter and close to 90% for the fourth quarter. We are increasing our average sales price guidance to between $370,000 and $375,000 for the year. We are still on track to hit our expected operating margins of around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is still expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect our third quarter gross margin percentage to between 21.75% and 22%. We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line to be between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. The third quarter will have some non-recurring transition cost relating to the WCI transaction and therefore we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.3% again in the third quarter. The fourth quarter however should realize the largest leverage given our higher expected volume for the fourth quarter. Financial Services despite a large decline in refis we are on track with our financial services goal of $160 million for the year, with the third quarter expected to be $45 million to $50 million. Turning to Rialto, Rialto is now expected to generate profits of approximately $30 million for the year, with the third quarter expected to be in a range of $3 million to $5 million. Multifamily is still on track to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year, the third quarter is expected to be approximately $5 million of that number. And joint ventures land sales and other income, as we look at this combined category, we still expect to range at $70 million to $80 million of profit for the full year. The third quarter is expected to be profitable in the range of $0 million to $5 million and the fourth quarter will generate the bulk of the profits in this category. Corporate G&A is on track to still be 2.2% to 2.3% of total company revenues for the year and our community count is still expected to be approximately 770 to 780 communities. The balance sheet is well positioned to end the year with strong liquidity and similar leverage as 2016. So as you can see we are well positioned to achieve our goals for the remainder of 2017. So with that, let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ivy Zelman. Your line is now open.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you, good morning guys, congratulations another solid quarter. Stuart you mentioned in your opening comments that roughly 40% of the business was really geared at the entry level segment and just talking about what’s happening from a pricing perspective, there has been an acceleration in pricing really throughout the year from January to through the spring selling season give the strength. Is there a level of price appreciation that can concern you as affordability is still attractive. I mean how much run rate do you think you have, you mentioned your technology on pricing. Maybe you can give us some flavor around an apples-to-apples comparison what you are seeing in the start of market. As I hear lot of questions about concerns about the rapid rising appreciation and concerns that it may look like ‘13 when the market got to agree just [ph] and pricing was getting a little ahead of its ski. So if you can comment there and then I have a follow-up. Thanks again.
Stuart Miller : Sure, look I think that -- I think it’s clear pricing has been moving up and even the line between first time and move up buyer is starting to get a little blurry and has been moving up over the past couple of years. I think that -- I am going to turn over to Rick and Jon to give some color from the field. I think generally speaking we are seeing that people though the pricing is moving up people are finding that the affordability from employment wage growth and general economic factors is increasing as well and enabling people to come to the market. Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, hi Ivy, so if you look at the quarter, our sales prices were up about 5% on overall aggregate basis and granted some of that impacted by mix. But as you look at the entry level product that we’re dealing in our major markets, we’re able to offset the efficiencies production associated with the price increases in those communities. So we are having a pretty well balanced program right now and really on track with the underwriting that we’ve had. 
Stuart Miller: John, you want to weigh in on that.
Jon Jaffe: Yes I would just echo that the consumer sentiment is really a driving factor right now and we’re not seeing spikes in appreciation that are causing concerns and we’re really not seeing that at the mortgage table. So, I think it’s typical housing follows jobs and wages and that’s really a tailwind that we have right now.
Ivy Zelman: Great. And my follow-up Stuart, the question for Stuart as it relates to sort of capacity knowing that the U.S. housing market is still significant deficit what's needed shelter for single family and retail is extremely tight and very constraint with days on market falling below 30 days according to NAR. One question comes up a lot in meetings as you'll hear from clients is, okay, now all the builders you're the prettiest growth advance if you're building within the FHA loan mermaid and there is not enough supply so everybody is going there. From your perspective, is there a room and depth for now the industry all rushing to go to the BE and even see rings of the market and give us some comfort that there is not going to get a crowding situation or saturation.
Stuart Miller: I think there are some governors out there IV and we've mentioned this in past conference calls. I think there is the limitation on land availability, land pricing that yields to affordable housing. I think there are labor shortages generally. I think that while demand is continuing to grow, I think there are some limiters on how quickly the production can keep up and can expand to meet that demand. The question is to whether there is going to be a flood to B and C locations, there are certainly more demand for those locations as the market expands. As we've highlighted before, it's our strategies to stay inside those outskirts. And so we think that our strategy is really well crafted for where the market is going and we certainly don't want to get way out on the outer trenches. Rick you want to add to that?
Rick Beckwitt : Yes, and it's all about the overall land strategy. We try to stay ahead of where the market is going. I’d like the think that we're one or two steps ahead of where the industry is. And as a result, we've tied up as we've talked about in the past. A lot of contiguous land through option contracts that put us in a good position as the market evolves. 
Ivy Zelman: Okay, great. Good luck guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. 
Rick Beckwitt : Sure. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Robert Wetenhall: Hey, good morning. Tremendous quarter. Wanted to ask Stuart and Rick and Jon, how much operating leverage is left in the model? You called out dynamic pricing, you're obviously having great success leveraging the SG&A side of the business with some of the new social marketing initiatives you're undertaking. What's left, because you guys made great strides in the short amount of time. It seems like all levers are working in the business. Can you get a better net margin in say the next 18 months or two years due to the fact that you got favorable operating leverage, the pricing environment seems benign, if not outright positive. And you're doing a great job of leveraging the cost structure. What's left to extract from the business in terms of net margin in the current environment?
Stuart Miller: So Bob, I would turn the sentiment around and say that we feel that we're at the very beginning stages. We are articulating our successes relative to digital marketing and now dynamic pricing because we can point to some tangible effects that people can latch on to. But this is a big strategic initiative within the company. We feel that we're at the very early stages, very early innings of what I said in my comments building a better mousetrap. We think that there is a lot more leverage. I think it arrives from a lot of smaller initiatives adding up overtime. And as they become more provable, we'll start to put them on the table. I don't want to start getting out over my skies or creating false optimism it has been done before. But as we prove these up, we're talking about them a little bit more. I think that many know, many people know that this is a very big strategic focus for the company. And we think that we can produce a lot of operating leverage and bring our operating margins up. I don't want to quantify it, but we don't think it's tens of basis points we think it's much bigger than that and it will be overtime. 
Robert Wetenhall: That's good to know, thank you. And for a follow-up question, you guys have the successful IPO of FivePoint earlier this year, and it seems like some of the ancillary businesses are maturing nicely and I wanted to ask you Stuart, what's your vision of the business in say the end of 2018 or 2019, you've called out a reversion to pure play as a homebuilder back to day six? And it seems like the other ancillary businesses are maturing nicely. How do we think about the trajectory of how this plays out in say the next 18 to 24 months, what are your expectations? Thanks and good luck.
Stuart Miller : Thank you. So, we’ve highlighted in past conference calls that we’re very focused on reverting to pure play to the pure play homebuilding model. Of course we’ve talked about the IPO of FivePoint, we think that brings growth transparency and visibility. But we’re working every day on some of the other components of our business. You've heard us talk a lot about LMC or multifamily apartment rental program, that program as we move through our merchant build assets and migrate towards our build-to-core strategy this sets up an opportunity for us to maintain this strategy within the company if it strategically make sense as a core asset or to do some kind of alternative transaction and that can very well happen over the next couple of years. On the Rialto side, you’ve seen the buildup of our investment management business, you seen the buildup and execution around Rialto Mortgage Finance and you are seeing a very focused strategy on liquidating our core holdings our assets that where we invested Rialto capital. So that we're going to reduce that business to just those two core business lines of RMF and investment management. And as we do that we come to the end of 2017 the next few quarters, we're really going to have something that will be able to be either combined IPO or spun out and we look forward to doing that over the next couple of years as well. So, we think as we look forward expect to see a refined pure play homebuilder over the next couple of years.
Robert Wetenhall: Got it. Thanks and good luck.
Stuart Miller : Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Trainor: Hi, this is Anthony Trainor filling in for Mike. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. So, just wanted to talk a little bit about this gross margin ramp in the second half. Is there any way you can provide kind of the puts and takes around what’s driving the step up from 2Q to 3Q and then kind of how you guys get from 3Q or 4Q in order to maintain this for you guys any type of -- anything you can help us in terms of the bridge there would be great.
Bruce Gross: Probably the biggest impact on margin is the amount of field expenses that are absorbed given the increased volume closings. That combined with the fact that generally we enter the year with a little bit lower sales pace and we’re able to push pricing throughout the year. It's a very typical seasonal pattern.
Anthony Trainor: Great. And then I guess there was further follow-up, you mentioned that the East has the highest gross margin percentage, do you have what the Central gross margin percentage is relative to the full company. Because given that backlog value in the Central region is not down year-on-year. That should be a smaller portion of revenues in the second half.
Stuart Miller : We haven’t broken that out by region, but that’s something on a follow-up I could certainly talk though with you.
Anthony Trainor: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Buck Horne: Hey, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask a strategic question of sorts pretty well known a competitor has made a pretty intriguing strong different external land development platform. And I’m kind of curious how you see the market over the next couple of years for land development and finished lots evolving. And would it make some senses for Lennar to develop its own external platform or partnership for finished lots notwithstanding the relationship with FivePoint in California.
Stuart Miller : So, I think you are talking about the four star news that's out there as those of you that don't know Starwood Capital has that as a merger agreement to acquire that company. Another builder has recently announced that they have an interest in trying to put something together that buys the majority of the company and run it as a land bank type of machine that would feed that company. It’s an interesting set of cards, we really don’t want to comment on the viability of that platform or the stub piece that would trade in the market, but as we look at we have had absolutely no problem sourcing land. We do a lot of partnerships and have a tremendous depth of connectivity with the land sellers and land developers out there. And we think that we’re going to continue down our path and continue to grow the company.
Buck Horne: That’s perfect. Now that’s exactly what I was trying to ask about, so I appreciate you’re reading through those lines. And last, I’d like to just go back to WCI, just for a second. How do you see the integration, I guess, progressing from here in terms of growth plans or acceleration of community activity and maybe if you can add some color about what you’d like to do with the WCI tower pads going forward as well?
Rick Beckwitt: Well on the integration front, as Stuart said, we’re exactly where we planned again if not a little bit ahead of schedule, the only integration that’s left is really some backend IT stuff the fine tuning on integrating the accounting and control assumptions. Although from an operating standpoint we are one company right now, we’re continuing with the WCI brand because we think that there has been increased ASP growth on those communities.  From a targeted standpoint with regard to the pads, we have one of the towers under construction right now, that’s doing really well, once we entered the sales season. And our plan is to -- if the market is there to continue to build and develop out that business. WCI is a power house in those markets and with our expertise especially on our multifamily side since we do a lot of high rise in the multifamily business. Now we are able to arbitrage costs that will make that business even stronger. 
Stuart Miller : Let me just add to that and say WCI really is a textbook merger and combination integration story, it happened very quickly, very efficiently. We are as Rick says up, we are one company at this point. The positive side of that is that we have clean and clear operating strategies going forward. And the two pronged programs that lead to the best operating results and that is the ability to apply our construction cost preferred customer approach to dealing with subcontractors is really going to benefit the WCI business going forward. And the SG&A leverage that we have been improving on the Lennar platform, we think better than others is going to help leverage the additional volume that we see from WCI in the future, getting the integration behind us quickly and efficiently really enables us to take advantage of those two strategic advantages. And we think we’re going to see that going forward.
Buck Horne: That’s great, thank you very much for the comments. 
Stuart Miller : You bet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. 
Stephen East: Thank you and good morning everybody. Bruce you talked about expected strong cash flow this year, could you give us an idea of what type of magnitude you’re talking about this year and next year and as you all rank quarter your options for that kind of usage of that cash?
Bruce Gross: So let me start, we haven’t given next year’s numbers out yet, although we expect next year to be strong as well. But for this year we talked about approximately $0.5 billion of operating cash flow and one of the things we said at the beginning of the year as we were comfortable paying all cash for WCI and that was a $643 million acquisition. So that was one of the primary uses of the operating cash flow for this year. We expect the leverage by the end of the year to be similar to the prior year so that will put us in really good shape as we enter '18 and we'll give that updated guidance in our fourth quarter.
Stephen East: Okay, fair enough. 
Stuart Miller : So [indiscernible] Steve, we are very focused on cash flow generation. And focused on really improving the balance sheet as we go forward.
Stephen East: Okay. And along those lines Stuart, I guess I'll ask a different version of Buck's question. When you look at FivePoint do you see a vehicle that in this cycle could expand away from California and into other parts of the country and maybe act as a partner with you to maybe continue or accelerate your soft pivot somewhat?
Stuart Miller: That's -- first of all FivePoint today is a strong independent company with a strong Chief Executive Officer, Emile Haddad. And I certainly don't want to take away from his articulation of strategy. But having been on the road show with him now for a few weeks I do feel that I can comfortably say that FivePoint strategy is to remain focused as a California pure play master plan community focused developer. It has a strong complement of assets that it is focused on today. And it's not going to be distracted by a land strategy for Lennar or any other builder across the country. It's going to stick to its core competence. We endorse that strategy for FivePoint, we think that's how they're going to drive bottom-line and execute their strategy in the public markets as they've articulated it. So they are -- for those who might think about the Four Star strategy and applying that to a FivePoint that’s just simply not our thinking about strategy nor is it the articulated strategy of FivePoint. 
Stephen East: Fair enough, that's extremely helpful. And if I could sneak one other in, you all have talked in the past reducing floor plans, your labor hours with technology becoming more of a manufacturing process et cetera. Do you see with the labor issues continuing and probably continuing for good chunk of this cycle. Do you see a fundamental change in the way you build i.e., more penalization modular whatever the case maybe.
Stuart Miller: Jon leads that, a lot of that effort and he has done extraordinary work there. Jon, why don't you take that?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. Really, we explored those options every day, we have a supply chain team that's very focused from the beginning of the process through the end. There really hasn't been a realization in the area of modular or prefabing, but yes, we continue to explore that. The opportunities that we're seeing are really eliminating the waste that’s in the supply chain by forming very close relationships with the suppliers and manufacturers and recalibrating that to drive some efficiencies. And that's what we see over the near to medium term and perhaps longer term there will be some technologies that enable some change. But remember, our factories out in the field home site by home site. So it doesn't lend itself the same way that some other manufacturing processes do to the advance of technologies. 
Stuart Miller: Within our environment, we've really engineered and Jon has sphere headed using our everything included marketing strategy as a mechanism for creating Lennar as a builder of choice among subcontractors. And we've built a lot of partnership to be able to strategize in how we can breed efficiencies into our building process and our cost structure. And I think we've made some meaningful inroads along those lines.
Stephen East: Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate that Stuart. 
Stuart Miller: You bet. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is open. 
Jack Micenko: Hi, thanks for taking the question. With the FivePoint ownership, obviously you brought into some more on the deal. It might be a technical question, but I think it has ramifications to the bigger Lennar story that’s kind is some of the part story. You didn't step up the value of FivePoint on your balance sheet. I know it's a long-term position, how do we think about how you realize that value now it's a public traded entity longer term the value that position?
Stuart Miller : Well, look, number one I think that transparency associated with FivePoint being a public company. That really helps our shareholder base understand its horsepower. Now that story is going to evolve over the next quarters and years as residential lands are sold, as infrastructure improvements add to value, as the cycle of appreciation embedded in master plan communities really reveals itself through quarterly conference calls and accomplishments.  Our shareholders are going to be able to see FivePoint’s improvement through the transparency and articulation through the public markets. I think that FivePoint’s strategy as it’s been articulated is very focused. There is excellent management team in place. We are happy to number one, be invested in the assets that are -- that make up FivePoint, invested in the management team that makes up FivePoint and we think that giving California’s land constraint, we’re going to have -- we’re going to see tremendous appreciation overtime.
Jon Jaffe: And let me just add the technical part of that question, the difference between the basis on our books and FivePoint books is recognized when there is a third-party sale from FivePoint that difference will be recognized by Lennar.
Jack Micenko: Okay, thank you that's helpful. And then, looking at the backlog the ASP is up about 6% year-over-year, looks like some acceleration there, is that the pricing power you are speaking off or is that WCI mix or maybe a little bit of both?
Stuart Miller : It’s a little bit of both. We are seeing some mix, but we are seeing some price appreciation, the 3% this quarter gave us the confidence as we looked at our backlog the increased average sales price for the rest of the year. So, it’s a little of both.
Jack Micenko: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone.
Stuart Miller : Good morning.
Michael Rehaut : First question, just about sales pace throughout the quarter, if you kind of take the average community count, I know this is kind of in an exact science, but just using methodology consistently, we’ve sales pace up roughly 3% year-over-year that compares to up 5% last quarter.  Just curious if you see anything different in terms of how at least on a year-over-year bases, was that kind of modest improvement, kind of consistent throughout the quarter again a percent here there it is, is not too material. But was there any change as you saw it versus the versus the first quarter, as we kind of focus on the pace year-over-year is kind of getting a better picture of year-over-year demand and change in demand?
Stuart Miller : Jon, want to give prospective there?
Jon Jaffe: Yes I think you saw the traditional spring selling season that strength as you look at year-over-year and the slight uptick in comparison just show that this year was a little bit stronger reflective as our earlier comments seeing in consumer confidence, wage and job growth all reflecting an increased traffic at our welcome home centers, increased convergent rate of that traffic. So all building to a slightly stronger sales pace.
Michael Rehaut : And nothing different that you saw during the quarter?
Jon Jaffe: Pretty consistence, the quarter strengthened from the first month to the second two months, but pretty consistent over the quarter.
Michael Rehaut : Great. And then just secondly on the ASP, I think you kind to talk about 2Q the improvement being a little bit mix and pricing driven and that's what drove your confidence to increase the guidance for the full year. Just want to clarify that increasing in about $5,000 per home. Is that also kind of in some ways both mix and pricing driven and is it right to assume that you are not necessarily increasing your gross margin guidance because you may perhaps that's being offset to the extent that there is a little bit of pricing there, it’s being offset by continued inflation or how should we think about that?
Stuart Miller : There is always a question around mix versus price appreciation when you are rolling up numbers from across the country and it’s very hard to disentangle. I think that there is some offset with construction cost and labor cost and everything else, it’s really hard to get these margin numbers and everything perfectly refined as we look ahead and it moves around through the quarter.  So, it is as you said in your prior question Mike, it’s in exact science and I think we’re all kind of trying to look ahead to what the trend looks like. Generally speaking we’ve seen some initial pricing power, some initial sense of pricing power. But remember that you also have the offset of construction costs and labor costs that are moving in tandem. So we will see how the quarter unfolds, we have given the best guidance that we can at this point. 
Michael Rehaut : Great, thanks so much. 
Stuart Miller : You bet. I think we have time for one more question. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. 
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much for squeezing me in guys. I wanted to follow-up on that, I think earlier in the call when you were addressing pricing, you were talking about the entry level of the market and I thought that I think it was Rick saying that you were able to offset costs with price there sort of suggesting that margins were stable to maybe slightly positive trending. In this context of a mortgage rate environment that’s kind of surprised us over the last six months in terms of coming down fairly meaningfully. I am assuming that probably wasn’t baked into your guidance as well. Are you a little surprised that you haven’t been able to recognize more pricing power at the entry level particularly?
Rick Beckwitt: Well Steve, that’s not exactly what I said, what I was trying to say and let me just backup. We have always articulated that the entry level is a lower margin business given that it’s that type of business. We are continuing to see pricing power in that first time segment, what I was really trying to get to is given the fact that it’s an easier simpler product to build with less Foo Foo [ph] in it if you will, it helps us from a margin standpoint. 
Stuart Miller : We don’t use Foo Foo, well, less specialness on the outside let’s say. 
Stephen Kim: Right. 
Stuart Miller : Just easier to build, faster from the production standpoint. 
Stephen Kim: Okay. 
Stuart Miller : Next question, Steve. 
Stephen Kim: Okay, got it. But within that could you address the interplay of mortgage rates and the obvious impact on affordability and how that affects your pricing dynamic then, in that segment of the market?
Rick Beckwitt:  So I think you are starting to see the buyers in that segment come to the table a little bit better organized, where they have their financing documents enrolled, they have got a little bit higher qualified buyer universe out there. And that’s helping offset some of the pricing increase that we’re able to do, because they have got -- they are just better organized and positioned.
Stuart Miller : Let me add to that and say that, I think, Jon highlighted earlier that a lot of what’s driving people to the market is a sense of confidence, it’s animal spirits, it’s the notion that all of this is in exact science, interest rates and affordability and wages and pricing all play a part and what people can afford and how the math actually works out. But the confidence that people bring with them to the table about whether their job is table and whether there’s going to be a wage increase or there is opportunity for them to move and be mobile to the next job opportunity. Whether they have been to able accumulate a down payment or in excess of a down payment, or whether their family members that are able to help support with the gift or something else, all of these are moving parts that define this in exact science that we are all trying to kind of define going forward. So it’s kind of hard to wrap all of our heads around where the market is going, but the general trajectory is positive and even at the first time buyer level as the millennials start to unwind their doubling up and come to the market realizing that rental rates have gone up and there is a real reason to go ahead and purchase. That first time buyer segment is showing some optimism and some ability to be flexible in and around the affordability levels and as prices move up. I don't know if that's helpful or not Steve, but…
Stephen Kim: Yes that was just what I was getting at. So that's very helpful. The second question I had related to technology and I know you've done a lot of work there and it's come up a few times on this call and it's an area of great interest for us. I think that you had mentioned -- so you called out two areas in particular, I think digital marketing and dynamic pricing. And you said there were some others, but within the digital marketing, I think you've pointed that marketing spend was down year-over-year for 10 straight quarters and in dynamic pricing that you reduced your standing inventory 17% without a negative margin impact. And I guess I was curious as to when you take those two, digital marketing and dynamic pricing, are those the metrics that you're primarily monitoring that you think are the most important for assessing the effectiveness or your programs there? Or is there -- are there other very important metrics that we should be thinking about as it relates to those two. And when you mentioned other initiatives outside of those two, are there any general areas that hold the most promise that you think that we could be focused on?
Stuart Miller : Well, first of all let me say I'm so happy to hear that people are listening to my opening remarks and you did reside back to the -- as you have clearly listened. Look, these initiatives are really core to what we are working on day-to-day inside the company. And your questions are good one, the answer is that those metrics are the starting metrics for those two initiatives, but they are not the only metrics for those two initiatives. There are other embedded metrics that we're working at. So relative to digital marketing, the very first thing was proving that we could improve our traffic particularly the quality of traffic. Put aside the quantity for a minute, but the quality of traffic while reducing the spend. So it was really can we cut the spends by 50 basis points while we improve the quality of the traffic and continue to grow our business. And that was the beginning metric, but as we become more proficient at digital marketing and as we can expand the flow of qualified traffic I highlighted 100,000 customers, qualified customers coming to the doors driven by social media and internet marketing. As we can expand the number coming through the doors, we are probably going to be able to see greater pricing power and other efficiencies as well. And I'm not going to go through and start articulating those matrices, but we think there is more firepower in the digital marketing strategy and we are very focused on that on a regular basis.  Likewise with the dynamic pricing tool, what you're seeing in a reduction in standing inventory is a starter, but the ability to sell homes that are not standing inventory at the end of quarters helps elevate the need to use discounting mechanisms or incentives to move that inventory. And so as we move forwards with those digital tools or technology tools, we think that there is more firepower in them. But we have a whole host of initiatives of that we're working on, that we don't articulate. Because we're simply not getting out over our skies, but we are telling you that we're working on these things every day and we are committed and think we will build a better mousetrap.
Stephen Kim: That's great. Thanks very much for that, appreciated. Good luck. 
Stuart Miller : Okay, you bet. Thanks Steve. And I do want to say thank you everybody for joining us. We look forward to keeping you updated as we move through the rest of 2017. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to Lennar's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to David Collins for their reading of the forward-looking statements. 
David Collins: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements including statements regarding Lennar's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking statements represent only Lennar's estimates on the date of this conference call and are not intended to give any assurance as to actual future results. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect future results and may cause Lennar's actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those described in this morning's press release and our SEC filings, including those under the caption risk factors contained in Lennar's annual report on form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. 
Operator: I'd like to introduce our host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin. 
Stuart Miller: Great, thank you and thanks, David. This morning, I'm out west with Rick Beckwitt, our President; John Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Eric Fader from our Rialto Group. We're going to begin our trade partners summit later tonight. That's why we're out here and this is where we invite many of our manufactures, suppliers and distributors to discuss the homebuilding landscape and to consider better ways to partner and to keep costs and profitability properly aligned.  On the call from Miami we have Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and of course, David Collins, our Controller, who delivered our forward-looking statement; and we also have Jeff Crasnov, CEO of Rialto. I want to apologize in advance if we're a little disjointed as we're going to attempt to coordinate from different locations.  As always, I'm going to start with a brief overview and Bruce will deliver further detail and guidance. As always, after our prepared overview, we will open to Q&A and I'd like to request again that you limit your time to one question, one follow-up so we can enable as many participants as possible within the hour that we've allotted.  So let me go ahead and begin and start by saying that market conditions certainly feel like they are strong and strengthening. The slow and steady, though sometimes erratic, market improvement that we've seen for the entirety of this recovery seems to be giving way to a more definitive reversion to normal.  While our first quarter operating results, particularly gross margins, reflect some of the sluggishness seen at the end of last year, our sales results went from tepid to better to strong as the quarter progressed. Limited supply and production deficits are now intersecting with land and labor shortage and this suggests, though not yet seen, but suggests, that pricing power is on the horizon as we move through the year.  So what are the factors that are driving the change in market sentiment and condition? They're certainly not apparent if you listen to the news stations. As our traffic has increased, we're getting some very direct feedback from our customers as they tell us what they are looking for, their timing and, sometimes, their motivation.  There's clearly a sense of general optimism in the market. There's a perception that jobs are being created and that wages are actually starting to move upward. There's a solidifying sense that the government has adopted a business-friendly posture and that will result in real changes to tax rates and to the regulatory environment.  The banking world is making more overtures to small businesses and to mortgage borrowers and there's a sense that borrowers can make their way through the process. Additionally, the upward direction of interest rates has encouraged some to get off the fence and consider purchasing a home rather than renting. Rents have risen and the prospect of higher purchase prices and higher interest rates makes a compelling case that today's opportunity might be the best opportunity to leave those annual increases in monthly payments behind.  Although there's also a lot of negative noise at the same time, it seems, so far, that the market is looking through the noise and is injecting optimism about the future in its purchase consideration. Additionally, the economic realities of a constrained supply of housing options and the economic realities of rental rates are beginning to have a rational impact on decision-making for the first-time buyer as millennials are coming to market. Interestingly, the front page of U.S.A Today reports today that 60% of millennials ages 18 to 35 are living with parents, relatives and roommates and that is a 115-year high.  Across our platform, each of our business segments benefits from the improvement in the market. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we're expecting that each of our business segments will continue to grow, to mature and to improve and will exceed expectations, particularly in the back half of the year.  Although our first quarter earnings were lower compared to the first quarter of 2016, that is primarily due to a higher tax rate, some one-time WCI closing costs and a fully expected decline in gross margin. While some of the same pressures will exist in the second quarter as well, the acceleration in sales pace against a limited supply and constrained capacity for the market to quickly increase production portends pricing power and a very strong second half of the year.  Against that back drop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating business segments. Our for sale core homebuilding operations are extremely well positioned for a very strong 2017. Our sales were up 11% year-over-year before WCI, 12% including WCI, driven by our strategy of driving better quality traffic through our digital marketing efforts.  Interestingly, our internet leads were up 18% year-over-year to about 100,000 for the quarter. Our social media followers were up 17% year-over-year to 2.8 million on an annual basis and YouTube views were up by 10 million for the year.  Fueled by our digital marketing efforts and other initiatives as well, we continue to focus on operational efficiency as our SG&A is at an historic low for our first quarter. Again, interestingly, our marketing and advertising spend is now down year-over-year for nine consecutive quarters. We continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency and we're improving.  And while we match production with sales pace, we continue to maximize our gross and net margin at 21.1% and 10.8% respectively as we maintain higher sales price in order to maximize returns on our valuable land assets and we manage costs by striving to be the builder of choice to the trades in each of our markets. Our trade partners summit that I mentioned earlier is a big part of that effort.  Though some might be concerned by our lower gross margin, we're exactly where we expected to be in the first part of this year and our year-end margin will still be right on top of our guidance. Of course, we closed on the WCI acquisition in the first quarter and that transaction is going very well. It is being guided by Rick Beckwitt and his team lead by Fred Rothman and Darren McMurray and I've asked Rick to speak specifically to this transaction, so let me turn it over briefly to Rick. 
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. On February 10, 2017, Lennar closed on the acquisition of WCI Communities that was previously announced in September 2016. The purchase price for WCI totaled approximately $643 million which we funded with cash and we also assume $250 million in senior notes. The transaction combined two of the largest home builders in Florida and significantly expands Lennar's product offerings to include luxury, single-family and multi-family homes.  WCI is focused on amenity-rich lifestyle master plan communities catering to the move-up active adult and second home buyers, truly compliments Lennar's leading market position in the entry-level and move-up markets in Florida. During our extensive due diligence period, we identified five main drivers of value creation and synergies. I will go through each of these drivers in a second, but I'm happy to say that the WCI integration has gone very smoothly and that we're ahead of schedule which will lead to a timely realization of this value creation for our shareholders.  The first driver was WCI's portfolio of low-cost land, located in most of the highest growth and largest Florida coastal markets. We acquired over 13,500 home sites, adding 51 actively selling communities and an additional pipeline of future community openings for the next several years. This land portfolio will produce strong gross margins going forward.  The portfolio included many large amenity-rich A plus master plan communities that would be impossible to purchase in today's land constrained market. We have great confidence that we will produce extremely strong returns from these assets as they will be managed by some of the best performing and most profitable positions in our Company.  When we closed the acquisition, we acquired 361 homes in backlog with an average sales price of $516,000, totaling $188 million in near term revenue and cash flow. In addition, at the end of the first quarter, we had 942 WCI homes in various stages of construction.  The second driver was the value maximization of the communities through the reallocation of the WCI and Lennar product and branding. During the due diligence period, we analyzed each community to determine whether we would make higher returns and profits by building WCI product or Lennar product. Approximately 1/3 of the communities that we acquired will be converted to the Lennar brand.  In these communities, Lennar has product that is very similar to WCI and by converting these communities to the Lennar brand, we will significantly lower our build cost with very little, if any, impact on the sales price of the home. We will also significantly increase sales pace and reduce cycle times. These changes will increase both profitability and IRR.  We've also identified several Lennar communities that we will be building WCI product. In these communities, we will be able to achieve much higher sales prices with the WCI brand.  We're also planning to build both WCI and Lennar brands in some of our larger communities to benefit from a dual marketing strategy. This will allow us to increase absorptions and maximize the value of our underlying land positions. This is something we've done very successfully with our higher-priced Village Builders brand in Texas.  The third driver is utilizing our efficient homebuilding operating platform and leveraging our purchasing power. Included in this is streamlining WCIs approach to options.  While we will still offer WCI home buyers a selection of high quality options and upgrades, we will be restructuring their design studio to include a more streamlined selection of options and upgrades. This is similar to what we do in Texas and has allowed us to offer options and upgrades with a more cost effective G&A structure.  Given our leading national and Florida positions, Lennar can purchase materials and labor at a much lower price than WCI. This will not only lower build costs, but provide greater value to the WCI home buyers. Cost savings will also flow from reduced cycle time.  We've been working with our trade partners to re-bid the WCI floor plans and make them more efficient to build. We expect to have this completed by the end of our second quarter. However, you will not see the full benefits of lower cost per square foot until 2018 once all of the acquired inventory and homes under construction are delivered.  Based on our due diligence and work to date, we expect to save between $8 to $12 per square foot or 200 to 300 basis points on new starts once the re-bidding process is completed. And finally, given the strides we've made in digital marketing, we expect lower sales and marketing costs associated with these WCI communities as well.  The fourth driver was the synergies associated with lowering G&A costs. These include the elimination of costs associated with running two public companies as well as headcount reductions associated with overlapping corporate and operating functions. While there will be some upfront costs associated with implementing these changes, we anticipate annualized savings of approximately $30 million beginning in late 2017.  I'm sad to say that Keith Bass, the CEO of WCI, will not be moving forward with Lennar. While I'd hoped that Keith would join us and be a big part of our growth going forward, he has chosen to take some time off and explore some other opportunities. We wish Keith great success going forward and thank him and the entire WCI team for building such an incredible Company.  Finally, the last driver was capturing incremental profits through the rollout of our mortgage and title operations to WCIs homebuilding operations and its Berkshire Hathaway home services operation. This process has begun and we should see a meaningful pickup in activity in financial services as we move into 2018. In conclusion, we're very excited about this acquisition and while we're focused on these five value creation ideas, we're certain that we'll find other areas that will benefit our shareholders.  I'll turn it back over to Stuart. 
Stuart Miller: Great. Thanks, Rick. As you can see, I think we've got our WCI transaction well in hand and we're very enthusiastic about it. So to wrap up homebuilding, I wanted to say we've noted before that our strategy remains a clear pivot in land strategy towards a shorter term land acquisition and towards a 7% to 10% growth strategy. Given the WCI addition, our 2017 growth rates should be on the higher side of our goals or a little over that goal.  We've also refocused on expanding our first-time buyer offering with our mix now standing at right around 40%. Combined, these strategic elements will continue to produce very strong cash flow for the Company and will result in continued balance sheet improvement.  Now let me turn briefly to our other segments. As you've seen, our financial services segment is also off to a great start in 2017. Of course, the business is growing in lock step with our homebuilding operations and will expand with the addition of the WCI acquisition, but it's also expanding its non-Lennar business reach and growing bottom line. Financial services results exceeded last year's first quarter result by 38%, driven in part by increased profitability in title operations and Bruce, who overseas this operation, will give additional color in his portion.  Lennar multi-family. We couldn't be more pleased with the evolution and performance of LMC. Our entry into the apartment development business was timed perfectly and LMC continues to execute flawlessly. LMC, under the leadership of Todd Farrell, has reached maturity and is poised for continuous annual profitability.  As noted in our press release, this segment generated $19.2 million in pretax income, up 57% from last year as we sold another two communities under our merchant build program. During the first quarter, we started some 1,373 apartments in five communities with a total development cost of approximately $600 million.  As of February 28, 2017, we had a geographically diverse pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of almost $8 billion. We're gearing up our build-to-core program that we've discussed in the past with some 20 communities for 6,000 apartments already under construction to fill the $2.2 billion equity bucket with geographically diversified A-located, brand new and modern apartment communities in a generally shelter constrained environment.  Rialto also turned in an excellent quarter. Rialto contributed $12 million to the bottom line this quarter as market conditions favored this business segment as well. The various elements of Rialto are starting to take shape as we continue to work through the remaining legacy assets on book.  In this quarter, we have started to book some of the long awaited promote from fund one which reflects the work of the extraordinary team of professionals investing and managing third-party capital and generating industry-leading returns. Additionally, market conditions particularly favored Rialto Mortgage Finance, as that exceptionally run team which is focused on the commercial mortgage conduit business, exceeded expectations and closed three transactions totaling $478 million. The intersection of an outstanding operating team and strong market conditions produced an industry-leading net margin for the Company.  Finally, FivePoint remains poised as a self-sufficient standalone large-scale community builder in California. This Company manages and controls some of the best positioned properties in some of the most land constrained markets in the country. The current market optimism raises the possibility that this Company, that's been waiting for market conditions to reopen the IPO market, might just find a window to go public. We'll see if the current sweep of optimism in the capital and stock markets sets the stage for FivePoint's future.  So in conclusion, across the platform of our Company, we're feeling pretty optimistic about this year ahead. We're clearly well positioned to capitalize across our platform on the strong market conditions that seem apparent.  Each of our operating segments is mature and positioned to perform in strengthening market conditions. People, assets and operations are all aligned to perform in 2017 and we look forward to keeping you updated.  With that, let me turn it over to Bruce. 
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Revenues from home sales increased 13% in the first quarter, driven by a 13% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a consistent average selling price of $365,000. WCI had a minimal impact to revenues in the first quarter as there were only 51 deliveries from the acquisition date until the end of the quarter.  Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 21.1% and as Stuart mentioned, we're still on track with our previously stated gross margin goal of 22% to 22.5% for the full year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land and construction costs. Our gross margin percentage was impacted 10 basis points due to the write-off of WCI backlog inventory that closed during the first quarter.  Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, but it improved sequentially from our fourth quarter total of 6.2%. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in our homebuilding east segment. Direct construction costs were up 4% year-over-year to approximately $55 per square foot and that was driven by approximately a 6% increase in labor and 3% in material costs.  SG&A percentage, as a percent of home sale revenue in the first quarter, was 10.3%. We're continuing to improve SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and benefiting from the focus on technology investments that Stuart mentioned. Included in the SG&A in the first quarter were one-time expenses related to the WCI acquisition, mainly offset by one-time legal and insurance benefits resulting in a net one-time charge of approximately $2.7 million or 10 basis points impact to SG&A percent during the quarter.  Other income was $5.7 million compared to other expense of $600,000 in the same period last year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $11.5 million which included our share of net operating losses from JVs as they incurred G&A costs while ramping up for our future land sales.  During the quarter, we opened 58 new communities and added 51 net communities from the WCI acquisition to end the quarter with 752 net active communities. New homeowners increased 12% and new order dollar value increased 16% for the quarter. WCI had a minimal impact to this number, as they were only 70 new home orders from this acquisition since we only had a couple of weeks in that first quarter post acquisition.  Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at three sales per community per month versus 2.9 and that improved sequentially throughout the quarter. The cancellation rate was 16%. In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 home sites, totaling $659 million and just to note, the first quarter usually has the largest dollar amount of land purchases for the year.  Including the home sites from the WCI acquisition, our home sites owned and controlled now total 173,000 home sites, of which 137,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We now have approximately 4.6 years' supply of land owned based on this year's projected deliveries. We expect the year of supply of land to continue to decline as we continue with our soft pivot land strategy. Our completed unsold homes at the end of the quarter were in our normal range of one to two per community, totaling 1,342 homes.  Turning to financial services, this segment had strong results with operating earnings of $20.7 million compared to $14.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased slightly to $13.4 million from $13 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by higher volume. Mortgage originations increased to $1.8 billion versus $1.7 billion in the prior year and the capture rate of Lennar home buyers was 81% compared to 82% in the prior year.  Our title companies profit increased to $6.8 million during the quarter from $2 million in the prior year and this was driven by a 15% increase in revenue during the quarter and the associated overhead leverage from this higher volume.  Turning to the Rialto segment and providing more details, the operating earnings were $12 million compared to $1.9 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The Investment Management business contributed $34.4 million of earnings, primarily due to $33.4 million of management fees and other and this included $10 million of carried interest received in the quarter relating to Fund One.  At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate funds one and two now totals approximately $125 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $478 million of commercial loans into three securitizations, resulting in earnings of $33.2 million compared to $380 million and $3.9 million in the prior year respectively and these are both before their G&A expenses.  The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in volume and average net margins of the securitizations from 1.6% in the prior year to 7.1% in the first quarter. Our direct investments had a loss of $15.9 million during the quarter as we continued to work towards monetizing the remaining assets purchased from early portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $33.3 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $6.4 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $163 million of cash.  Turning to the multi-family segment, I'll just add a couple of comments to what Stuart mentioned. The $19.2 million of operating profit in the quarter was driven by the segment's $26 million share of gains from the sale of two operating properties as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 34%. The rate is higher than the prior year's rate of 28.1% because the prior year had one-time adjustments due to an IRS settlement and energy credits. We expect the tax rate to be 34% approximately for the remainder of 2017.  Turning to the balance sheet which remains strong, we had a net debt to total capital of 41.6% which was an improvement of 370 basis points over the prior year. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with over $640 million of cash and only $250 million of borrowings on our $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility. Additionally, we grew stockholders' equity by 24% year-over-year to $7.2 billion and our book value per share grew to $30.70 per share.  The preliminary goodwill estimate from the WCI acquisition is $150 million to $175 million and that's subject to revision as it is still being reviewed, both internally and externally. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of 4 1/8% senior notes due 2022 and we added $250 million of 6 7/8% senior notes due 2021 as part of the WCI acquisition which we're likely to refinance at the next call date in August.  Finally, I would like to update our goals for 2017. Some of you already included WCI in your estimates for 2017 and all of the numbers that I'll be providing here include the full impact of the WCI acquisition which will be accretive in 2017.  Starting with deliveries, we're increasing our delivery goal to between 29,500 and 30,000 homes for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 75% to 80% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We're still expecting an average sales price between $365,000 and $370,000 for the full year and we're right on track with our operating margins of around 13% for the full year.  There will be an impact to our second quarter gross margin from writing up WCI's backlog in purchase accounting. As a result, we expect our second quarter gross margin percentage to be between 21% and 21.5%, while the full-year gross margin is still expected, as I mentioned, to be 22% to 22.5%.  We still expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to between 9.1% to 9.3% for the full year. The second quarter will have some non-recurring transition costs relating to the WCI integration, therefore, we expect SG&A to be approximately 9.5% in Q2. The operating leverage will be in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters.  Financial services, we're increasing the goal to approximately $160 million for the year with the second quarter expected to be approximately $40 million. The increase is due to the partial-year inclusion of the Berkshire Hathaway Realty Services brokerage operation from the WCI acquisition as well as additional closings from the WCI deal. We're adding WCI to our mortgage platform, although keep in mind, 50% of the WCI buyers use all cash and we will focus on capturing a high percentage of the other 50% that require a mortgage.  Rialto is still expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year, with the second quarter expected to be approximately $5 million. Multi-family is still expected to be between $70 million and $80 million for the full year, the second quarter is expected to be also approximately $5 million which includes one apartment community sale.  The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income is still expected to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million of profit for the year. However, the second quarter is expected to have net expenses of $15 million to $20 million, while the second half of 2017 is driving all the profit for this category.  Corporate G&A is still expected to be 2.2% to 2.3% and our net community count is expected to end the year between 770 and 780 communities. And last, our balance sheet, we still continue to expect a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we accomplished in the prior year. With these updated goals in mind, we're well positioned for the remainder of 2017.  And with that, let me turn it back to the Operator to open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now open. 
Carl Reichardt: Stuart, I wanted to ask about your comment related to pricing power. First of all, does the overall guidance for the year assume that you'll be able to push those prices? Is that largely on the low end where you think you might be able to do that and in the context of the potential for higher rates, flattening rents, certainly plenty of competition from peers, what gives you confidence that you may have that ability? 
Stuart Miller: Interesting. Carl, our guidance is really tied to the current state, the current market environment, the way that we see things right now. The discussion, the statements that I made on the conference call, on the, my prepared comments and in our quote, really are kind of forward-looking given the temperament of the market right now and kind of what we see around the corner or what we feel like we're seeing around the corner.  I don't want to get too far out over our skis. We're not injecting that optimism in our guidance right now, but what we're seeing and what we've heard a lot about, is supply constraint across all kinds, all dwelling product types from rental to for sale and we have also seen that we're land constrained and production constrained and that's been the case for some time.  The injection of some market optimism and what we saw in our sales pace as we went through the quarter really gives me reason to believe that as we look out ahead a couple of quarters, we're going to start to see prices move just as we would expect with a demand and supply imbalance, with demand increasing and supply somewhat constrained. So that's kind of where we're on that. Our guidance was really rooted in where we've seen things on more current basis. 
Carl Reichardt: And my follow-up is you made a comment about banks making more overtures to borrowers. And I wonder if you could flesh that out in terms of mortgage lending, particularly to first-time customers and then also, in terms of community banks or I guess even money center banks, financing developers and the potential that you could start to see some more opportunities to option finish lots, since that's been, something that's been lacking for awhile. Thanks, Stuart. 
Stuart Miller: Yes, sure. So my comments about banks is more narrative that we're hearing from the banks than actual action in the field at this point. The banks are definitely starting to talk about the regulatory environment shifting and the enforcement environment shifting and reverting to a more normal state.  The banks are starting to talk about their ability to think about getting back into the mortgage market and lending to smaller businesses which I think is sorely needed and these things will all ripple through the housing market in a positive way. Let's go on to the next question. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner. Your line is now open. 
Alan Ratner: My questions relate to the cost side and, Stuart, maybe since you're on the verge of meeting with a bunch of your trades, hopefully, you'll get more insights here. But, if you look out in California, there's been some pretty wet weather there and I know there's some concern that we might see something similar to what happened in 2015 as an industry when I think Texas in particular felt some pretty significant headwinds from a wet Spring. As the year went on, I think a lot of builders struggled to get homes closed and costs went up. And you guys obviously navigated that very well, but it certainly does create risk from the industry is concerned as far as costs going up.  So, A, I'm curious what you're hearing there as far as the general availability of labor and the industry's ability to deal with some of those weather headwinds. And second question, just about California specifically, there's some news about a proposed bill out there that would potentially raise construction costs quite a bit, with the prevailing wage requirement in communities there. So, I was curious if you looked at that at all, what impact that might have, given your pretty significant land position in California and how you would handicap the likelihood of that passing at this point. Thank you. 
Stuart Miller: Okay so, wow, that's a real fist full of questions. Let's start with the California question and let's remember that there are always legislative moves afoot to alter the landscape in California. The legislation that's proposed at this point is just another one of those that comes down the pike on a pretty regular basis and we'll just have to see where it works out.  It's a bill that, if implemented as it's described, would have an impact on costs relative to residential construction. Some communities out there, including some of our larger scale communities in FivePoint, might be exempt from the legislation, so it would be a mixed bag of impacts, some of them positive, some of them negative. I think, overall, negative for affordability in California and so this is going to be talked through, worked out and see where we actually end up.  But this is the landscape in California and I think that all of these type of legislative initiatives come with positive and negative impacts and we'll just have to see where this one shakes out. As it relates to construction costs overall, the story around construction costs has been one of increases over the past many quarters. You've heard us talk about that.  I think that as we think about our numbers, construction costs as a percentage of our sales price has probably moved up around 100 basis points and there's most certainly pressure on construction costs in the labor constrained market and this is why we focus on our trade partner Summit, our relationship with our trade partners, making sure that we're the builder of choice for our trade partners.  We think that this is a strategic advantage for the Company and we've spent a lot of time developing relationships throughout our trade. So let me just turn it over to Jon and ask him because Jon really spear-headed this effort within the Company and has done a remarkable job. 
Jon Jaffe: So, clearly, the pressures remain from a labor constrained market. What we see a little bit different is we have seen some pressure on the material side. Lumber, for example, is up about 9% since December and we've seen an impact there and even with all of the commodities, they all have moved up. In part, in reaction to expected expenditures by the government with infrastructure and that's affecting the supply chain. But as Stuart mentioned, our focus is that those cost pressures are going to be what they are.  And we position ourselves to how we take advantage of the marketplace of what our landscapes in front of us and I think we have excellent communication relationships with our trade to make sure we're well positioned. There will be a spike of activity once the weather dries up in California, as you know and we're in deep discussions with all our trades about how to manage that as it comes out and I think we'll navigate those waters very well. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. 
Stephen Kim: Stuart, I wanted to ask or maybe Rick could also chime in here, I guess, on the community count guide. It was a little lower than what we had been thinking initially and, I guess, obviously, demand has been better than expected than we might have thought.  And so, we're trying to figure out whether or not this means that you're going to be selling out of communities a little quicker or if it means, on the other hand, that in response to the strong demand, you're going to actually open up more communities to the greatest of your ability. And so how that all nets out. We're curious as to whether or not you think that you're going to be able to accelerate community openings as you get maybe into the back half a little bit more than what you, than what your guidance would seem to suggest.  Are you just being conservative in that regard or do you think the cost demand is going to be good? Just going to sell out of stuff a little quicker and so maybe it's not until 2018 that we see an improvement in -- an additional step up in community count. 
Rick Beckwitt: So, Steve, this is Rick. I think you really nailed it. It's a combination of some acceleration of absorptions in some really well located communities. That combined with weather impacts that have delayed some of our communities opening and there's also a portion of it where we buy home sites from third party developers and we can't control the schedule that they deliver the home sites to us. I think as we approach the back half of the year, you'll start to see an acceleration of community count. Clearly into 2018, we'll be on a pretty good run rate at that point. 
Stuart Miller: Steve, let me just chime in and say that community count is Rick's least favorite number. 
Stephen Kim: Yes, likewise. 
Stuart Miller: It is the one number that is like three-dimensional chess trying to figure it out there. A lot of moving parts as you go through the year. There's some prediction, anticipation, some guesswork and it's because, as demand moves around a little bit, as weather impacts, as third party participants, as we have moderated down our ownership of land, we're more dependent on third party. All of these places play a part in making it a hard number to get your head around and so we do conservatize it a little bit as well. 
Stephen Kim: Sure, well good news is you always have price which you can use to modulate things too, so that's good. My second question relates to tax rates and I know that tax policy is certainly a very nebulous issue right now. However, it doesn't stop people from running some hypotheticals and I imagine your Company is no different.  So, obviously, if the corporate tax rate were to drop, that will be fairly straightforward. However, in the case of builders, there's at least three things that seem to be coming up in conversations with investors that could be offset. I was curious if you might be able to opine on in general sense of order of magnitude how this all may come out in the wash, those other three components being the reduction of interest deductibility, energy tax credits and perhaps the manufacture's deduction and maybe I'm missing something else. But, could you give us a sense for what the relative order of magnitude is in terms of the size of the significance of these three pieces to your tax rate? 
Stuart Miller: Well, you're right, we've definitely looked and we're looking at each of the component parts. I will say that I've had a recent opportunity to listen to Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, who seems to be in a lead position there. And the two things that I take away from listening to him is that he's very smart, very thoughtful in his approach and I frankly derived a lot of confidence listening to him walk through the thinking.  The other thing that I walked away with is a sense that he and this administration are listening carefully knowing that there will be winners and losers, there will be ups and downs, in any configuration of the tax revamp and so there is, virtually, no ability to draw certainty today from what pieces and in what proportion they are going to be woven into a new tax program. So with that, Bruce, why don't you take a swipe at giving some relative proportion to the various pieces? 
Bruce Gross: Sure. If you look at our current tax rate of 34%, the question is going to be whether it goes down -- what rate it goes down to, but for the three items you mentioned, Steve. Energy credits which we do have some, we have the manufacturing credit and the interest deduction, corporate interest deduction. Those three, based on our current numbers, are approximately 5%, give or take, so that would take the 34% rate down to about 29% or so.  I'm sorry. There would be about 5% in total from those of a reduction from the 34% and I need to just add one more component. If the tax rate went down to 20%, that's where we'd get down to about a 5% reduction of call it 29%. If the tax rate was maybe coming down to 25%, in conjunction with that, then it would be pretty much a push and there wouldn't be any positive impact. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen East. Your line is now open. From Wells Fargo. 
Stephen East: Stuart, you gave a ton of information, so I'll try to keep my compound questions to a minimum here, but on the order growth side of it, obviously, you're seeing a lot of acceleration as you go through. You talked about a bit. Can you give us a bit more color about what's going on, where you're seeing it more? It sounded like entry level was a big part of it and yet at the same time, your incentives have moved up and your growth rate was above your targeted rate. So I'm just trying to reconcile the incentives versus what you all are seeing on the ground and how you want to manage that demand as you move through the year. 
Jon Jaffe: Hello, Steve. You really see the absorption pace moderate by market. So, for example, California and the Pacific Northwest are strongest from a pace. California is up 4.5 sales per community. I think that our Company average is three. So, in those markets, you see that incentives, you see more pricing power. And in other markets, the Tampa and Orlando, we saw healthy pace there of 3.7 sales per community.  Even in Houston we saw an improvement as we reduced our community count, but our sales pace picked up a little bit year-over-year. So, in those markets, I'd say that it affects both the starter price point and the move-up price points. In Texas which is marked as more flattish from a sales pace standpoint, there you see a differential where the first time buyer product moves at a faster pace than the move-up product. 
Stephen East: Okay and from an incentive perspective, I assume as you go through the year, we would expect to see that come down. Is that a fair expectation? 
Jon Jaffe: Yes, that's what we expect. We're setting out in the winter months, December, January, we saw more incentives. We've seen that come down and we would expect to see that continue to come down. 
Stephen East: Okay. And then, on the gross margin, you all are comfortable with it moving back up to full year, staying within your range and yet, it surprised us below what we were expecting. I guess a couple of things, given that you've got a lot of cost flowing through lumber, et cetera, labor, land, what gives you the comfort there that you're going to be able to, one, not only cover that cost, but make it up quite a bit? And then how much in purchase accounting is embedded for WCI in that 20% to 22.5%? 
Stuart Miller: Let me start and then have Rick and Jon weigh in, but as I said in my opening remarks, some of what you saw in our gross margin reflects some of the sluggishness that we saw towards the end of last year. Remember that what we're selling two quarters ago, we're closing now and as we went through the election season, as we went through some reconciliations in November, the market was a little bit slower than reported and we saw that bleed into December.  We went from kind of sluggish, to better, to strong -- in terms of sales. So as you see things firm up, there's a little bit less incentives and a little bit more price. Construction costs have been moving up at the same pace. We feel pretty comfortable as we look at our numbers, as we look at our backlog right now, that our margin is coming back up. Rick? 
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I guess the thing I'd say to add to that, Stephen, is we're spot on with where we thought we would be for the quarter with regard to gross margins. 
Stephen East: Okay. 
Rick Beckwitt: I think that the analyst community put too much margin in the first half of the year than in the back half of the year. We're on the trajectory to get to where we guided to. With regard to WCI, as Bruce said, it'll have about a 20 to 30 basis point impact in Q2. But given the fact that WCI had a low cost land position with high gross margins, it will not negatively impact margins for this year on an annualized basis. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now open. 
John Lovallo: First question would be the year-over-year decline in backlog conversion in the west. How much of that was due to weather and can you quantify potentially the impact on ASP and on potentially gross margin? 
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. For the most part, it was due to the weather. More impacted in terms of starts than the closings, but there were markets where it was impact as well. We couldn't complete landscaping which prevented us from getting COOs, as an example.  I think that we will make up the majority of that. It will push towards the back of the year and a little of it will slide into where multi-family type of for-sale product in the Bay Area, as an example. There's condominiums. That might push out beyond the year. But I don't think that we'll see any impact to our margins from those weather impacts and delays, just some timing issues. 
John Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful. And then, in the central division, it looks like orders were actually down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Can you maybe give us a little color around that? 
Stuart Miller: I think some of that is driven by the impact of still, a little bit of sluggishness in Houston, but with regard to Houston, we have seen a pick up. We're starting to see a little of an increase in rig count and we still have a divergence in sales pace between the higher priced and the lower priced ones. So, Houston was a little soft, but it looks like it's, the picture is getting a little brighter there as we move through the year. 
Jon Jaffe: As we look at that -- this is Jon -- we strategically reduced our community count in Houston which brought the total community count in the central region down a little bit year-over-year and our sales pace was actually just up a tick year-over-year, so I think it's pretty steady there and we're managing our portfolio of communities adjusting it to the market conditions. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
Michael Rehaut: First question I just had, Stuart, I wanted to go back to some of your opening remarks about sales pace being better than expected and referring to some optimism in the marketplace and you mentioned that the sales pace, when we look about sales pace, excuse me, we calculate if you strip out WCI, that sales pace was up about 7% year-over-year.  That's versus roughly 5%, 5.5% in 4Q, 5% in 3Q. So, definitely a touch better, but I was interested, if the sales pace increased materially throughout the quarter, during the quarter. Obviously, you also have your typical spring selling season pick up. But on a year-over-year basis, if the sales pace increased materially or, given that 7% is a little better than 5%, just wanted to know if there's any other kind of metrics that is driving that commentary. 
Stuart Miller: Okay, so, I'm not really sure where you get your 7%, but let's put that aside and let's understand where my commentary comes from. Remember that when we're looking at our monthly year-over-year, we're looking at comparison to last year. So, let's take seasonality out of the equation because we're looking at December to December, January to January, February to February, so the seasonality is injected at both sides.  And what we were seeing in terms of the numbers is a slower and lower comparison in December, a comparable comparison in January and a substantially higher comparison in February. So that's the numerical side of the commentary. But the empirical side is what I look to dovetail with the number side, as I think about these things and I try to think about them in realtime and balance what we're hearing at the front line in the field from our customers and measure that up against what we're seeing in the numbers.  And so the commentary really derives from the kind of traffic patterns, the questions that people are talking about and the kinds of people that are showing up. What we're starting to see -- I think in my commentary I noted that the millennials are doubled up at about a 60% rate living at home with parents, relatives or roommates. It's at 115 year high as reported in U.S.A Today.  I don't know if that's exactly the right number, but it is directionally interesting and we're starting to see some of that cohort start to come out to our sale centers and talk about the fact that rental rates are high, rental rates have been moving, rental rates create some instability. It's time to start thinking about buying a home, 30-year mortgage, fixing the monthly payment and looking at the possibilities and benefits of actual ownership, dovetailing that with the banks talking about coming back to market.  These are the components that kind of make up my sense that there's something afoot in the market that's broader than just one month in a row positive comparison. So that's kind of where it comes from, Mike. 
Michael Rehaut: That's perfect. And yes, definitely thinking about it in terms of year-over-year, so appreciate that. I guess, secondly, just on WCI and obviously, congrats on the closing of that transaction and it looks like you're going to extract a lot of value there. I was interested, you mentioned that there's a low cost basis there and attractive margins.  At the same time, you're going to have the typical purchase accounting impact on 2Q, but once you work through that, from my understanding, purchase accounting typically does impact what's the overall lot position as well and I was just curious to get a sense maybe, Bruce, if you want to throw out some -- opine here or talk about what's been able to be worked through or worked out from an accounting perspective?  How should we think about the gross margins from WCI because, typically, from my understanding, those are written up as well. I don't know if there was different nuances or idiosyncrasies with this particular acquisition. 
Stuart Miller: Well, what I would say, Mike, is that, as we go through the purchases accounting exercise, we look at all the various assets and the assets will be, let's just to use an estimate, be somewhere close to the margins that we get within that marketplace where the assets are. So as we're performing at a certain level, we would expect the assets in that same market to be somewhere close.  So, the real purchase accounting impact is really in the second quarter as we write up backlog and then as you get beyond the second quarter, for the most part, the integration costs, the write up of backlog is all behind us, we expect. And then for the second half of the year and beyond, you get back to more normal type of margins that we would expect in that market place and that's probably the best way to think about it. 
Michael Rehaut: Are margins in your home Florida market above corporate average? 
Stuart Miller: They are just a little bit ahead of the Company average. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now open. 
Jade Rahmani: You mentioned WCI should be accretive for the full year 2017, primarily in the second half, so wanted to see if you could provide any commentary, a bit high level, regarding 2018. Should the main areas of potential further improvement from that acquisition come through the SG&A leverage and financial services? 
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, this is Rick. We haven't really given any 2018 guidance, but you could expect from my comments earlier that we will get SG&A leverage, you will see a benefit to some gross margin because of lower costs and operating efficiencies and as we move into the tail end of this year, we'll give guidance for 2018. 
Jade Rahmani: And on the financial services side, can you just provide further color on what drove the uptick in title? Any changes into how you're marketing the product or any additional services you're offering home buyers? 
Bruce Gross: I could take that. We have a little static in the background, but, Jade, titles, first quarter is typically the lowest quarter of the year, so that increase is on a very low base and, essentially, we just had some additional pricing in terms of the average sales price of the transactions we had during the quarter were higher on the same overhead base, so we got additional leverage. So, percentage wise, it looked really good, but nominally, it was really just a small increase. 
Stuart Miller: Okay, so with that, let me say thank you to everybody for joining us. We feel really good about how our Company is positioned and how the year is starting to shape up. We think that the overall environment is strong and we look forward to reporting back to you as we go through the rest of the year. Thank you. 
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Thank you and thank you, David. This morning I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from, Diane Bessette our Vice President and Treasurer, Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto are all here with us, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer is with us by phone from California and some of that group will be joining in our conversations during the Q&A period. I am going to briefly give some remarks as I always do and Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year as we always do at this time of year and then we'll open up to Q&A.As always, I'd like to request one question and one follow-up, so we can have as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin. Our fourth quarter and year-end results reflect our disciplined adherence to our company-wide strategies of managing our business to a clearly defined growth rate in order to run our business efficiently, while generating cash flow in order to fortify our balance sheet. We grew our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings by 11% and 14% respectively, while we improved our balance sheet to a 33.4% homebuilding net debt to total cap ratio, which is now back to our pre-downturn financial condition. We view that as quite an accomplishment. Across our platform in each of our business segments, we improved performance and operations to position for the future and to make the overall company stronger. As we arrive at the close of 2016, we are better able to achieve our overall goal of reverting to a pure-play homebuilder with an excellent operating platform and a healthy capital structure that enables us to be both opportunistic and to ultimately return capital to shareholders in the future. All of this was accomplished in the context of market conditions that were suboptimal in 2016, defined by overall slow, but directionally steady market improvement that was often choppy and sometimes complicated. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a generally similar economic environment to find the homebuilding landscape with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. Our company strategies of soft pivot on land, 7% to 10% growth target and improved cash flow will remain the same for now and we expect to achieve similar growth and balance sheet improvements in 2017 as Bruce will detail in our guidance for the next year. These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward momentum movement in interest rates mapped out by the Fed and the many questions around taxes in the regulatory environment raised by our incoming potentially business friendly new President, we expect to see continued slow but steady market improvement that can be choppy and erratic at times as the new administration goes to the throes of enacting the agenda of change, upside exist to this view if a general sense of optimism continues to dominate and changes happen quicker, we'll have to wait and see. We continue to believe though that production levels in the $1 million to $1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. The rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years should continue to drive overall growth in the housing market. Therefore we see the current levels of production forming somewhat of a downside or floor to the market. Even with interest rates moving higher, the first time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market undeterred by the marginally higher monthly payment, especially in the context of continued rent increases. Lower unemployment, wage growth and general consumer confidence should drive household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartment. We believe that there continues to be strong pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than in others and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rates. This goes for both the first time and the move up purchasers. While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, we feel that any relaxing of the hyper regulated baking system will normalize the mortgage market, which should enable more purchasers to find their way to home ownership. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to the market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing start ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady though positive homebuilding market that will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These had been our consistent guiding views over the past year and we've mapped our operating strategy around these views through at this point we leave room for upside as we look ahead. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2017 and beyond and we believe -- and we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of our business segments going forward. Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale core homebuilding operations have operated a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence throughout 2016. As we've noted in past conference calls, we've adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive on the retail side. We've noted three key components of our core homebuilding strategy. Number one, soft pivot on land purchases; number two, lower targeting growth rate and number three, heavy focus on SG&A. We've continued to reduce our combined land and land development spend and new orders in the fourth quarter and the full year grew at 9% while the year -- while deliveries for the year were also up 9%. This is right on top of our targeted growth rate and has enabled us to focus on reducing SG&A while driving cash flow. We've reduced our SG&A throughout the year even while continued labor shortages, construction cost increases and land increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins and focused on SG&A in the fourth quarter to bring it to an 8.7% rate to offset pressure on gross margins and maintain a strong net margin, which came in at 14.6% for the quarter. This was accomplished while we've also been increasing our spend on companywide technologies in order to realize additional reductions in the future. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to continue to focus on these three pillars of our operating strategy in order to drive performance. Our first of those pillars, we continue our soft pivot on land strategy as we are targeting high-quality A location -- A location land acquisition with a shorter two to three year average life. Additionally, we're focused on expanding our first time homebuyer offering organically with lower land cost as that segment of the market has continued to recover. And finally, we've used the opportunistic, proposed purchase of WCI to fill in some blanks and partially offset land purchases, upgrading our land positions with already mature communities. Second, we've noticed -- noted in past quarterly conference calls given the now mature recovery that we will continue to manage our growth in order to concurrently grow the bottom line and drive strong cash flows. We continue to manage the growth target -- our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. In the third prong with less pressure on top line growth rate, we've intensified management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra, as I said last quarter of what we can measure, we can change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operating platform. I noted the example in past quarters that we've been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiative. We've expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expensive -- in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 8.7% is the lowest fourth quarter SG&A in our company's history and allow -- and that follows last quarter's lowest third quarter SG&A. Our homebuilding operations are truly becoming extremely efficient operating machine with demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for homebuilding -- for our homebuilding segment, positions us well for steady growth as well as the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically. Moving on, our financial services group has also had an outstanding year of accomplishment in 2016. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic refi market as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. While we expect refi opportunities to diminish as rates rise, the other sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we move through 2016 and that's reflected in our fourth quarter earnings of $51.4 million versus $33.8 last year. Our strategy for 2017 for financial services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. Next our multifamily program LMC Lennar Multifamily Communities, really matured in 2016 into a leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. LMC had an incredible quarter in our fourth quarter. Earnings totaled $41.4 million up 306% from the $10.2 million in 2015. During the fourth quarter, we sold four of our merchant build apartment communities all with high IRRs and twp plus multiples. During the fourth quarter, we started 1,155 apartment homes in five communities with a total development cost of approximately $469 million. As of November 30, 2016, we have -- we had a geographically diversified pipeline of 74 communities, totaling almost 23,000 apartment homes with a total development cost of approximately $7.7 billion. Also during the fourth quarter, we had the final close of our now $2.2 billion Lennar Multifamily Venture, LMV -- we call LMV. LMV represents the largest equity capital raise ever completed in the multifamily industry and demonstrates the confidence venture investors have place in LMC and our new build-to-core strategy that will allow us to maintain an ownership interest in a portfolio of income producing communities going forward. We continue to see growing demand in housing, both in our core homebuilding business as well as our multifamily platform and this venture is a key building block for one of our growing ancillary businesses. Next our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the back half of 2016 as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of the year. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve, particularly for RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance, which has maintained its position as one of the largest non-bank CMBS originators. RMF completed its 32nd through 31st securitization transaction during the quarter selling over $622 million of RMF originated loans with very healthy net margins. This brings our total to over $6.5 billion of securitized loans since RMF's inception. On the investment management front, we also previously announced first quarter closings of commitments for our third fund. This fund will complement our other opportunistic funds with readily available capital to invest. Our first two flagship opportunity funds have continued to be top quartile producers. Fund one as an example became fully invested in early 2013 and we've now distributed the 141% of investor's original capital from income and monetization and with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto has now realized two times its original investment with a lot more to go. Fund two made its final investment during the first quarter, investing including recycling over $1.6 billion of equity in 100 transactions and similar to fund one, we've been making distributions already returning about 36% of investor's original commitments. Rialto's investment in asset management platform had been growing its asset base as well as harvesting value for investors and us. In a little over six years, we've now raised almost $7 billion of equity in a variety of real estate funds and investment vehicle we've invested about $6.1 billion of equity and we've already returned $4.8 billion to investors who have earned in excess -- who have earned almost $2.4 billion over the years. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and as we look ahead to 2017, Rialto earnings will continue to grow as we work through our remaining legacy assets and refine our businesses into a two-pronged capital-light segment focused solely on RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance and the investment management business as well. Finally FivePoint is now a self-sufficient standalone company that’s a premier strategic large scale community builder in California. In 2016, we successfully contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings LLC. This transaction liberated FivePoint in 2016 to start acting independently to raise capital and to use its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. It also positioned FivePoint to take advantage of either a recovered IPO market should that happen for other opportunities as they arise. We simply could not be more excited about the long-term prospects for this one of a kind leader in community development. So overall and in conclusion let me say 2016 was a great strategic year for the company and it sets up another year of consistent performance and opportunity. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that we've successfully implemented in our business have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth in 2017 and beyond. So now let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks Stuart and good morning. I'll provide some additional color on our 11% earnings increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by an 8% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $357,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the fourth quarter was 23.3%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 24.6%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs and construction costs. Sales incentives were 6.2% this quarter compared to 5.9% in the prior year. The slight increase was primarily due to our focus on reducing completed unsold homes, which we managed to decreased by 13% year-over-year to 975 homes. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East region and our direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 3% year-over-year to approximately $54 per square foot and this was driven entirely by the labor side, which was offset just slightly by a small decrease in material costs. Our SG&A percentage improved 50 basis points as Stuart mentioned to 8.7% in the fourth quarter. About 30 basis points of that improvement was attributable to operating leverage from growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and the other 20 basis points was due to improvement and advertising costs, which we reduced as a result of our focus on digital marketing. Gross profits on land sales during the quarter were $24.3 million was primarily driven by 3 million transactions during the quarter versus 7.9 million in the prior year. Equity and loss from unconsolidated entities was $24.6 million, which included our share of net operating losses from the newly created FivePoint entity. We opened 66 new communities during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 695 active communities. New home orders -- new home orders increased 9% and the new order dollar value increased 12% for the quarter. Our sales pace was higher during the quarter to 3.2 sales per community, per month, versus 3.0 in the prior year and the cancellation rate was 18%. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 4,500 home sites, totaling $259 and this is the same dollar amount that we purchased in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with what Stuart highlighted about our soft pivot strategy, where we're focused on buying shorter duration land while continuing to grow the company. The number of years of land owned has now been reduced to 4.8 years. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 159,000 home sites of which 33,000 are controlled. Our financial services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $51.4 million compared to $33.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.6 million from $25.9 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment and higher volumes. Mortgage originations increased to $2.7 million compared to $2.4 billion in the prior-year and we captured 81% of Lennar homebuyers. As a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the fourth quarter, we achieved a 72% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. Refinance volume was 15% of the total origination volume, but the strong refinance market also drove higher margins per loan. Our title company's profit increased to $14.9 million in the quarter from $8 million in the prior year and this was primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume and the focus on operational efficiencies. Providing a little bit more color on Rialto segment, the produced operating earnings of $8 million compared to $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The investment management business contributed $33.1 million of earnings, which included $4.6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $28.5 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate funds one and two, now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $622 million of commercial loans into four securitization resulting in earnings of $35.6 million compared with $854 million and $15.8 million in the prior year respectively, before their G&A expenses. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in average net margins of the securitizations from 2.2% in the prior year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter. The direct investments in Rialto had a loss of $10.7 million in the quarter and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $43.3 million for the quarter and interest expense excluding the warehouse lines was $6.7 million. Rialto also ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $149 million of cash. Adding to Stuart's comments on multifamily, the $41.4 million operating profit in the quarter was driven primarily by the segment's $47.2 million share gains from the sale of four operating properties as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with five completed and operating properties and 38 under construction, 13 of which are in lease up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.4 billion, so you could see the pipelines for the sales that we're going to talk about for 2017. Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%. The rate is lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the tax department's continuing efforts to maximize new home energy efficiency credit, which is currently set to expire at the end of 2016. As a result of the expiration of this credit, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 34%. Turning to the balance sheet, the matching of the operating strategies with our execution has returned our balance sheet to the very healthy levels that existed before the downturn. We highlighted that the soft pivot strategy, strong profitability and the conversion of our converts will drive the path to lower leverage. The result was an 880 basis point decline in net debt to total cap, going from 42.2% at the end of the prior year to 33.4% at this year end. This year we generated between $400 million and $500 million of operating cash flow in 2016. Our liquidity strength provides exceptional financial flexibility with now over $1 billion of cash and no borrowings on our $1.8 billion revolving credit facility. Our balance sheet is rock solid and its positioning us well for tomorrow's opportunities. Additionally, stockholders equity now exceeds $7 billion and our book value per share increased to $29.96 per share. During the quarter, we converted the remaining $157 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. Next step for the balance sheet will be continued focus on cash flow generation and retiring the $400 million of 12.25% debt on June 1, which currently cost us approximately $50 million of interest per year. Now I would like to provide some goals for 2017. Please note these goals exclude the benefit from the WCI acquisition, which we will update in our first quarter conference call assuming the transaction closes as expected in our first quarter. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to our fiscal 2017 numbers, excluding transaction costs. Number one deliveries, we are currently geared up to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 deliveries for 2017. We expect the backlog conversion ratio to be approximately 70% for the first quarter, between 80% and 85% for the second and third quarters and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We are expecting an average sales price between 365,000 and 370,000 for the full year. We expect operating margins to be around 13% for the full year. The full year gross margin is expected to be in the range of 22% to 22.5%. We expect continuing improvement in the SG&A line from operating leverage and our investments in technology, reducing SG&A to somewhere between 9.1% and 9.3% for the full year. There will be seasonality between the quarters with the first quarter being the lowest operating margin and the operating leverage is expected primarily in the second half of the year to match up with our highest volume quarters. Financial services are expected to be in the range of $155 million to $160 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread fairly similar to 2016 with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. With rising interest rates, we expect the strong refinance market that we did see in 2016 to start to slow down as we go through 2017. Rialto is expected to generate a range of profits between $45 million and $55 million for the year and the second half of the year is expected to have the bulk of the profitability for this segment. Multifamily expects to sell seven to eight multifamily communities in 2017 with a range of profits between $70 million and $80 million for the full year. We expect to be profitable each quarter with the fourth quarter profits similar to 2016's very strong fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income group together, we're expecting to have a range of $70 million to $80 million of profitability for this category and although we don't anticipate profitability in the first two quarters of the year out of this grouping, we do expect strong profitability in the second half of the year. Corporate G&A is expected to be between 2.2% and 2.3% of total company revenues as we continue to invest and repiping our systems and technology initiatives. As I mentioned our tax rate for 2017 should be approximately 34% and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 7% from our account of 695 with the increased spread throughout the year primarily in the second, third, and fourth quarters. And then finally we continue to focus on cash flow generation and expect to generate a similar level of operating cash flow in 2017 as we get into 2016. With these goals in mind we are well-positioned to deliver another strong profitable year in 2017. With that let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you. Congratulations guys on another solid quarter. Stuart, if you can talk a little bit about the usage of free cash flow that's very impressive in '17 and how to increase shareholder value with that free cash flow where they get deployed and thinking about the uncertainties, but as you've mentioned in your opening remarks, the positive potential business environment that we may or pro-business administration may be taking, thinking about the opportunities that you think will the pluses or minuses of the new administration at least what you've heard so far. I think people are pretty interested if you go into little bit more specific obviously tax reforms, some of the things that might drive how you invest that free cash flow to drive shareholder value?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So that was a multipart question, Ivy. I'm going to give you credit for the two point questions and your follow up on that. So to start off with you asked about free cash flow and how we might think to deploy that to enhance shareholder value and let me say hats off to Rick as he aptly negotiated our proposed deal with WCI. He injected great deal of optionality ‎for us in the way that we think about the use of cash versus stock when we do have optionality all the way for quite some time until closing. And so we're thinking about the way that we use cash to enhance shareholder value in all transactions whether it's the purchase of new land, whether it's other deals that we are considering opportunistically or whether it's the way that we use cash and stock. And we'll keep a lot of optionality injected in our program so that we can watch as the world around us given the new administration starts to really unfold. So we're very keenly considering how we think about the use of cash. We've injected lot of optionality and you can expect that that's going to be a primary focus for our corporate office. So that was part one. You asked about some of the discussion points and administrative changes that might come along with a new administration. We've been giving a lot of thought to that. There are some murkier waters, some questions around tax rate reductions and how they might ripple through, how they might result in cash savings. I think we're going to have to wait and see what the details are but as the landscape shifts, as a tax policy that has been articulated actually get formed, there are going to be some change agents in the way that customers think about whether or not they want to purchase or whether or not they have the capital to deploy. We think that the tax changes are going to have some significant impact not just to the individual or potential customers, but also to our corporate tax rate in the way that we kind of configure our organization. Corporate taxes as articulated are likely to go down, but what other elements of the tax code might change at the same time is something that we're going to have to say on top of. Around the regulatory environment, there's a whole host of regulatory constraint that has defined the housing market not the least of which is the way the banks have been not only regulated, but also prosecuted has certainly shifted the landscape for the mortgage industry or defined the landscape for the mortgage industry. What it seems to be like -- what seems to be lightning of that regulatory or prosecutorial environment would in my opinion result in more normalization of the mortgage market and therefore greater access to the mortgage market by the lower middle class, which I think would be healthy not only for the housing industry, but also for the economy in general and I think we've been saying that for a long time. All of these pieces as we see new administration come and as we see that confidence has been lifted, we'll see how that ripple through the selling season and how consistent it stays. All of these provide opportunities for us to look opportunistically about as to how we deploy our cash and how we think about cash flow turning into the building of shareholder value. So I hope that answers the question.
Ivy Zelman: It did. And my follow-up, would just be thank you, it was helpful, just the word you mentioned becoming a pure play homebuilder, can you elaborate on what that means and is there any other businesses…
Stuart Miller: Listen, we've said in past conference calls that our focus had shifted last year to saying okay, how do we position our ancillary businesses to bring them to where they ought to be. The goal for the company is to be a pure play homebuilder. Whether that includes our apartment effort or not is something that we're considering openly, that it might be inclusive of our multifamily program. So we hold that open to see how we think about it in the future, but clearly we've been focused on FivePoint and Rialto maturing and positioning those companies for other forms of ownership. We've articulated that FivePoint, we've looked at an IPO opportunity, the IPO market closed up on us and we're looking other strategic opportunities. We've really refined the ownership structure for FivePoint, so that it's positioned and ready to go, should the right opportunity come along and we're focused on that and looking for that. Likewise with Rialto, 2016 and continuing into 2017 as we resolve the legacy component of our asset base really refines Rialto to become a self-sufficient operation a lot like FivePoint already is and positions it to find its way into some different form of ownership. As we resolve these ancillary businesses, we really clarify our position as a pure play homebuilder defined by our core homebuilding business, financial services, which is a sidecar program and potentially by our multifamily group also. But as you can see with this year's performance on the multifamily side, we've really positioned that entity to also be have -- to have a lot of optionality and what we do with it because this is becoming a very valuable enterprise for the company and quite compatible with our core for-sale business.
Ivy Zelman: Great, that's very helpful. And congratulations again and happy holidays to all you guys.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Stephen East: Thank you. Thank you, Stuart for that explanation on your ancillary businesses. It takes you some questions there. So I'll go back to the gross margin that you all talked about 22% to 22.5%, as you look at 2017 what are the moving parts in driving that down? Is land still the biggest driver or do you see labor and materials and incentives moving up there? And then just an idea of where you all think it will bottom and roughly when you think that would occur?
Rick Beckwitt: Stephen, its Rick. As we said the past, land is certainly one of the drivers that affects the gross margin. We benefited from some opportunistic purchases. We're now more of a wholesale buyer of land that's affecting margin and we think that in that 22% to 22.5% range, that's a solid margin and it's -- as you know it's much higher than where the rest of the industry is. Another thing that's impacting that is our continuing shift towards the lower price market that those had lower gross margins but higher IRRs and that gets them to the overall strategy that we have as a company. Where the bottom is, I don’t think it's much lower than where we are in the 22% side and we're just going to have to see is that, that comes across. If you look at higher cycles for the industry somewhere in that 21% to 21.5% range has always been considered a pretty solid gross margin and we feel that operationally we should be able to do better than that.
Stuart Miller: Just add to that let me say that look there's some upside to the world as we think about it right now. I think in a lot of ways supply remains fairly constrained. As I noted in my comments the land and the labor markets are constraining factors in terms of how quickly the building industry can really respond. Increases in demand would give a little bit of pricing power. So there are lot of moving parts right now and a lot to consider. I think we'll have to wait and see. And Jon do you want to comment at all on the construction costs?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. As has been mentioned already there's real constraint in labor market, but I think that operationally we been very effective in managing that. We said it's up about 2% year-over-year for our single-family detached product and that's really come from a focus on our relationships with our trade partners with a real intensity towards programs such as job site readiness and ebb and flow and as always our everything's included strategy really helps us in a labor constrained market be simpler and more efficient to build. And we also see that in our cycle times as evidenced, it's come down consecutively from our second quarter to our third and now to our fourth quarter. We see reduction in a number of days of cycle time. So there's real pressure but I'm very proud of the way our management team is on top of that as a daily focus.
Stephen East: All right. Thanks. I appreciate that. And I did actually have one question on the ancillary businesses, on the four buildings that you sold, were the cap rate spreads between construction what you sold them for, what you expected? Are you seeing any change in the market? I know that the closer end A-plus luxury locations seem to be getting a bit forward but you all are aren't there. So I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in the profitability of these buildings as you sell them versus what you pro forma that?
Rick Beckwitt: Steve, it's Rick again. We were very strategic when we identified where we're going to roll out this program. And as we look at last quarter or even for last year, our underwriting has been tall as we're having 2 plus cash-on-cash multiples. We've got high double-digit IRRs. We're just knocking it off out of the park.
Stephen East: That’s all right. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Steve, if your question, are cap rates starting to move?
Stephen East: Yeah.
Stuart Miller: Yes, so I think -- I don’t think we've seen much movement in cap rate yet and whether there's going to be as interest rates go up, there are a lot of arguments around cap rates relative to the apartment world. We continue to have the view that the shortage in dwellings both rental and for-sale across the country that has been the result of the underproduction over the past years is going to continue to reflect in a fairly strong rental market, which makes this asset class very desirable. We've seen this as Rick's gone out and raised the capital for this build-to-core fund that we have in place. We've continued to see that internationally there is still a sizable demand for this asset class and while there will be some ebb and flow as certain portfolios of buyers get a little bit more full, we're fully loaded in this asset class, we'll see a little ebb and flow in some of those cap rates. I think directionally we're still going to see a fairly strong cap rate relative to the sale of these kinds of properties and their valuation.
Rick Beckwitt: And I guess that other detail I give you Steve is if you look at our portfolio, as Bruce said, we've got 74 communities in total. 40 of those in merchant build and balance 34 are in our fund as of today. So given if cap rates do moderate, we've got the ability to milk the asset through the income producing nature of fund and that was our strategic decision to have a dual prong strategy. I think that we're really well positioned to maximize this and as the market recovers, if the market softens and then recovers in the future, we're going to have this portfolio of two, three, four year old properties that we can certainly monetize it at that point.
Stephen East: I got you. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Mike Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter again. First question I was hoping to hit on some of the more recent sales trends that you've seen let's say over the last six weeks if it's still all possible to common obviously with the rate movement not being as dramatic as in short of a time what we saw in 2013, but we have had six weeks now of rate move that’s kind of totaled up at around 80 basis points. So I was hoping to get a little sense of number one how, how the order growth cadence occurred during 4Q and again as you think about November into the first half of December if you've seen any difference in at least in terms of the year-over-year obviously seasonality wise, it's a softer but from year-over-year or sequential periods it's seems a little different than what you would expect.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah Michael, it's Rick. We generally don't talk about anything in close quarter with regard to sales. What we can tell you is that as you look at our Q4, each month showed year-over-year increases with an increase throughout the quarter and percentage of year-over-year change.
Mike Rehaut: And would that be for total order growth or sales pace when you refer to the…
Rick Beckwitt: That would be for total order growth.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. And I appreciate that Rick and I guess just secondarily, when you think about the first time business and you kind of alluded to the fact that that can also or perhaps is having an impact on the direction of gross margins in '17 perhaps even further out than that. I was hoping if you could just remind us of what your first time business was as a percent of closings let's say in the fourth quarter, how that compares to the full year and where you might see that go over the next -- over the next 12 or 24 months.
Rick Beckwitt: We've been running in the high 30% from a percentage basis. If you look at the land that we've been contracting and we've certainly made a shift on that, you can expect that percentage to go up over the next year two years.
Bruce Gross: To about 40%, that's where we expect to be going forward.
Rick Beckwitt: Just more of a historical norm too.
Mike Rehaut: So it's high 30s to 40 doesn't seem too aggressive of a shift that can go to 45. Just given the increased focus and as you talk about it, I would expect something little bit more, is there anything that's constraining that because obviously it's something that I think a lot of the industry is moving towards.
Stuart Miller: We'll you know we've never been one to follow the herd. We've been more kind of self determined. We have a strong view that the product offerings that we have right now are pretty strong and while we are shifting back towards kind of a historical norm of where we think the percentages of first-time home buyer product that would like to have, we don't feel that with interest rates moving up, with the market still defining itself, we have the option to accelerate that pace if we want to. But we didn't feel that it was the right time to make a more dramatic shift.
Rick Beckwitt: And I think the other thing is that all this is definitional. On the edges we feel that there's still a good strong market in that lower-priced first time moved up market, which is a big component of our -- of our offering, product offering across U.S. So it's where you draw that line with regard to ASP.
Mike Rehaut: No it's fair points and worthwhile to be stated, so I appreciate the additional color. Thanks a lot guys.
Jon Jaffe: One more point on that, this is Jon that we also have our next gen strategy, which as Stuart said is more of a leadership position than a following position, which represents about 6% of our total sales and the average sales price of our next gen product offering is up 35% higher than our average sales price inclusive of that next gen pricing. So we do have different strategies that we think balance our offerings into the marketplace if that’s appropriate.
Mike Rehaut: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you and our next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is now open.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the WCI acquisition, I was wondering if you could say at this point based on what you see it had whether your intention is to keep the company's overall net leverage neutral as you look at that deal?
Stuart Miller: Jade as I said earlier, we really maintained maximum optionality there. We have a number of moving parts, number of things that we consider and are considering and so we're going to maintain that optionality and really not give additional color at this point just because we are considering other opportunities that are out there that we think compete for cash and balance sheet. And I think as you've seen us do before, we'll allocate capital in the direction where we think we can have the greatest impact on shareholder value over the long-term. So that's kind of where we would like to leave the answer to that right now.
Jade Rahmani: On the Rialto side, can you say whether you think the current M&A environment remains fruitful in terms of opportunities to grow the platform and whether any rollback of the Dodd Frank risk retention would have a negative impact on Rialto's business?
Stuart Miller: Our general view is that regardless of which way things go, relative to current regulation and some of our initial thinking around how the regulatory environment would benefit us, we're kind of positioned for prosperity, regardless of which way it goes. Think about a rising interest rate environment relative to our conduit business, our loan origination business, our B-Piece buying business, all of these arenas tend to be activated by changes in the environment. We think there's still a very strong case to be made for the dollars that we're investing and whether risk retention remains in place defines a new environment that we will help craft or whether we revert to the way things have been working in the past, we're just very well positioned to continue with a very strong strategy of producing outsized returns.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: You bet. Next question.
Operator: Thank you, yes. Next question is from John Lovallo of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
John Lovallo: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my call. First question is on homebuilding operating profit, if you just look at the low-end of the outlook that you guys put out there, it would seem to imply call very low single-digit growth in operating income. So I guess the question is, is there what kind of macro environment are you thinking about when you put that out there and also are there additional levers on the SG&A line that you might be able to pull understanding that you guys have hit all-time lows of the past few quarters.
Bruce Gross: Okay. John as far as the macro environment we're not assuming a very different macro environment from what you're seeing now. The reduction in gross margin is consistent with what we've been saying that some of the opportunistic land position that we purchased they're just not as large of a percentage of those as we go forward. And therefore the land cost is going up a little bit and construction costs have gone up a little bit. So not a different macro environment and SG&A levers, there's a lot of focus that we have is where we're typing all of the technology in our company and restore the benefit through digital marketing is how we've reduced advertising costs. We think there's an opportunity to continue to make progress really on all the line items that we have with our fixed marketing costs as well as continuing to grow organically will continue to lever the overhead in our divisions because we're not growing our divisions at the same pace that we're growing our overall volume.
Stuart Miller: Let me just add to it. I wanted to be very clear in my opening remarks. We're really looking at a steady-state environment as we craft our strategy going forward. But we think that there are some unique upside potentials out there and I've tried to articulate some of those. But the way that we're thinking about both our guidance and the way that we're crafting the strategy within the company, we've seen a lot of choppiness in the economic environment over the past quarters that we've and other builders have had to navigate. There are constraints on land. There are constraints on labor. So we recognize that the environment we have to look at is that’s consistent with where we are, but we think that there's opportunity for upside and that's how we've positioned the company.
John Lovallo: Okay. That's helpful. I guess the next question would be talking about the land and labor constraints, it sounded if I heard this correctly, you're looking for 7% community count growth and I think you said that's excluding WCI. If that is the case what do you guys attributing the ability to deliver that kind of community count growth to given the aforementioned headwinds.
Bruce Gross: That's excluding WCI, so 7% although as Stuart mentioned in his remarks, there is the opportunity that some of the WCI assets might replace some of the assets we were to bring online.
Stuart Miller: As we sit right now, it's a kind of complicated time for us to knit these pieces together because WCI as with any transaction that has been enclosed is a proposed transaction. But the WCI acquisition as it occurs and we believe it will, will knit together with some of these numbers and there won't be a clear distinction between them because some of the WCI communities are going to potentially replace communities that we might have purchased otherwise. Remember we're purchasing excellent communities that are already mature and underway and that's very attractive to us and our platform. So this will all dovetail into a narrative that will take greater shape after a closing.
John Lovallo: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Stephen Kim of Evercore. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys, this is actually [Trim] on for Steve Kim. Thanks for taking the questions. First could you talk about these new operating losses that are occurring in FivePoint and how long you're expecting those to continue to persist?
Bruce Gross: This is Bruce. So really when you look at FivePoint and all the joint ventures, they have overhead associated with them each quarter, that would result in a net operating loss unless there was a transaction of a land sale. So it's really then continuing to operate their business and it's a question of what quarter the land sales occur and it intends to bunch up. So my commentary about the quarters and the net operating losses is that the sales anticipated from the joint ventures are bunched up later in the year which means the overhead in the beginning of the year wants to be offset by any significant land sale transactions.
Stuart Miller: And that's one of the problems that we've identified relative to both Rialto and to FivePoint is that the revenues tend to be less predictable and sometimes lumpy, which really brings some confusion to the overall program wherein our homebuilding business we're able to give much greater guidance and it is much more consistently matched. Those two subsidiaries tend to have lumpier results and can sometimes bring a little confusion.
Unidentified Analyst: Got you. Thanks for that and then secondly, you gave your land spend in acquisition, but one what was your development and two, how are you thinking about going forward given the comments of your cash flow guide for relatively flat with this year which implies higher working capital, so maybe increased dollars in land spend next year.
Bruce Gross: So we actually had a reduction on our development spend during the quarter. Last year it was $266 million. This year's fourth quarter was $240 million. So overall when you look at land and land development together, even though we're growing the company, we actually spent less in total this year versus last year. And as we look at the positive cash flow generation for next year, that's just an estimate at this point. We're very focused on continuing the progress that we made this year and we'll continue to give you updates throughout the year, but our focus is continuing to improve the balance sheet and we'll remain opportunistic with what we do with that cash.
Unidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Nishu Sood of Deutche Bank.
Nishu Sood: Thank you. Wanted to ask you about the labor issue. So earlier last year and earlier this year when those problems were creeping up, but obviously expressed itself as rising direct construction costs and some delays in cycle times. Now both of those have come back the construction cost I think Bruce said were only up by 3% year-over-year down I think pretty nicely from where it was earlier. And I think John mentioned the cycle time is coming down as well. So should we think about that as being solely the results obviously your intent is to manage around that or are you seeing also some improvement in the market and your thoughts looking ahead on that issue as well that would be great, thank you.
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. We're seeing that there is pretty consistent level of constraint in labor in all the markets across the country. I think that our management team has done a particularly good job of focusing on the relationships with those trades to make sure that we're the builder of choice and it takes a lot of effort to focus and I think we're executing very well on that front.
Nishu Sood: Got it. So it sounds like mostly just the result of efforts. Okay and on the SG&A side, re-piping becoming more digitally oriented and in the selling efforts, it sounds as though that might also imply less fixed base in the SG&A and more variability perhaps. I'm trying to look into -- obviously the efforts have yielded terrific numbers particular second half of this year with the record lows as Stuart mentioned. Only I think 20 or 30 basis points of leverage into next year on SG&A. Does that mean a lot of that is in the business? Is it that kind of fixed versus variable distinction that I was just making. How should we think about that going forward?
Stuart Miller: I don't think that we've added variability. I don't think we've made that as a migration. I think we've just pulled cost out of the equation. When I look at and think about our migration from conventional to digital marketing, we've basically cut many of our advertising and marketing costs in half. While we have not increased traffic, we've actually reduced actual foot traffic, but to a much higher quality of traffic. So our conversion rates have gone way up and this has really created less stress in the system. Remember that this one element is a proxy for many other areas that we're focused on around our SG&A. But some of the results about what our digital marketing platform has done really get a little bit interesting to me because it's not just about the reduction in cost, it's about the ability to drive traffic and to continue to enhance what we're already doing. So just some stats, our digital marketing resulted in Internet leads being up 35% to over 90,000. Our social media followers are up 22% to 2.7 million and our YouTube views are up by 11 million to 33 million. These are really big numbers that derive from the ability to actually focus on something and to use digital technologies to our advantage. Now when we talk about re-piping our system, we're re-piping the operational side of our business to be able to apply the same focuses to things like even flow and even distribution of closings through a quarter. To focus on a number of components of our business that we think can eliminate duplication in the way that we handle our financial accounting and the distribution of information through our company and as these things are applied, we think we can have the same meaningful actual reduction in cost as we go forward.
Nishu Sood: Got it. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Why don’t we take one more question.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. And our last question is from Jay McCanless of Wedbush. Your line is now open.
Jay McCanless: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. On the community count, you talked about I believe up 7% as a little bit faster than what we were expecting. Could you talk about where you expect to grow the bulk of the communities?
Bruce Gross: I got to look most of their community growth are in that asset investment really close to our larger markets California, Texas and Florida. We have spent, intensified our effort in the Carolinas and in Georgia. So you'll see increased community count growth from those areas.
Jay McCanless: Okay. And then on the cancellation rate, looks like it was down or up about 100 basis points year-over-year. Can you guys talk about what's going on there and is that part of what you were discussing before about vetting some of the people that come in to the community centers or that come into the Internet vetting them a little more closely before actually accepting the order.
Bruce Gross: Yes Jay, it actually went from 17% to 18% but both of those members are below the normal averages. So I wouldn’t look at going from 17% to 18%, anything other than just some rounding. There's no issue with cancellations, it's well below long-term averages that we've experienced.
Jay McCanless: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
David Collins: Okay. So we'll wrap up there. Thanks for joining. Just in conclusion let me say 2016 was a great year for the company. We're really pleased with the results not just in terms of bottom line, but also in operational positioning and we look forward to reporting throughout 2017. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Thank you. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, your CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. And I am here this morning joined by an assorted group of our management team, including Bruce, of course, our Chief Financial Officer; Rick Beckwitt our President; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto; and some others. But those will be the primary participants. I am going to briefly give some remarks and then Bruce will jump in with some additional detail and then we will open up to Q&A. And as usual, I would like to request that we can get as many questions as possible in our hour that you limit yourself to one question and just one follow-up please. So, great. Let me go ahead and begin and say that our third quarter 2016 results reflect yet another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We have consistently believed that we are in a slow steady, though sometimes choppy, housing market recovery, and we have crafted our operating strategies specifically to position us well to grow steadily and consistently and to act opportunistically in these market conditions. As we have noted over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that continued to grow over the past years. This deficit is particularly focused on the first time homebuyer segment of the market, and this part of the market was rather late to begin its slow and steady improvement as well. While questions have been raised as to the real normalized levels of production that are required to serve the growing U.S. population, we continue to believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of the American household growth that is now normalizing. Additional questions have been raised as the effect of an increase in interest rates relative to the recovery for first time homebuyers segment. We believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others. And this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady, sometimes erratic market improvement that will not be derailed by slow movements in interest rate, and this goes for both first-time and move-up purchasers. With that said, it’s important to note that the housing market is not really a national market, but instead it’s a large number of very local markets each with different dynamics that are averaged together – that generate some sometimes quirky results and data. While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, wage growth, and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We continue to expect that demand will build and come to market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit in housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, availability of land and labor shortages continue to be limiting factors and constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand while the mortgage market and higher rents continue to limit that demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow, steady, positive homebuilding market and will enable slow and steady growth throughout the industry. These have been our consistent guiding views over the past years and we have mapped our operating strategy around these views. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Now, against that backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for-sale homebuilding operations continue to operate at a very high level of efficiency with a steady growth pace and a focus on operational excellence. Our results reflect execution of our operating strategy as our new home orders increased 8% year-over-year while community count grew 3%, and our average home price grew 3% to approximately $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has managed sales prices, maximized margins, and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.2% for the third quarter. This focus has helped improve our balance sheet as well with our net homebuilding debt to total cap coming in at just below 40% with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter. As we have noticed – as we have noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has gotten more expensive. We have noted three components of our core homebuilding strategy. One, soft pivot; two, target lower growth rate; and three, focus on SG&A. We have talked consistently and extensively about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years away from LEN’s heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages in the recovery. We are now targeting high-quality A location land acquisitions with a shorter 2- to 3-year average life. Additionally, we have ramped up our first-time homebuyer offering organically with lower land cost as that segment of the market continues to recover. Second, we have noted in the past quarterly conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in orders to concurrently grow bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% at 10% range as we have redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. Third, with less pressure on top line growth, we have intensified management focus and driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of What We can Measure, We Can Change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operations. I noted an example last quarter and highlighted that we have been reducing customer acquisition costs through our digital marketing initiatives. We have expanded our focus to other operational elements of our business and are seeing reductions in expenses in those areas as well. It is noteworthy that this quarter’s SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest third quarter SG&A in our company’s history. Our homebuilding operations are becoming extremely efficient operating machines. With demand rowing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for steady growth and as well the ability to use a strong balance sheet to act opportunistically. Moving on, our financial services group is continuing to expand and improve and has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we have also benefited from a strong, though sometimes erratic refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities have continued to expand our platform as we have moved through 2016 and that’s reflected in our operating earnings of $53.2 million, up 35% over last year. Our strategy for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. Next, our multifamily platform continues to develop as the leading blue-chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The third quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for-sale homebuilding operations. With the home ownership rate continuing its decline, now dropping just below 63%, many new households have either been forced or are inclined to rent rather than purchase and have focused on – and we have focused on building well located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First-time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While the growing percentage of our for-sale homebuilding business continues to be geared towards first-time purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well. As we have continued to expand our national footprint, we have matured and evolved from a merchant build program, which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase has worked extremely well, as reflected in the sales of properties we have recorded to-date and the additional sales that will close in the fourth quarter as well. Through those sales, we have proven our ability to purchase, to design, build, stabilize and sell quite profitably a number of our communities at an increasing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added to – or added a build-to-core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have currently a solid $2 billion for our build-to-core platform, which will become a long-term cash flowing – cash producing, fee generating value creation machine. While multifamily production has generally normalized and some have expressed concerns about over building in some markets, nationally, more rental product is going to continue to be needed to fill the national production deficit. And we are very well positioned to continue to be very careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our multifamily platform. Our now $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed, as rental rates have climbed to exceed our original underwriting and vacancies remained at very low levels. Next, our Rialto segment saw a nice turnaround in the third quarter as the capital markets stabilized after a rough start in the first half of 2016. During the quarter, market conditions continued to improve and RMF completed – Rialto Mortgage Finance completed its 30th and 31st securitization transaction with gross margins ranging from 5.4% to 5.7% and with almost $500 million of RMF originated loans. Rialto Mortgage Finance maintained its position as one of the largest non-bank CMBS loan originators. With the rebound in the market, the securitization transactions occurring this quarter, generated the single largest contribution of loans Rialto Mortgage Finance has ever made and also the largest net margin for a single transition – transaction in our history. This brings our total to almost $6 billion of securitized loans since RMF’s inception. On the asset management front, we also previously announced the first closing of commitments of our third fund. And although we can’t really say anything more as we are still in the market, this fund will complement our other opportunistic fund with readily available capital to invest as we have approximately $920 million of investor equity dedicated to mezzanine and transitional lending in those other funds. Our first two flagship opportunity funds have both been top quartile performers. Fund one became fully invested in early 2013 and we now distributed 135% of investors’ original capital from income and monetization. And with the distribution through this quarter, Rialto now has already realized 2x its original best investment with a lot more to go. We expect to begin to report, promote on this first fund in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our fund and asset management business shows improved profitability over last year’s second – last year’s third quarter and we expect this trend to continue. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short-term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycle. The dysfunction that we saw earlier this year in the financial market, along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations, are beginning to work to the benefit of Rialto’s core competent and CMBS and financial products and we have the capital available to invest. Finally, FivePoint is now a self sufficient standalone company that is a premier strategic large scale community builder. As we stated in our last quarterly conference call, we contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in this newly formed entity. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint’s evolution as the strategic developer and manager of large scale master planned communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar’s strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base as it liberates FivePoint to act independently, raise capital and utilize its pristine balance sheet to operate opportunistically. FivePoint will operate very independently with a self contained management team under the leadership of Emil Haddad, who many of you know. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future for this one of a kind leader in community development. So in summary, overall let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our third quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that have defined our various business segments continue to work very well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I have said many times before, we believe very confidently that we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. Now let me turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks Stuart and good morning. I will provide some more color on our businesses and conclude with an update on our 2016 goals. Revenues from home sales increased 11% in the third quarter, driven by a 7% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the third quarter was 22.6%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year’s gross margin percentage was 24.1%. The gross margins decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives were 5.9% this quarter compared to 5.6% in the prior year, with the largest increase coming from the Houston segment, particularly with higher price communities. Gross margin percents were once again highest in the East region. Direct construction costs have increased moderately compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2.5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot. This was driven entirely by labor offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart mentioned, SG&A as a percentage of revenue improved – it improved by 60 basis points as we were successful gaining operating leverage by growing volume organically in existing homebuilding divisions and from the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. Other income was $30.9 million primarily due to a gain of $8.7 million on the sale of a clubhouse, which we originally were projecting to close in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we had $17 million of management fee income from one of our strategic joint ventures. Equity in large from unconsolidated entities was $18 million, which included our share of the loss related to the $17 million that I just mentioned in other income and our share of net operating losses and one-time charges from the newly created FivePoint entity in combination that Stuart mentioned. This quarter, we opened 66 new communities and ended the quarter with 694 net active communities. Our sales pace was higher compared to the prior year at 3.4 sales per community per month versus 3.2 in prior year’s quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 16% in the third quarter. And we purchased approximately 5,400 home sites totaling $264 million versus $267 million in the prior year’s quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy where we are focused on buying shorter duration land. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 159,000 home sites, of which 129,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled. We brought down our completed unsold homes during the quarter. It came down 19% sequentially to 973 homes. Turning to financial services, they had strong results this quarter with operating earnings of $53.2 million compared to $39.4 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to $38.3 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. The improved earnings were driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Mortgage originations increased to $2.6 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year as a result of a focused effort to capitalize on the low mortgage rates in the third quarter, we achieved a 56% increase in refinance origination volume versus the prior year. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers remains consistent with the prior year at 82% capture rate. And our title company also had a strong quarter. Their profits increased to $15 million from $8.2 million in the prior year and that was also primarily due to higher refinance transaction volume in the current year. Additionally, they had a great focus on operational efficiencies driving additional bottom line profit. Turning to Rialto, this segment produced operating earnings of $5.9 million compared to $9 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed $27.6 million of earnings, which include $6 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and $21.6 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $141 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $491 million of commercial loans into two securitizations resulting in earnings of $27.2 million compared with $519 million and $14.2 million in the prior year respectively. And that’s before their G&A expense. The increase in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the net margins. This year was 5.4% in the third quarter versus last year’s third quarter at 3.1% net margin. Our direct investments had a loss of $5.6 million during the quarter. And Rialto G&A and other expenses were $36.2 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding the warehouse lines, was $7.1 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $133 million of cash. The multifamily segment delivered a $2.6 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment’s $8 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties and 37 under construction, 10 of which are in lease up, totaling over 11,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $3.2 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 20,000 apartments. Our tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared to 30% in the prior year’s period. The rate is lower than expected for this quarter as a result of our continued efforts to maximize the new home energy efficiency credit, which was extended into 2016. We will continue to focus on maximizing this energy credit. And therefore, we believe the tax rate for the fourth quarter will also be lower than previously expected. We believe that will be a range of 33% to 34%. Our balance sheet is strong. Our operating strategies had focused on driving cash flow generation. And this quarter, we generated positive operating cash flow. Liquidity remained strong with approximately $568 million of homebuilding cash and $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which during the quarter was increased to $1.8 billion. Our leverage improved by 650 basis points year-over-year as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 39.9%. We grew stockholders’ equity by 22% to $6.5 billion and our book value per share increased to $28.73 per share. During the quarter, we early converted an additional $175 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes. And for the year, we have now converted a total of $243 million of those notes. Our next debt maturity matures in June of 2017 and we look forward to retiring $400 million of 12.25% senior notes, which currently cost us $50 million per interest per year. Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. We are still on track with our 2016 goals with a few refinements for the fourth quarter. First, deliveries are still on track with our original 2016 goal to deliver between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. The fourth quarter is projected to achieve a backlog conversion right at 90%. We expect the average sales price for these deliveries to be between $355,000 and $360,000 per home. Turning to margins, the gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter is projected to be approximately 23.25%. And we are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in the company’s history in 2016 with our fourth quarter expected to see another 50 basis points reduction sequentially below the third quarter’s 9.3%. So, that would bring it around 8.8% for the fourth quarter. Financial services, our second and third quarter are typically the highest profit quarters for LFS. However, given the continued favorable interest rate environment, we are also increasing our goal for the fourth quarter for this segment to a range of $37 million to $40 million for the quarter. Rialto earnings are projected to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million of profit for the fourth quarter. And multifamily, based on our favorable sale expectations for between 4 and 5 communities for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our multifamily goal to a range of $30 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter. Joint ventures, land sales and the other income, which I will group together, we were successful in accelerating some of the projected fourth quarter land sale and clubhouse transactions into our third quarter. So, we are now updating our projection to this category to $5 million for the fourth quarter. And then finally with our balance sheet, as we noted, our third quarter net debt to total capital has come down below 40% and we are well on our path to lower leverage. As Stuart mentioned with our operating strategies, our strong projected earnings, our soft pivot strategy and converting the remainder of the 3.25% convertible, which will shift from debt to equity in the fourth quarter, all of this will continue to lead to lower leverage, which has given us a rock solid balance sheet and positions us well for opportunities as we finish out 2016. Let me now turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Bob Wetenhall: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and good morning. A lot of focus on gross margins, and Stuart has been consistently talking about the soft pivot strategy, and I was hoping, instead of just focusing on this quarter, we could kind of walk through your thinking process on gross margin and profitability in the context of your comments about delivery growth of 7% to 10% annually, it sounds a little bit like you are doing more with less inventory, but you are keeping margins high, I am just trying thinking about the trajectory of how this unfolds, not just today, but more in 2017 and 2018?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So we have been pretty consistent Bob, in saying that we expect our gross margins to be drifting down. We highlighted that at the beginning of this year and as we move through last year as well. But we also focused attention on net operating margin primarily recognizing that as land that was bought at very low prices flow through our system, margins would be higher. As that land dissipated and we ended up with more shorter-term land, our margins would – our gross margins would drift down. But we felt that as the recovery matured, we would continue to focus on bringing down our growth rate, focusing on efficiencies in our SG&A as we have been articulating and really driving increased earnings through more efficient net operating margin. Let me turn to Rick and Jon and have them weigh in on that.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. This is Rick. The natural evolution of a soft pivot is that you are starting to take less risk in land. Associated with that risk profile is a margin presence. You are looking for near-term opportunities, quicker turns, so gross margin will naturally come down and IRRs will come up. And so, when we are going less long on some of these positions, it means that you are paying a little bit closer to retail than you were in buying wholesale. The other thing that we have been doing is we really been managing pace in price. A great example of that is notwithstanding the fact that the Houston market is definitely softer, given the turmoil in the energy market. But if you look at our performance there for the last quarter, sales were up by 14%, but our ASP was up by 4%. So in a tough market, we are really trying to maximize the value of the quality assets that we got there and not give the homes away. We certainly could have sold more homes, but we are just really managing it.
Jon Jaffe: Hi Bob, it’s Jon. Just to add on, in addition to the impact we see from the land strategy, we continue to manage in that environment on each community price and pace balance. If you look at for example, California and Florida, this past quarter, we averaged over one sale per week. It’s a really healthy pace and we are doing that in an environment where there isn’t the same kind of pricing power there was a year ago, so all that – that will drive our net operating margin to maintain a very healthy rate while we see that compression on our gross margin.
Bob Wetenhall: Well, I have got to say, you guys are doing a nice job of striking the balance between price and pace, and thanks for articulating how this unfolds. Maybe as the second question and follow-up, Stuart has made reference to the ancillary businesses starting to mature, and obviously, expectations for multifamily making a much larger contribution in 4Q are becoming visible, and the Rialto business sounds like the promote is going to become much more visible in the second – in the first half of 2017, can you give us a little bit of a roadmap for thinking about the timing and how you might monetize these assets, it sounds like you’ve had a lot of progress bringing them up the curve, it sounds like they are kind of ripe, how should we be thinking about the game plan as you revert to a pure play homebuilder moving through the cycle? Thanks and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Right. So thanks Bob. Look, we have been very focused on that notion of reversion to pure play. And that’s a story that’s going to play out over the next couple of years. This construct doesn’t change overnight. We have highlighted very clearly that FivePoint is our starting point in all of that. FivePoint, we have seen a consolidation of our interest and unification under a corporate umbrella, where – which is being overseen by its CEO, Emile Haddad. And FivePoint is positioned to see it evolve into its own independent company managed by its own complement of executives and overseen by its own unique Board of Directors, which parenthetically myself, Rick, and Jon are part of. That’s an example of how we will continue to think about our ancillary businesses move them through the system. The second area is in the apartment area. You are already starting to see a migration through that merchant-build program and towards our build-to-core program, which in many ways is a very separate program. It again, like FivePoint has its own complement of management and that builds a core program as an opportunity for us to build a stream of earnings that is consistent, it’s fee generative, and enables us to realize on the great value that we are creating. Rialto continues to build to be able to be strategic in its alignment for the future, but we don’t have a current path for Rialto that we have articulated. But as Rialto’s asset management and RMF, Rialto Mortgage Finance businesses continue to grow, we think that there are tremendous opportunities for that company to combine to IPO to do a variety of things as we really start to focus on the core homebuilding business.
Rick Beckwitt: And it’s Rick, Bob. One sort of data point is if you look at Q4, we are guiding to an increase between $10 million and $15 million just for the multifamily growth. So I think you will start to see a more consistent level of big nominal profitability for quarter as we build through the merchant build program and get into that cash recurring fee generating core program. So that will become very visible.
Stuart Miller: Okay, next question.
Operator: Next question is from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line now is open.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you and good morning guys, good quarter, 15 in a row meeting expectations. I guess what I would like to address is if I could with all of you is sort of the elephant in the room right, the investment community is very focused on looking at compression of gross margins, which we appreciate that, that’s sort of a natural progression of one of the gap you guys have close between retail versus the stress. And Stuart, I think you have done a great job in articulating that message for quite some time, but the big concern is that you are not be able to grow operating earnings in homebuilding as margins, even with the improvement in SG&A dropped down, your EBIT margin, operating margin from homebuilding is down year-over-year, although it’s amongst the highest of the sector. And I think what we would love to hear, this cycle is different in many ways and when you look at the multi-year outlook, can you continue to drive improvements in ROE, utilizing the cash flow you are generating to drive shareholder value and give investors on the line more confidence that there is growth and probably better than S&P and alternative, with the stock down I think it’s very near-term focus on gross margins, which they are not seeing the bigger picture, so if you can elaborate sort of your vision and how do you generate better cash flows through the strategy that will ultimately drive returns?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So that’s a great question. And I think it is on a lot of people’s minds. Our view has been that our gross margins will continue to drift downwards. I think if you look at the average of the industry, if you look at what’s normalized gross margin in the industry, you are probably looking at 21%, 22%. And over time, we will probably drift in that direction. The industry average might even be lower than that. But I would say a few things. We have a lot of guns in our arsenal. We have been very focused on operational efficiency. We are not focusing on stretching growth in an environment that just isn’t giving it easily. Land is expensive. Land is hard to come by. People are expensive and hard to come by. It’s hard to grow operations efficiently and effectively at an accelerated rate in a market where land and labor is really constrained. And so we have chosen to focus on operational efficiencies as a mechanism for driving profitability going forward. And we have been consistently articulating look at the net operating margin where we will find much more stability and the opportunity to drive profitability going forward from our core business. But with that said, we have also articulated other strategies. Look at our financial services group, we have been diversifying that group, not only is it growing alongside of our core homebuilding business, it’s growing outside of that homebuilding operation and we are finding additional earnings by leveraging that part of our business. Look at Rialto, look at our multifamily effort, look at our ancillaries and you start to see that there are real growth components that derive from a core homebuilding operation that’s operating well and these ancillary businesses that are operating cooperatively.
Rick Beckwitt: And Ivy, this is Rick again. It’s really that balance of case and price again. If we wanted to grow volume at a much higher clip, we could certainly enter into contract for some additional communities that are at the normalized margins that the rest of the builders are building at. And we have chosen up through this point to keep an above industry margin even though it’s been drifting somewhat downward. And if you go back and you look at this business over multiple cycles, multiple time points, if you are somewhere around 20% growth you are doing a pretty good job. We have just chosen to be north of that and we will continue to be north of where that normalized curve is.
Ivy Zelman: That’s really helpful. But I think to just take it one step further, if you think about the cash flow that assuming that you will generate strong cash flows and knowing investors are looking for companies that can reinvest that cash flow to drive shareholder value beyond the ancillary businesses that are maturing and should drive returns, would you consider share buyback and other alternatives or do you want the maturation process of the ancillary businesses to drive the returns and should we expect returns to continue to move on an upward trajectory even if homebuilding might be pivoting, can you still grow the absolute operating income of homebuilding over the strategy you have deployed?
Stuart Miller: No, look, as I said, we have a lot of guns in our arsenal and our ancillary businesses are a very positive part of that construct, but we have continued to focus everyone’s attention on the core. And we think we can continue to drive the core forward. Yes, there are opportunities to either buyback stock or through acquisition to expand our platform and we hold both of those opportunities open to ourselves. We are generating the cash where we can go down either route and the opportunities out there to us given our current position are very strong.
Ivy Zelman: Thanks, guys. Good luck.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I just wanted to kind of circle back to the ancillary businesses and obviously appreciate all the detail and it’s exciting to see how those are maturing over time. Just wanted to try and get a sense, Stuart, as you have talked to the different three core businesses, Rialto, LMC and/or LMF and FivePoint, I know FivePoint is taking different twist and turns in terms of its maturation and future in the last 18 months. And so may be that’s a little harder to kind of pinpoint or get a sense of when that might kind of become its own separate entity, separate from Lennar that is on a more complete basis. But perhaps, you could talk to Rialto and LMC, I am sorry, LMF, how do you think about those businesses in terms of being a part of the broader Lennar family over the next 2 or 3 years. Obviously, Rialto itself is taking a lot of strides, is that something that might – that you are looking for an exit over the next year to some early for multifamily and now that, that’s closer to more of a recurring revenue streams that’s something that you just see kind of an ongoing part of the business from a broader corporate umbrella sense or could this be, are you still weighing other options for that business as well?
Stuart Miller: Well, okay, so as it relates to Rialto – well, I am sorry, let me start with FivePoint. As it relates to FivePoint, which where you started might – FivePoint trajectory has been very consistent and very positive. The properties in FivePoint had been moving through their system and the consolidation of FivePoint’s ownership under one umbrella is a consistent theme. What hasn’t been consistent on market conditions, we had embarked on a program to launch an IPO, which under good market conditions would have gone off by now. So, the market is the market, we can’t do much to change that, but the underlying operations of FivePoint are spectacular. As it relates to LMC, our multifamily platform, I think that there is a very strong case to be made that, that business really is almost part of the core. It has been a part of our strategy for dealing with the first-time homebuyer segment, which has been forced or inclined to rent rather than to purchase because of market conditions or because of appetites. And in fact, that strategy has worked out quite well for us and might be a very compatible program under the core umbrella. So, we are not – we are certainly not targeting right now a spin-off or some other kind of program relative to that segment and we will have to see over time. As it relates to Rialto, Rialto was built with the understanding that it would be synergistic to our – to the growth of our core business and it was in fact through the downturn. We have grown Rialto into a business that looks an awful lot like the business that we have spun-off back in 1997 under the name Eleanor. And it continues to grow along those lines. Now, there has been choppiness in the capital markets. There are questions around the regulatory environment. We think that each of these things work to our benefit. And as we continue to grow the platform, we want to let these things resolved themselves before we designed and put forth an exit strategy, but ultimately, Rialto will standalone.
Rick Beckwitt: Let me just add one thing on the multifamily group is given that we have pivoted to a built-to-core program, we essentially had the business that is self-funded to build out about $4 billion to $4.5 billion of apartment communities on a development cost base. When that’s done, it will be a portfolio that’s cash producing that we as a company will have tremendous optionality as to what we do with it. If it makes sense keeping in size and that creates the most shareholder value, we will keep it inside if it makes sense to do something outside of that, but when it gets to that point where it’s constantly turning our cash, there is going to be a lot of different things that we can do.
Michael Rehaut: Thank you. I appreciate that. It all makes sense. I guess, just secondly and Stuart, you referenced this, in terms of Lennar multifamily with the first-time and rent versus owned. How do you think about that kind of going back to – shifting back to your core homebuilding operations for a moment, you had a little bit of sales pace growth year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that’s consistent with the first half. Actually, it’s a little stronger than the first half on a year-over-year basis, the absorption – year-over-year absorption growth. Is first-time starting to play a little bit of a larger role there. And as you think about the 7% to 10% growth going forward, would you still expect there to be driven by perhaps roughly equally community count growth and absorption pace?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, with regard to the first time buyer business, as Stuart said in his quote, we have ramped up that business. If you look at where we stood at the end of the quarter, about 40% of our communities across the U.S. are first time buyer. And we haven’t highlighted that. We have been behind the scenes, increasing our positions in the core markets that are really geared to that first time buyer. And you will continue to see that play out over the next couple of years. Jon, do you want to talk about the growth?
Jon Jaffe: I think we are seeing in all of our markets even the ones that you wouldn’t necessarily associate with first time buyers ability through higher density our product strategies to increase our exposure to that market as that market improves. So I think you will see a ramp up, it’s not only in the natural place like Texas, but you will see in the California markets, in Nevada and Florida as well.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line now is open.
Stephen East: Thank you. Good morning guys. Stuart, can you talk a little bit more, as you do your soft pivot, which you have talked about for a few years now and it’s executing, but as we move forward, it sounds like that’s gaining a little momentum, so I am trying to understand what happens to your land supply as you move forward, are you going to shrink even though you are growing 7% to 10%, what’s that imply for your cash flow generation as you move through it and I will stop there for now?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So that’s exactly the strategy Steve, is our land supply relative to our production should be moderating. Our cash flow should be accelerating and we should continue to be enhancing our balance sheet. And as I have articulated in my remarks, our balance sheet has been improving. We are starting to see that soft pivot reflect. We are buying less land relative to the amount of production that we are generating. And of course, that’s been accelerating by slowing the growth pace, we are increasing the cash flow. We have seen our balance sheet improve and it will continue to improve as we go into the fourth quarter. I think Bruce highlighted that we will be reducing our rather expensive debt in June of 2017. All of these are balance sheet enhancements. And they enable us to have an awful lot of options in terms of being able to access capital and deploy capital either in the form of returning capital to shareholders, as was asked earlier or in the form of finding unique opportunities to grow our business in strategic ways. And of course, you know that we look at all of those as real opportunities within the company. So it’s very much been a part of the strategy to get to exactly the place that we are at right now.
Stephen East: Okay. And do you, as a part of that, two quick follow-ons to that and then a different question, do you accelerate your land sales, you had a little bit higher than what we expected this quarter, so is that a part of the plan also to just monetize in a different way than putting a house on it. And this last cycle, you all were by far the earliest in taking advantage. And so as you sit here taking advantage of the market, as you sit here and evaluate between share repurchases and being patient in building cash on the balance sheet to take advantage of that, can you tell me sort of what the key drivers of your thought process might be in that evaluation. And then totally different, your incentives creeped up, just what’s going on there, what’s driving it, is this just sort of the new, lay of the land, if you will or was there something going on?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So that’s a compound question. You get credit for asking three in one. But Rick do you want to go?
Jon Jaffe: It’s Jon. On land sales Steve, those are as always with our company opportunistic. Our soft pivot strategy is much more about the acquisition side than the disposition. And we will look at opportunities where we map a longer land position and how we care that down to better fit our soft pivot strategy. But the core principle there is how we approach shorter term acquisitions. With respect to incentives, as Bruce highlighted in his comments, that really was driven for a company by what’s going on in Houston. As you look across our marketplace as I would say incentives maintain a very stable level. We don’t see sort of the norm being increase incentives at all.
Rick Beckwitt: Okay. One clarification, because I think as a company across the nation, we are going through soft pivot. But that does not mean that we won’t to take advantage of excellent Class A assets, well located, good values, good strategic fit even if there are longer runway. And it’s the overall totality of the blend of the long and the short that has consistently made us successful in differentiate us as a company.
Stuart Miller: Yes. And look, that’s – it’s a great point that Rick makes. It’s a very important clarification. We are out there buying land and we are buying it. We are taking that core competence that we have got and we are buying strategically. As we move into and accelerate our position, relative to certain markets, relative to the first time homebuyer, we do it rather aggressively. Soft pivot is a way of thinking and it’s recognizing that we might buy a 5-year piece of land or a 7-year piece of land, but we might carve off half of it or a third of it in a land sale so that we are not holding it on our books. If you look at our land spend, we are spending significant dollars preparing for our future and ensuring that we are growing consistently. And we do it as well as better than anybody in the industry. So you can expect that we are still a land player and that there will be some additional land sales because of the way that we are thinking about the whole period. But we are still very active in the market.
Stephen East: Got it. Do you feel comfortable building out cash and holding on your balance sheet waiting for a similar opportunity as you got in ‘09 and ‘10, etcetera, or what’s your thought process on evaluating that versus going ahead and spending on a share repurchase type program?
Stuart Miller: I think that we are very disciplined in our approach and the accumulation of cash is not going to burn a hole in the bottom of our pocket. We are stuck to a strategy. Thus far, we are going to stick to it as we go forward unless we believe that there is a different strategy that is significantly better. And we haven’t come to that yet given the market conditions, given the maturity of the cycle, we feel very comfortable with the position that we are in and we are going to be able to drive consistent growth and be positioned for opportunity.
Stephen East: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Your line now is open.
Stuart Miller: Good morning Steve.
Stephen Kim: Good morning. Thanks very much guys for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow-on to the comment you made about targeting first time buyers that’s maybe a little bit more density and some innovation on the product side, obviously you guys have been pretty much industry leaders, I would say over the last decade in terms of product innovation, so we don’t doubt that you have the ability to come up with what’s next in terms of the product, however, mindful that you already own about 5 years worth of lots give or take, but that sometimes permitting restrictions, make it difficult to sort of take yesterday’s land and put tomorrow’s product on it in some places, can you help us understand how much future land spend do you think is needed to accommodate the innovation, the kind of product you are going to be initiating over the next or launching over the course of the next couple of years, how much of that is going to be have to be from future land spend versus what you already own today. And I am thinking particularly if you can maybe say 2 years from now, how much of the active land base at that time is already owned by you today?
Stuart Miller: I would say that most of that is really owned by us now. On a net-net basis, that’s going to be – will basically be flat on an inventory level.
Stephen Kim: In dollars, you mean?
Stuart Miller: In dollars. When we are talking about that first-time buyer, if that’s what your question was about? I was a little confused.
Stephen Kim: Yes, I was talking about the first-time buyer, specifically that segment of the market. Okay. So then, I guess, the next question...
Bruce Gross: Net flat.
Stephen Kim: Can you say that again?
Bruce Gross: Net flat.
Stuart Miller: Net flat, because they are going to be quicker churn deals, Steve.
Stephen Kim: Okay, alright. That’s great. And then second question relates to your comments about soft pivot, obviously there has been a lot of questions and you are probably going to continue to be there. One question that I had is whether or not there are certain geographies that are more conducive to this shift in strategy, in other words, over the course, again, over the course 2 to 3 years, should we expect a natural shift in your geographic exposure as a result of what you are seeking to do with your soft pivot strategy?
Stuart Miller: Well, the markets that are more conducive to the softer pivot are ones that have a broader base of third-party developers. So, if you think about the Texas markets, parts of the Carolina, some of Florida, parts of California, where there is an emerging third-party development market, those are more conducive to having someone else by the land, produce it to you and being shorter term deals to the extent that we have to be the developer of course. We take on a longer term obligation associated with buying, developing and building.
Stephen Kim: That’s kind of what I was thinking. Okay, thanks very much guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Let’s take the last question.
Operator: That is noted. The next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is open.
Ryan Tomasello: This is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Just going back to the Rialto side with risk retention implementation quickly approaching for December, I was wondering if you could provide an update on that opportunity and if you are seeing any demand from third-party capital and the potential to raise funds around that strategy?
Stuart Miller: Well, I will let Jeff weigh in, in a second, but I will say that we are well into our capital raise. We have the capital available to be well-positioned for the market as it evolves. But the way that the market is evolving raises perhaps more questions than answers at this particular point and requires some experimentation. So, there isn’t real clarity from the market standpoint around risk retention at this point. But in the midst of confusion, if you have capital, the opportunities abound. So Jeff, why don’t you take it from there?
Jeff Krasnoff: Yes, we have continued to try to be industry leaders and innovators in this area. And some of the banks, in terms of, I don’t know how much you have been following what’s been going on, but some of the banks have actually been trying to get some of the plumbing done in advance of the December 24 date when the new rules go into effect. And we have been right there side by side with them. As a matter of fact, the first risk retention compliant deal was done by actually by three banks that we participated in. We were basically chosen at the end of the day because of our ability to really help with this sort of innovation. Now, it wasn’t required to be done, but the idea was to try to get it done. A couple of other banks are also looking at that and are looking at other alternatives. And for those of you who don’t know risk retention basically means that if you are originating loans to be securitized that you have to retain 5% of the economics of this transaction to basically show you have some – that you are eating your own cooking. But they left an exception just for CMBS that says that you can bring in what’s called a B-Piece buyer, of which we are the largest B-Piece buyer in the market and have been through our fund vehicles since the market started coming back in 2010, 2011. So – but there are, let’s say, there are three or four other ways that we sort of have three or four different ponies in this race that we also have in terms of structures that we are working with originators, of which we are through RMF, which we are as well and we remain very optimistic about how this is going to play out.
Stuart Miller: At the end of the day, this is our specialty. It’s an area that is confused at this point. We think Jade that we are going to have – we have the capital and we are going to have the opportunity to invest a lot more capital at very attractive returns as risk retention sorts itself out.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. That was great color. And then just switching gears to the multifamily front, can you provide a quick overview of the pipeline of that business in terms of the geographic focus and perhaps what other markets you view as attractive for that product over the next few years?
Bruce Gross: As Rick gathers a paper or two to answer that question, let me just say that there is a lot of discussion about some overheated rental markets and there are some particularly in some of the core city centric markets. Those generally have not been the areas where we have focused our attention. And the broader markets that really require kind of the bread and butter rental communities are healthy, vibrant and where we focused our attention. So Rick, go ahead.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, we are really spread across nationally amongst 22 to 25 metropolitan areas, some suburban, some mini urban, all transit-oriented and in markets that are really high growth, low vacancy. And I can – we can give you a list of or you can go to the website and see all of the places that we have got communities going and then that will give you a good sense of where we are looking.
Jeff Krasnoff: It’s very similar to our for-sale footprint with few exceptions.
Stuart Miller: Right. Think about that the for-sale footprint as kind of being the roadmap. We don’t deploy our for-sale personnel in the rental effort. So, it is separate management groups, but they do feed off of each other in terms of market intelligence and general market data. So, we benefit by being coexistent in those markets, but we are not interdependent. And those markets that we have chosen as being best in the country to deploy our for-sale business work just as well on the rental basis.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Stuart Miller: Alright. Thank you everyone for joining our third quarter update. Look forward to updating at year end. Have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Thank you. I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great, thank you. And thank you, David. And I want to say thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; and Dianne Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto, are here as well, as well as some other members of our management team. Some of them will be joining in on our conversation during the Q&A period. I'm going to briefly give some remarks, as I've always done, about the business in general, and then Bruce is going to jump in, break down our financial detail and give some further guidance for next year, and then as always, we will open up to Q&A. We would like to request, as we always do, that during the Q&A period each of our participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin and say that our second quarter 2016 results reflect another quarter of strong operating results for our company. We've continued to benefit from a slow and steady housing market recovery that has continued to define the US housing market environment, and we've crafted specific strategies within our company for our business that have positioned us well to maximize the opportunity in these market conditions. As we've noted consistently over the past years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit that has continued to grow over the past years. While questions have been raised as to the real, normalized levels of production that are required to serve the US current population, we believe that production levels in the 1 million to 1.2 million starts per year range are still too low for the needs of American household growth that is now normalizing. While measuring current production levels against historical norms of 1.5 million starts per year might be flawed logic, as there may be a new normal, we believe that the very low inventory levels in existing and new homes and the low vacancy rates and high and growing rental rates for apartments indicate that we are in short supply nationally. With that said, it's important to note that the housing market is not really a national market. Instead, it's a large number of very local markets, each with different dynamics that are averaged together to generate some sometimes quirky results. With that said, we believe that there continues to be a growing pent-up demand for dwellings of all types across the country, though stronger in some markets than others, and this demand will continue to propel a continued long cycle, slow and steady market improvement. While demand has been constrained by limited access to mortgages, stronger general economic conditions including lower unemployment, modest wage growth, and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We expect that demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years and that will drive increased production as the deficit and housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to constrain that demand. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in a slow and steady positive homebuilding market and will enable slow, steady though sometimes erratic growth throughout the industry. This has been our consistent guiding theme over the past years, and we have mapped our strategy around this view. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of these segments. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the early part of this year, we have remained resolute in our view that have generated our strategies. Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for sale homebuilding operations experienced a healthy spring selling season with a sales pace of 3.9 sales per month per community. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market as our new home orders increased 10% year-over-year, while community count grew 4%, and our average sales price grew 4% to $362,000. Even while continued labor shortages, and land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximized margins, and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain a strong net operating margin, which came in at 13.9%. As we've noted in past conference calls, we have adjusted our for-sale housing strategy as the recovery has matured and land pricing has adjusted to that recovery. There are three components of our core homebuilding segment strategy. They are soft pivot, slower growth, and focus on SG&A. To begin, we've talked consistently about our soft pivot land strategy over the past years, away from the land-heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery, and we are now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter, two to three year average life. Our more recent quarterly reports have demonstrated that we've moderated our land spend as a percent of homebuilding revenues, and this has and will continue to be a core strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales. Second, we've noted in past quarter conference calls that given our now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage and limit our growth in order to grow the bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We have moderated our top line growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 7% to 10% range as we've redirected our management efforts towards maximizing our net operating margin. Third, with less pressure on the top line growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving faster bottom line growth and cash flow by maximizing pricing power and using innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. Under the company mantra of What We Can Measure, We Can Change, we are focused on changing and improving all elements of our operation. As an example, last quarter, we highlighted that we've been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We've been moving our advertising and marketing spend away from conventional marketing, like newspaper and billboard advertising, to a purely digital platform. In the current quarter’s results, we're continuing to see the benefit of this management focus as a significant portion of our SG&A reduction can be attributed to this initiative. It is noteworthy that this quarter's SG&A of 9.3% is the lowest second quarter SG&A in our company's history. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight, and constrained mortgage availability, we believe that our three-pronged strategy for our homebuilding segment positions us well for the slow but steady growth environment. We feel that we can run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate, with strong bottom line profitability and cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for sale homebuilding segment. Moving on, our financial services group has had an outstanding second quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we've also benefited from a strong though sometimes erratic refi market, as well as from the expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These side car opportunities are continuing to expand as we move through 2016. Our strategy for the future of Lennar Financial Services continues to be to continue to construct and maintain a fully self sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. Next, our multi-family program continues to develop as a leading blue chip developer of apartment communities across the country. The second quarter has continued an outstanding run for LMC, Lennar Multifamily Communities, which continues to complement our for sale homebuilding operations. Since household formation has recovered as a slower rate than expected and many new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase, we have focused on building well-located rental communities to address this market opportunity. First time home purchasers have come back to the market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first-time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has targeted the rental market as well. As we've continued to expand our national footprint, we've matured and evolved from a merchant build program which was designed to prove our base concept. This beginning phase worked extremely well, as we have proven our ability to purchase, design, build, stabilize and sell a number of our communities at a growing level of profitability. Having proven the concept, we have now built or added a build to core platform. This platform enables us to build and retain our outstanding pipeline of properties and benefit from long-term ownership. We have now raised $2 billion for our build-to-core platform which will become a long term cash flow producing, fee generating, value creation machine. And while multifamily production has generally normalized, more rental product is going to continue to be needed and we are very well positioned to continue to be careful in site selection while we fill this need and grow our multifamily platform. Our now almost $7 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at very low levels. Next, our Rialto segment continued to see challenges of the second quarter. While our Rialto segment continued to see challenges in the second quarter, we continued to see opportunity rising in our Asset Management business, as we get closer to realizing the embedded value of our promote from our Rialto fund investments. We expect to begin to report our promote in the first half of 2017. Additionally, on a current basis, our Fund and Asset Management business showed improved profitability over last year's second quarter and we expect this trend to continue. Unfortunately, volatility within the capital markets in the first quarter continued to pressure volumes and pricing on new issue commercial mortgage-backed securities into the second quarter and that continued to negatively impact our mortgage finance business. Nevertheless, while Rialto Mortgage Finance was less of a contributor in the current period than in past quarters, we have been seeing sequential improvements in both volumes and margins for RMF and the capital markets have generally healed and we expect improvement in contributions in the second half of the year. Rialto also suffered a one-time write-off, resulting from a discrete single asset from a bulk legacy acquisition in 2010. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across all real estate and financial products and allows us to capitalize on both short term and long-term duration opportunities throughout the economic cycles. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year and the one-time write-off from a single asset negatively impacted year-to-date earnings for Rialto, this volatility has also created unique opportunities for new investments in our Asset Management business. The dysfunction in the financial markets along with new risk retention rules and banking regulations will ultimately work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products and we will continue to grow as a best-in-class asset manager. Finally, as we noted in our press release, we've successfully completed an important step in the evolution of FivePoint, our strategic large-scale community builder. We contributed and exchanged our interest in three strategic joint ventures and our interest in the management company for an investment in a newly formed entity called FivePoint Holdings, LLC. This transaction marks the next step in FivePoint's evolution as a strategic developer and manager of large scale master plan communities. It also marks a next step in Lennar's strategic mission to revert to our core homebuilding base. As the recovery matures, FivePoint will operate very independently with a self contained management, led by Emile Haddad. We simply could not be more excited about the prospects for the future of this one of a kind leader in community development. Overall and in conclusion, let me say that we continue to be very pleased to present our second quarter results and our overall progress this morning. We feel very confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked very well to position us for continued performance and future growth. And as I've said many times before, we are extremely confident that we have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. Now let me turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart. And good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $218 million, which is a 19% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 17% in the second quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries, and a 4% year-over-year increase in average selling price to 362,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.1%, which was in line with our stated goals. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 23.8%. The gross margin decline year-over-year was due primarily to increased land costs. Sales incentives continued to decline as this quarter was 5.7% versus 5.8% in the prior year. Gross margin percents were once again, highest in the east and west regions. Direct construction cost increases have moderated compared to the prior year. These costs were up 2% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot, driven entirely by labor and offset by a slight decrease in material costs. As Stuart highlighted, we were successful in improving our SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and we continued to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. As a result, operating margins improved year over year by 10 basis points. Equity and loss from unconsolidated subs was $9.6 million in the second quarter compared to equity in the earnings of $6.5 million in the prior year. The loss was primarily attributable to the company's share of costs associated with establishing the new FivePoint entity, partially offset by $6.7 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities, primarily due to the sale of home sites to third parties. Other income was $14.9 million, primarily due to a profit participation from one of our joint ventures and there is a partial offset of $7 million in the non-controlling interest line. We opened 88 new communities to end the quarter with 692 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 11% for the quarter. The cancellation rate decreased to 14% in the second quarter from 15% in the prior year. In the second quarter, we purchased 5,300 home sites, totaling $437 million versus $445 million in the prior year's quarter. These numbers align with our soft pivot strategy, where we are focused on buying shorter duration land. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 166,000 home sites, of which 131,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of 1 to 2 per community. Turning to financial services, this business segment had strong results this quarter, with operating earnings of $44.1 million compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to $36.8 million from $33.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations were flat with the prior year at $2.4 billion. The improved earnings is driven by an increased profit per loan due to the favorable interest rate environment. Refinance volume for the company decreased to 12% of total originations from 19% in the prior year, bringing this quarter's purchase origination volume to 88% of total originations. The capture rate of Lennar home buyers improved to 83% this quarter from 82% in the prior year. Our title companies' profit also increased growing to $7.4 million in the quarter from $5.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher profit per transaction versus prior year. Turning to Rialto, this segment produced an operating loss of $13.8 million compared to operating earnings of $7.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The Investment Management business contributed $26.1 million of earnings, which includes $6.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds, and $19.2 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds 1 and 2 now totals $138 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $386 million of commercial loans into 3 securitizations, resulting in earnings of $12.7 million, compared with $721 million and $29 million in the prior year respectively, and these are before their G&A expenses. As mentioned previously, the volume decrease was due to the disruption in the CMBS capital markets earlier this year and it has taken some time for the new loan market to ramp back up. Our direct investments had a loss of $21 million, this included a $16 million write-off of uncollectible receivables at a hospital acquired through the foreclosure of the distressed loan from a 2010 bank portfolio acquisition. A third-party management company operates this hospital. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $24.9 million for the quarter and interest expense was $6.7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $104 million of cash. The multifamily segment delivered a $14.9 million operating profit in the quarter, primarily driven by the segment's $15.4 million share of the gain from the sale of an operating property and a $5.2 million gain on a third-party land sale, as well as management fee income partially offset by G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with 8 completed and operating properties, and 32 under construction, 5 of which are in lease-up, totaling over 9,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $7 billion and over 25,000 apartments. Our tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. The lower rate is a result of our continuing efforts to maximize the new Home Energy Efficiency Credit, which was again extended into 2016. The tax rate for future quarters should be approximately 34%, although we will continue to focus on trying to maximize this available energy credit. Turning to the balance sheet. Liquidity remains strong with approximately $600 million of homebuilding cash and $375 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 390 basis points year over year, as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 43.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 19% to $6.1 billion and our book value per share increased to $27.92 per share. In March, we issued $500 million of five-year senior notes at 4.75%, and in April, we retired our maturing 6.5% senior notes. In May, we converted the remaining $71 million of our 2.75% convertible notes. And in addition, during the quarter, we early converted approximately $68 million of our 3.25% convertible senior notes, with an additional $136 million converted subsequent to quarter end. Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance that we gave at the start of the year, with just a couple of quarterly refinements. First, deliveries. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for all of 2016. The backlog conversion ratio in the second quarter was 88%, which exceeded the previous guidance of 80% to 85%. We capitalized on a healthy spring selling season, and sold and delivered some homes in Q2 that were scheduled for our third quarter. Given that, we now expect our backlog conversion ratio to be around 75% in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is still projected to achieve a backlog conversion of at least 90%. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The gross margin percent will vary between Q3 and Q4 based on our product mix. Q3 is expected to be between 22.5% and 23%, while the fourth quarter is projected to be between 23.5% and 24%. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A in our company's history for the full year with the greatest leverage coming in our fourth quarter. Turning to financial services, we are assuming we will continue to benefit from the extended low interest rate environment and we are increasing our financial services goal to $130 million to $135 million of profit for all of 2016. Turning to Rialto, we are still on track to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016. However, the one-time write-off of the hospital receivables will now bring the range to flat to $5 million of profit for the full year and is still weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter. We are still on track with $50 million to $55 million of profit in the multifamily segment, with the third quarter close to breakeven and strong profits in the fourth quarter. The category of joint ventures, land sales and other income we expect to be flattish for the third quarter, but now expect the fourth quarter to be the highest profit quarter for this category in 2016, with $20 million to $30 million of profit. And finally, our balance sheet is well on its way on its path to lower leverage. The soft pivot strategy, the strong earnings contribution, and the $400 million 3.25% convertible security of which half is already converted through mid-June, should bring us to a net debt to total capital in the 35% to 40% range by year end. This will position us extremely well as we finish out 2016. Let me turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Speakers, our first question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Your line now is open.
Ivy Zelman: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations, guys. Great quarter.
Stuart Miller: Morning.
Ivy Zelman: Stuart or I'm not sure if Rick or Jon are on, but maybe you guys can just give us some perspective on looking at the results fundamentally within the company's framework, the ones that kind of came in lower than you might have expected on sales and where you are exceeding. And differentiating between price point because there is some concern around moderation at the high end whereas the lower price point seems to be very much accelerating, so that's my first. And then I have a follow up? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Okay, good. I'm going to turn it over to Rick and Jon, but I want to correct one thing that I apparently said. Jon is not the Chief Financial Officer of the company. He is the Chief Operating Officer, and I didn't want to dethrone Bruce inadvertently, so let me turn it over to Jon and Rick to give some color on that.
Jon Jaffe: Ivy, its Jon. Overall, we saw strong sales in different markets that tend to cover both starter price points and move up price points. For example, specifically, Northwest was strong across all segments. Southern California was strong, Southeast and Southwest Florida were strong, Charlotte and the Carolinas also strong, and Central Valley, which is a more affordable price point for California. The place that was off the most was Houston. As you would expect, as we continue to see the effects of job loss there, and you see that also with our greatest increase in incentives in Houston, even though for the overall company, we're flat. So if you look at it in big picture, Florida was year-over-year sort of flat for us in absorption pace, California flat, Texas, excluding Houston, was actually improved nicely, and the Carolinas were improved. And clearly we do see some lower demand in the higher price points as compared to lower price points, but generally it's still submarket driven.
Ivy Zelman: Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just secondly, on the respect to the multifamily portfolio and recognizing the strength of what you're seeing, can you talk a little bit about the lease-ups, if they're meeting expectations. There is concern that we've all been talking about on the urban supply and a lot of supply that might be a bit ahead of its skis and how you think about your investment and your growth in that sector in that overall category going forward with respect to the supply dynamics?
Rick Beckwitt: Hi, Ivy. It's Rick. First, I would tell you that we couldn't be, from our standpoint better positioned. You've got to go back in time. We started this program back in 2011 and a lot of the pipeline was secured at points in time where there wasn't a lot of people looking for a land opportunity, and it's coming through our machine right now. We've got key strategies, the merchant built strategy where we're going to sell those assets and generate good and consistent profits for us as a company. And our build-to-core strategy gives us the opportunity to hold on to these assets for a longer period of time because it's in a longer growth vehicle. As you look at the things that we've put under contract, we were very careful in first of all, understanding where the growth in the market was going to be, focusing on vacancy levels, focusing on age of product that was close to our assets. So just like in our homebuilding business, we were very specific on identifying where things were going to come on and compete. And I can tell you, looking across the portfolio we really couldn't be better positioned right now.
Stuart Miller: Let me jump in here, Ivy, and say that, you know, I think that we had at the outset, a strategic advantage. We started with an overlay of homebuilding operations where we had market data and market intelligence. We understood that we were not dealing with a national apartment market or for sale market for that matter, but we were dealing with local markets and each one would have to be regarded carefully and individually. We mapped out our strategy for investment for land acquisition. We were careful to avoid markets that looked like they were becoming oversaturated. I think Rick and Jon and the entire multifamily team did an extraordinary job of finding the opportunities where growth would be consistent and where we would have long dated opportunities for a sustained business. And given the fact that we had a very deep research team already established that had an eye towards not just the rental markets but also the for-sale markets, we think gave us a better window into the market and better strategic positioning. There is a lot of talk about the urban markets being somewhat overbuilt in most of those instances. Those were the markets where we saw the most action and where we didn't get heavily involved or where we did, we got involved very early at very attractive pricing.  So I think that we are starting to hear - everybody is starting to hear that there might be a little bit more heat in some of the rental markets. What I've heard articulated by one of the best and brightest in the rental market is that we're probably coming to the later innings of a double header, the first game of a double header. We might see a little bit of softness for a period of time but it looks like and it feels like absorption is going to outstrip any kind of oversupply in fairly short order and we think that there's a lot of run rate for the multifamily markets, for the rental markets going forward.
Rick Beckwitt: And Ivy, just a last thing on that. If we are in that stage where the market gets a little bit soft and that - what that's going to do is it's going to drive some of the people out of the market and given the fact that we just created this $2 billion venture, it's going to position us to really capitalize on the opportunity as people step away from the market. So we're really excited about where we are.
Ivy Zelman: Well, good luck. Thanks guys.
Stuart Miller: Thank you. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Sir, you line now is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on the, just another type of broader health question on the general markets. Ivy referred to kind of the higher end, but I was hoping to get a little bit more color around what's going on in your California markets and kind of speak to coastal versus inland empire, and you mentioned Central Valley. If we could kind of get a little more in depth look on different trends, different markets and again, maybe speaking to high end versus low end and the foreign buyer, there's always, I think, a good amount of interest in those trends.
Jon Jaffe: Sure, this is Jon again. California, as I said a moment ago, from a sales pace perspective, has remained strong year over year. We see a pace of over five sales per community per month on average. Certainly at the lower price point, it absorbs faster. California, in general though, it's hard to produce homes at the lower price points because not only of land costs but also because of impact fees being as significant as they are. And so that tends to drive particularly, in Southern California, the Bay Area, a higher sales point. And at that higher sales price point, clearly, it's hard to get significant momentum above, I think, the current levels. We are seeing a sustained interest, particularly in the Asian or Chinese buyer. We haven't seen that fall off. So if you look at a place like Irvine, where it's been very significant. We have good data at the Great Park. That's remains very consistent and healthy, same thing in the Bay Area marketplace, so we're seeing consistency there. Bakersfield, probably, is off the most in terms of California markets, it's similar to Houston. It's not as severe to us that was hurt by the pullback in the energy sector which is a lot of the job creation so there's been in Bakersfield, so there's job loss in Bakersfield. Fresno remains healthy, though, from a Central Valley perspective.
Michael Rehaut: Great, Jon. That was really helpful. I appreciate that. And then just secondly, on the second half of the year, obviously, a lot of detailed guidance and really appreciate the help there, but no good deed goes unturned, unpunished so just a little more clarity, if possible. The ASP for the back half of the year, you did 365 in the first quarter, 362 in the second, your average price in backlog is in the high 360. So can we expect something similar to persist into the back half?
Bruce Gross: Mike, this is Bruce. I would say that because the mix of what's in the backlog includes a little bit more of lower priced homes, you are likely to see the average sales price come down into the 350s in the back half of the year.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. Thanks very much, guys.
Bruce Gross: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Susan McClary of UBS. Your line now is open.
Susan McClary: Thank you. Good morning.
Rick Beckwitt: Good morning.
Susan McClary: You obviously have realized a lot of benefits in what you've been doing through your marketing initiatives in the SG&A that we this quarter but looking out from there, how do we think about what the next steps are and what other things could you take advantage of to continue to see improvements in there?
Stuart Miller: Well, the example of migrating from conventional to digital marketing is put forth, simply, as an example. We have initiatives throughout our organization that are designed to use technologies to change the landscape of the way that we're operating our business. Some other examples of that are as simple as in and around technology. We are revamping the entire plumbing system of our technology department to reconfigure in a more efficient manner in the way we input information and ultimately, produce reports for people in the field. That seems kind of simplistic but in a company like ours that has evolved systems over a lot of years, going back and reconfiguring systems with a proper tubing system enables us to reduce the number of applications that we're actually using in the field with multiple points of input to drive efficient export of data to the people that need to use it on a regular basis. It will enable us to be more accurate. It will enable us to be a lot more timely, approaching real time distribution of data over the next year or two. This will - that initiative alone will drive costs down. We view that over the next couple of years, there's a 20 basis point to 50 basis point reduction in SG&A that we'll derive just from that. Now, there might be some intermittent ticks up in cost but primarily, the trend will be down. In our production arena, we are using our technologies to look at the number of models and the efficiency of the plan designs that we're offering our customers in the field. We're looking at technologies to review and to consolidate the view of SKUs that we're offering across our different markets. All of these things we view as opportunities to bring another 10, 20, 50 basis points to either the reduction of SG&A or potentially, the efficiency of our construction efforts.
Susan McClary: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful and then just in terms of the labor side I know that you noted your costs were around about 2%, I think, you said in the quarter. We are hearing that in some areas, perhaps things are getting a bit better there. Can you just give us more detail on what you mean?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. I wouldn't describe conditions as better. What you see is a change as the construction cycle moves into this part of the year, so you see more stress, perhaps in the drywall area today than you did before, and perhaps less stress at the front end, with flats but overall, it remains very constrained. All of the increase for us was in the labor category. In fact, because of the low point of lumber in our deliveries in Q2, actually, material costs were down for us year over year. So still can see pressure in labor and it ties into the point Stuart was making, where we're very focused on doing a better job of our tools communicating with our labor force. So that we could communicate job site readiness and their availability and be better connected with our trade partners.
Susan McClary: Okay. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Next question?
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line now is open.
Michael Eisen: Good morning. This is actually Michael Eisen on for Rob today. Just a quick question for you guys. Looking at some of the trends that I'm seeing quarter-over-quarter on your orders and demand, I was wondering if any of the strength in the central market or slowdown in the west and some other regions is due to a change in community count and footprint as opposed to just organic demand. If you guys could touch on some of the markets that have been outliers for you of either strength or weaknesses, greatly appreciate it?
Jon Jaffe: Well, this is Jon. Again the biggest needle mover was the decline in sales pace in Houston, when you look at the Central. Other markets in the Central, saw an improvement in Phoenix and Dallas has remained very strong and improved year over year in terms of sales pace and the West fluctuates very much based on community openings. So for example, the Bay Area, which remains very strong was down year over year, and that's just based on timing. We went from an absorption of over seven sales per month per community to five. Five is very healthy, but I would just say that's just dependent on timing of communities and very similar throughout the rest of California.
Michael Eisen: So thinking about timing for the remainder of the year, would you expect those trends in California to persist or will additional communities come on to market that will help benefit those rates in the region?
Jon Jaffe: I think, in general, you see as municipalities struggle to deal with the increase in activity, a slowness in bringing communities online so I think you'd expect that trend to continue somewhat.
Michael Eisen: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.
Jon Jaffe: And if you look at Central activity, our sales were up 22% year-over-year for the quarter. We've got some communities that were held back because of weather. It was really wet in parts of the Central US. And so you'll start to see those come on end of this quarter, beginning of next.
Michael Eisen: Very helpful. Thank you guys.
Rick Beckwitt: Welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Lovallo of Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line now is open.
John Lovallo: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my call as well. The first question is on the operating margin outlook to be flat to down 50 basis points year over years. This is despite 20 basis points of improvement in the first quarter and about 10 basis points in the second quarter. I understand that the third quarter gross margin expectations seem to be a bit tempered but it just seems that the leverage that you should get on the higher volume in the back half of the year could be an offset so it just feels like there might be a little conservatism baked in there, can you help me understand that?
Bruce Gross: Yes, John. This is Bruce. As you look at the prior year, we had some pretty strong operating margins, especially in the third quarter as you're looking at year over year and then the fourth quarter. So as you are looking at any change in volume, our third quarter won't have as much increase in volume as our fourth quarter is likely to have year over year, so there's not much leverage there. So we are not trying to be conservative. I think as we've laid out this guidance and updated it from quarter to quarter, this is what we really think is going to come in, so as you do the math with those numbers, I think you'll see us right in that range. There's no conservatism that we're trying to put into the guidance that were given.
John Lovallo: Okay. Thank you, and then the follow-up would be realizing that Houston has still been a challenging market with oil kind of creeping back in that $50 per barrel range, how has the mood been? Are you guys seeing signs that things could be at least, bottoming?
Stuart Miller: Yes, we are seeing signs of that. The biggest issue associated with Houston right now is you're still seeing positive employment growth. The issue is that, that growth is really happening at the lower wage jobs as opposed to the higher wage jobs. Driving that or stemming from that, our lower-priced homes and we have a lot of communities in Houston that are focused on the lower price, are doing extremely well. It's really once you get above that $400,000 price point in the oil corridor, where sales are off and if you were to break out our business between our higher price and our lower price, what's dragging Houston down is the higher price communities. That being said, we've got some core assets that are lowland bases that we are just hanging on and metering out so sales to the buyers that are there. We are seeing in rig counts slow - decline, the decline in rig counts slow down. You're starting to see a little bit more relo activity or talk of relo activity as oil inches back up. As it moves above 50, 55, I think you'll start to see an overall change in temperament throughout the market.
John Lovallo: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.
Stuart Miller: Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line now is open.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a broad strategic question as the Lennar family of companies has expanded. Is there vision for the company to evolve into more of a real estate asset manager, Brookfield type of company or do you see the Company remaining, at its core, a home builder with other but perhaps, fewer related offshoot businesses that you mentioned with FivePoint, the potential for simplification?
Stuart Miller: Yes, our strategy and we've been talking about it for some time now, is with the maturity of the market, we're clearly focused on reverting to our core of what we almost call reverting to pure play. We think that the development of some of these strategic ancillary businesses were very much a part of growing the core out of the downturn and leveraging opportunities that were part of our DNA. But having developed those strategies to elements of maturity, we think that there are opportunities that we have maintained as optional opportunities for those businesses to find better programs for themselves. You see that embedded in the way that FivePoint has been evolving. If you look at the management team of FivePoint, led by Emile Haddad, who we have been working - he's been working within the company for over 20 years. The management team is a self-sufficient, independent, highly confident, industry leading management team that's prepared to operate very independently. And as has been reported, we have been looking at an opportune time to invigorate an IPO. The market doesn't happen to be there but with that said, it's emblematic of the strategies that we've employed. Jeff Krasnoff leads Rialto. Rialto has its self-sufficient team. And of course, as we've talked about quite a lot on this call, our Multifamily Program, LMC, is also led by Todd Farrell, very strong leader with a core management team that it, too, is operating very independently. So while under the Lennar umbrella, we all tend to thrive and work well together and synergistically, the core mission right now is to revert to pure play as a home builder and to, ultimately, over the next years, as opportunities present themselves, find proper homes for those opportunities.
Jade Rahmani: And on the Rialto side, with risk retention quickly approaching on the horizon for the end of this year, are you viewing that as an opportunity and specifically, is there an opportunity to raise funds that would be - are you seeing demand from institutional investors to participate in risk retention funds?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, we've talked about that a number of times and look, Rialto has some of its legacy assets that came about in the beginnings of the recovery are a minor drag to an operation but the big bold opportunity is this blue-chip operating machine that we have built as an asset manager and as a conduit business. That business is really well-crafted to participate in this ultra-regulatory environment that we have run into, where both bank regulation, whether it's Basel III or Dodd-Frank and risk retention rules all kind of migrate business in the direction of the platform that we've built. And over time, Rialto was going to benefit from these things, is well-positioned. The money that we have raised is clearly earmarked for those kinds of things, and it convinces a real confidence in the opportunity set that lies ahead.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: You're welcome. Next question?
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line now is open.
Mike Dahl: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question, just to pick up on some of those FivePoint comments. Just maybe some clarification there. I think the original intent was that this formal combination was conditioned on an actual IPO. So just curious if the overall structure is the same. Your ownership interest is the same as originally contemplated. What's the rationale for going ahead and formerly converting the interests today and then it looked like you recognized some costs alongside that this quarter. So how should we think about any P&L impact over the next couple of quarters related to this?
Stuart Miller: I think in a general sense, the transaction is very similar. As is widely known, the IPO market has been tepid, at best. It's just not the opportune time but the strategy of putting together FivePoint and large-scale communities under one umbrella management team was a strategy that was primary under any circumstances. The contribution that we made basically had a very similar net impact and might be some nuanced differences. And in terms of FivePoint's profitability going forward, I think you'll look to the numbers that come out from FivePoint independently, as it has asserted itself as an independent entity, very much part of our construct. So I think that what you're seeing is very similar to what we articulated as part of an IPO process but just not with the fruition of the IPO process. And the combination that we've engineered in anticipation of something in the future is about creating efficiencies and effectiveness and growing this large-scale blue chip operating platform for large-scale community development.
Mike Dahl: Okay. Thanks for that, Stuart. And then second question, just going back to some of the margin guidance and so I understand the operating margin is flat to down 50 basis points. If I look at the gross margin guidance specifically and look at midpoints and combine with some of the backlog conversion numbers, it looks like the guide is effectively towards the lower end of the 23 to 24 for gross margins. And again, I understand there's some offsets on the better SG&A control. But just curious, what are - what's driving that difference in - or driving you towards the lower end of the gross margin guide compared to three or six months ago?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, I think that what we've articulated is a slow and steady growth recovery environment that has defined housing but a lot of choppiness along the way. And I guess if there's a representation of the choppiness we're talking about, it's the way that the first quarter evolved, kind of as a surprise to everyone. Fed raised interest rates, starting January 1 right out of the chutes at the beginning of the year, the capital markets tanked and it created some lack of confidence in the consumer. I think generally speaking, you can't time where the choppiness actually exists. And so we left a fairly wide range as we gave guidance at the beginning of the year. We're probably trending to the lower parts of that range but I think it derives from the choppiness that's embedded in the system and the way that the years started out. And so at the end of the day, I think this is well within kind of the range that we've articulated. I don't think it should be of any concern that we're trending towards the lower part of that range. In fact, it's exactly why we gave the range that we did, recognizing that there's some tugs and pulls to the downside as well as the upside. But we still believe very strongly that the trend is upward.
Mike Dahl: Great. And is this, I guess if we're looking out to next quarter, is this something where this is just a lack of pricing power that you would have anticipated or will we actually see incentives tick up in what's delivered over the next two quarters?
Rick Beckwitt: I think it's a - this is Rick. It's a combination of several factors, choppiness, as Stuart said. We are seeing some labor price increases out in the field and that's flowing through our product. Certainly, the building material manufacturers are trying to get more for their product as well. That, combined with a slowing of sales price increases, has caused our margins to compress a little bit. As you step back from that, I'd say that there's still very healthy margins. We're very much focused on operating margin and if we can get some incremental deliveries, you'll see the play on operating margin and that's really how we're operating the company. We are - we continue to benefit from some land assets that we bought in prior years, but when we're replacing those land assets and a little bit higher land cost basis running through so it's a combination of all those things that has an impact on gross margin.
Stuart Miller: Let me just, in this context, remind one thing that I said in the early - in my initial remarks and that is, we tend to look at national numbers, even the roll up of Lennar's numbers are a national roll-up across the country. We're actually dealing with a lot of very, very different markets that roll up and sometimes give some kind of quirky roll up results. And so each market is operating very independently, is finding that the volatility in its unique market can sometimes relate to jobs, can sometimes relate to macro environment, can sometimes relate to the international environment. So you are seeing a roll up of all of those trends. So let's not forget that these are a lot of local markets that are operating very independently.
Mike Dahl: Right. Always a good reminder and thanks for the color.
Rick Beckwitt: You bet. Let's take the last question.
Operator: Thank you. The last question comes from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.
Tim Daley: Thanks for taking my call. This is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Good morning.
Tim Daley: My first question is kind of touching back with what Ivy was discussing in the multi-family business. So I noticed that you mentioned that you kind of started the multi-family business by gathering market data and the marketing intelligence that you had via the single family operations. Does that mean you're traditionally targeting the same markets in multifamily as currently operating out of single family? And how does this dynamic interact if that's the case?
Stuart Miller: No, I wouldn't think of it exactly that way. Although, that is - we are all targeting the same basic buyer. It just kind of depends on what the appetite of the buyer is at a moment in time. But I think that what we were articulating is that our keen understanding of each local market gave us an advantage as a new entrant to understanding where the demand actually lay and what the opportunity set was. It also gave us a very sensitive group of tentacles in the market as to where activity was evolving. So it enabled us to avoid the markets that were perhaps getting a little bit too hot while gearing towards the markets that had the most, the deepest set of opportunities. So I would say that the multifamily group has interacted very symbiotically with the for sale group and it's really worked to our benefit in developing a long-term strategy.
Rick Beckwitt: Let me just add a little more color on that. If you look at the first time buyer, they are generally focused on, because of affordability, suburban type opportunities that require a little bit longer commute for them to get to where their work center is. In our multifamily operation, what we focused on is very transit-oriented locations, suburban-urban, a little bit urban, very location specific for folks that can't or may choose not to buy, but want to rent and they want to be in a live, work, play type of environment so we've really got two discrete strategies going on right now to capture that person that's in that first-time buyer world.
Tim Daley: Understood. Great. And then just a follow-up on that, if you do just obviously a little higher level, but if you overlap in some of these markets, which I assume you kind of do, how do you see the ability to price rent versus the ability to price the single family to buy homes?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, let's remember that we are always competing as a for sale home builder against the rental markets and perhaps more importantly, against the existing home markets. So we've been pricing against rental rates for decades and the fact that we happen to be producing some of those rental communities in our markets is incidental. The fact is in none of our markets are we a dominant factor. To the contrary, we might have a community or two in any of the markets in which we operate in and our homebuilding operation and pricing per se operates very independently from the way that we're pricing rental rates. I would say to steer clear of viewing those two - any kind of relationship in rental rates and for sale pricing as interdependent as it relates to our management team pricing either one.
Tim Daley: All right. Great. Thank you for the color.
Stuart Miller: Okay, great. Well, listen, thank you everybody for joining today, couldn't be happier to present our results. We think we're on a good track and look forward to reconvening to report our third quarter earnings.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may now begin.
Stuart Miller: All right. Very good. Thank you, David, and thanks everyone for joining us for our first quarter 2016 conference call. This morning I’m joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto are here as well along with a few other members of our management team. And Jon Jaffe, is joining by phone from California. Some of this group will join for our Q&A period. I’m going to give some brief remarks to begin about the business, Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial picture. And then as always we’re going to open up to Q&A. And as we have in the past, we’d like to request that each person limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. So let me begin and let me begin by saying that our first quarter 2016 marks the beginning of yet another year of strong operating results for the company. Even while the month of December was defined by the first interest rate hike by the Fed since the great recession, which turned into capital market turbulence and fears of recession as we entered calendar 2016. We have seen only mild negative impacts to our business and have continued to be able to perform, as expected. The management teams across our platform has – have recognized the challenges of these sometimes complicated market conditions and have adjusted strategies to meet those challenges and have often turned them into unique opportunities. Each segment of our company has positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond, and we believe that we remain very well positioned to execute our operating plans and strategies in each of those segments. In light of the FED’s move in interest rates early in this quarter and the turbulent market conditions that followed, let me speak briefly about our outlook for the housing market in general. There have been some questions raised about the relationship between housing and interest rates, about the possibility of recession, about consumer confidence in a globally terror-stricken world, and about the implications of a God-awful election season in the United States. In times like these, it’s probably best to put the blinders on and focus on the road ahead, because it seems almost impossible to avoid the distractions of the environment around. To answer the questions directly, we feel certain that modest moves in interest rates tied to low unemployment and some wage growth will be a net positive for housing. We do not see the telltale signs of recession. Global terror seems to highlight that the U.S. is the safest place to be and to invest in the world and teach U.S. citizens focused right here at home. And that’s for the election. Well, they say that America always gets to the right answer right after we’ve tried all the wrong ones, we’ll see. As we’ve noted consistently over the past few years, the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit, and this is resulted in a growing pent-up demand. Stronger general economic conditions, including lower unemployment, modest wage growth, and general consumer confidence are still driving consumers to form new households and to rent and to purchase apartments and homes. We expect the demand will continue to build and come to the market over the next years, and will drive increased production at the deficit and housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. Land and labor shortages will continue to constrain supply and constrain the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market will continue to constrain purchaser’s access to mortgages. These conditions will continue to result in slow and steady positive homebuilding market conditions and will enable slow, steady, though sometimes erratic growth across our platforms. This has been our consistent guiding themes for the past years and we’ve mapped our strategy around this view. Even with the somewhat erratic conditions that defined the first quarter, we’ve remained resolute in our view and have it here to our strategies. Against this backdrop, let me briefly discuss each of our operating segments. Our for sales Homebuilding operations have performed extremely well in the first quarter. Our results reflect slow, but steady growth in the over homebuilding market, as our new orders increased 10% year-over-year. Even while continued labor shortages in land and construction cost increases have tested our ability to match sales and delivery pace, our management team has carefully managed sales prices, maximize margin, and focused on reducing SG&A to offset and maintain strong net operating margins. We have noted in the past quarter conference calls that given the now mature recovery, we have been and continue to carefully manage our growth in order to grow our bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. We’ve moderated our growth targets to achieve a growth rate in the 8% to 10% range, as we’ve redirected our management efforts towards creating operating efficiencies and leveraging SG&A. We’ve also talked consistently about a soft pivot in our land strategy away from the land heavy acquisition strategy in the early stages of the recovery. And we are now targeting land acquisitions with a shorter two to three-year average life. Generally, we’ve moderated our land spend as a percent of revenues, and this will be reflected in future quarters. This has been and will continue to be the strategy driving our homebuilding platform as we manage land acquisitions to taper the growth rate in both community count and home sales. With less pressure on growth rate, we can intensify management focus on driving bottom line growth, cash flow, and maximizing pricing power, while using innovative strategies to drive SG&A down. Under a company mantra of what we can manage, we can change. We are focused on changing and improving quite a lot in operations. As one example of this focus, we’ve been working on reducing customer acquisition costs. We’ve been moving our spend away from conventional marketing and advertising to a digital platform. We’ve learned that digital advertising can be much more targeted and much less expensive. We believe that once fully implemented, we will see up to a 50 basis point reduction in SG&A, while driving an increase in qualified traffic. In the current quarter, we’re already starting to see results from this initiative. With demand growing steadily, land limited labor type and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we’re in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and strong cash flow by measuring and changing our way to greater efficiency and performance in our core for sale Homebuilding segment. Next our financial services group has had an outstanding first quarter as well. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core homebuilding business, we’ve also benefited historically from a strong though sometimes erratic refi market, as well as from expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage and title platforms. These sidecar opportunities will continue to expand in 2016. Our strategy for the future for Lennar Financial Services continues to be to construct and maintain a fully self-sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar Homebuilding business, but drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross oversees this operation and we’ll discuss it further in his comments. The first quarter has continued to display our outstanding positioning for LMC, Lennar multifamily communities as well. We closed one property in the quarter and continue to develop our extensive over $6.5 billion pipeline of quality properties across the country. Our multifamily program continues to complements our for sale operation. Since household formation has recovered at a slower rate than expected, a new households have been more inclined to rent than purchase. We address these markets with rental communities that are desired or can be afforded. First time home purchasers have come back to the housing market more slowly than they have historically and more slowly than expected. While approximately 30% of our for sale homebuilding business continues to be geared to first time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been named primarily at the rental market. We’ve continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build to own program. In the first quarter, we got equity commitments for an additional $300 million for our Lennar multifamily venture to bring our raise to just over $1.4 billion. Our apartment strategy is proving to be very well-timed, as rental rates continue to climb and vacancies are at historic lows. More rental product is going to continue to be needed and we are well-positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our multifamily platform. Also in the first quarter, our Rialto segment saw both challenges and opportunity. While the collapse of the capital markets in the beginning of the calendar year negatively impacted current quarter earnings for Rialto, the volatility did create unique opportunities for investment for the future. During the quarter, volatility within the capital market pressured the pricing on a variety of fixed income products, including new issued commercial mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly, Rialto mortgage finance, RMF saw its net spread dwindled to unusually low levels, while volume dropped as well. Although profit expectations were mess, excellent management kept us in the black in the stress market and Rialto was able to make strategic purchases of CMBS B-pieces at advantage prices for future profitability. Overall, our Rialto platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration of this economic recovery. The dysfunction in the financial markets along with new risk retention rules will ultimately work to benefit – to the benefit of Rialto’s core competence in CMBS and financial products and will continue to grow as a best-in-class manager. Finally, let me mention briefly, our FivePoint properties strategic investment and its management team, which positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted in our last conference call, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering. Of course, the difficult market conditions of the first quarter have kept to some sidelines, but we’ll keep you posted as further information becomes available. In conclusion, let me say that, we’re very pleased to prevent – to present our first quarter results this morning. We feel confident that our view of the market and the strategies that define our business segments have worked well to position us for continued performance and for future growth. As I said in the past many times, we’re very confident that we at Lennar have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter were $144 million, which is a 25% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 25% in the first quarter, driven by a 12% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 12% increase in average selling price to $365,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 22.7%, which was in line with our expectations. The prior year’s gross margin percentage was 23.1%, the decline year-over-year was due primarily to increase land costs. Sales incentives as a percent of home sales revenue continue to decline as this quarter was 5.6% versus 6.3% in the prior year. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East and West regions. Direct construction costs for our single-family detached homes were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $53 per square foot and that was driven primarily by labor increases. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of home sales revenue improved 60 basis points to 10.8% in the first quarter. We were successful in improving SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing homebuilding divisions and additionally we continue to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. This resulted in the lowest first quarter SG&A percentage in our history. Operating margins on home sales also improved and this was improved by 20 basis points to a 11.9% in the first quarter. This quarter, we opened 62 new communities to end the quarter with 684 net active communities. New home orders increased 10% and new order dollar value increased 15% for the quarter. Our sales pace was slightly higher compared to the prior year at 2.9 sales per community per month versus 2.8 in the prior year. The cancellation rate decreased to 15% in the first quarter from 16% in the prior year. In the first quarter, we purchased 10,300 home sites totaling $537 million versus $421 million in the prior year’s quarter. We continue to focus on our soft-pivot land strategy. However, our land spend in 2016 is weighted more heavily to the first-half of the year. Our home sites owned and controlled now totaled 168,000 home sites of which 132,000 are owned and 36,000 are controlled. We continue to carefully manage inventory as our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,200 homes, which is in our normal range of one to two per community. Our Financial Services business segment had strong results with operating earnings of $14.9 million, and that compared to $15.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income decreased to $13 million from $14 million in the prior year. And mortgage originations increased 2% to $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion in the prior year. Refinance volume decreased 47% year-over-year, which created a more competitive market for the remaining purchase business. We did, however, increased our purchase origination volume by 17%, as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and expanded retail presence. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improves to 82% this quarter from 79% in the prior year. Our title company’s profit decreased slightly to $2 million in the quarter from $2.1 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower volume versus last year. Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of $1.9 million compared to $4.6 million in the prior year, both amounts are net of noncontrolling interests. The investment management business contributed $23.2 million of earnings, which includes $1.5 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto real estate funds one and two combined now totaled $136 million. Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $380 million of commercial loans into two securitizations with an average margin of 1.6%, totaling earnings of $3.9 million for the quarter, and that was before their G&A expenses. Our direct investments had earnings of $1.8 million and Rialto’s G&A and other expenses were $20 million for the quarter and interest expense was about $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with $112 million of cash. The Multifamily segment delivered a $12.2 million operating profit in the first quarter, primarily driven by the segment’s $20.4 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property, as well as management fee income, partially offset by G&A expenses. The apartment community sale this quarter was in Mountain View, California and was sold to a firm providing corporate housing for companies, including Google and Facebook. This will be the most profitable apartment community sale this year. We ended the quarter with six completed and operating properties, 28 under construction, five of which are in the lease up, totaling over 8,000 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $2.1 billion. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. The rate was benefited by a favorable settlement with the IRS, as well as the extension of the new home energy efficiency credit. The remaining quarters of the year should have a tax rate of approximately 34%. Our Southeast Florida division has grown successfully and was operating from Vero Beach to Miami. As a result in the first quarter, we split the division into two operating divisions to maximize operational efficiencies. The Southeast Florida segment no longer meets the reportable segment criteria and is now part of the homebuilding East segment. Turning to the balance sheet, liquidity remains strong with approximately $511 million of homebuilding cash and $500 million of borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 240 basis points year-over-year, as our homebuilding net debt to total capital was reduced to 45.3%. We grew stockholders equity by 18% to $5.8 billion, and our book value per share increased to $27.11 per share. During the quarter, we converted $163 million of our 2.75% convertible notes for $163 million of cash and 3.6 million of shares with an average price of approximately $44. At quarter end, the remaining balance to be converted was $71 million. In March, we issued $500 million of five-year senior notes at 4.75%, which will be used for working capital and to retire our $250 million, 6.5% senior notes. This will continue to reduce our borrowing rate, while extending our maturities. Finally, I would like to update our 2016 goals. 2016 homebuilding goals are right on track with the guidance we gave in December with just a couple of quarterly refinements. Deliveries are still on track to be between 26,500 and 27,000 homes. We expect the backlog conversion ratio in a range of 80% to 85% for Q2, 75% to 80% for Q3, and 90% to 95% for Q4. Operating margins are still on track to be flat to down 50 basis points for the entire year. The full-year gross margin is still expected to be in a range of 23% to 24%. The second and third quarter are expected to be at the low end of this range, and the fourth quarter is expected to be at the high-end of the range. We are still on track to achieve the lowest SG&A percentage in our company’s history in 2016 with the greatest leverage coming in our higher delivery quarters in the second-half of the year. Our other company goals are all on track except given the turmoil in the capital markets, we now expect Rialto to earn between $15 million and $20 million for 2016, and that’s weighted more heavily towards the fourth quarter. We’re off to a strong start in 2016. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Robert Wetenhall: Good morning, and congratulations on a really strong quarter. Stuart, just taking from your remarks, I was hoping you could give a little bit more original detail in terms of how the spring selling season has started to unfold. You guys saw tremendous delivery growth in the Central West regions and I was also curious what you are seeing in Houston and how it is compared to prior years?
Stuart Miller: Okay, good, Bob. I’m going to turn it over to Rick and to Jon to give a greater detail on the regions.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I would tell you from a – an overall standpoint, we saw good sequential improvements throughout the quarter, December being the lightest and clearly February being the strongest month, pretty much spread across every operating territory that we’ve got, and I’ll address Houston in a little bit. We saw that with regard to both home sales activity as well as pricing, so we’re optimistic that we’re entering the sale season, although we’re at a very beginning stages, because our quarter ended on – in February. Geographically, we saw – the numbers are pretty similar. Probably our toughest market was Houston, sales were down 3%. But I think we’re outperforming the market there, because on the new home side, as we calculated the market was down about 10% during this comparable period. We saw good pricing power, because we are as Stuart said and Bruce mentioned earlier balancing pace and price there, sales prices were up about 5%. Our margin took it a little bit on the chin, because we’re keeping our inventory active. And we are optimistic that we’re going to pace – starts to deal with the market on the higher price points with lower price points still performing extremely well, but once you get above 350, 400,000, it’s down quite a bit. And we anticipate the numbers that you’ve seen in the magnitude, as I said last quarter around 5%, 6% down for the year is where we think we’re going to end up. But we have tapered back our starts, given some of the weakness on the higher end. Jon, you want to talk about any western markets?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. Bob, as you know California is too big to refer to as one market. So as you look at the segments in Southern California, we’re seeing good strength in Orange County, San Diego, and LA, that’s not only supported by our activity, but when you look at our FivePoint master plan communities at the Great Park you’ve seen that same seasonality Rick described, but selling at almost four sales per month per community for the builders at the Great Park. At Valencia, we’re seeing over three sales per month per community. So it shows very good activity in those markets. Northern California, the Bay Area remains very strong, really defined by a shortage of both housing and particularly in Silicon Valley by a shortage of skilled labor in the tech and biotech world. So that continues to feel demand there. And then in Sacramento, we’ve seen a nice recovery where that’s become a strong market. Inland Empire, Central Valley, I described more stable, good markets, healthy, not as robust as Northern and Southern California. And then across the rest of the West, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, all very stable markets. And then the Pacific Northwest, we can see continued good strength up there again defined by a very strong job demand and very short supply of housing.
Rick Beckwitt: And then if you look at the other big markets we had, Bob, Florida was clearly a – we’re seeing strength there, and the other markets in Texas were up pretty big deal. So in our largest areas, California, Florida, and Texas were doing extremely well.
Robert Wetenhall: That’s a great summary. Thank you. Wanted to ask and maybe this is for Bruce to address. Your gross margin guidance 23 to 24 reciting some pressure there from land and labor costs, at the same time, you’re making very, very big strides in managing SG&A. Stuart said you’re managing what you can measure. And I’m not really asking about 2016, but as a company when you’re thinking about net margin and profit – profitability going forward in 2017 and 2018, are you thinking that like a 20% plus, or 22% gross margin is sustainable, given current pricing trends in land costs, and how much more opportunity do you have to leverage SG&A? Thanks very much. Good luck.
Rick Beckwitt: So, Bob, this is Rick. I’ll take the margin side of that for the next couple of years. Clearly, we’re continuing to benefit from some of the land that we purchased in the last cycle, going back to 2009, and some of the land that we’re continuing to close, I was put under contract a couple of years back. As we move later in the cycle, it’s going to be more difficult to keep the margins up where they are now. But we are underwriting deals today north of 20% across the Board and we’re being relatively conservative with regard to pricing. So as we look at it, the company has historically done – produced a margin that’s north of 20%. And it’s the balance of fine finished home sites on a retail basis and doing some pivot and doing some land development, where you’ve got some wholesale purchasing.
Bruce Gross: And one thing to consider is, we’re focused on two things. We’ve got a race car that’s on the racetrack that is moving through year-after-year, we’re buying land and we’re selling homes. And at the same time off the track, we are refining the engine and we’re tuning it up. What we can measure, we can change is a major focus off the track. We are looking at refining various component parts of our business, I’ve given one example, we have others in our pipeline. And we think that the opportunity to refine SG&A is more significant than what we’ve outlined, but we don’t want to set out pipe dreams that have not been proven yet. So we’re trying to give examples, as we undertake them. But we think that there can be a lot of refinement in SG&A, as we go forward. We’re pretty optimistic about where our net operating margins are going to hold steady.
Robert Wetenhall: Got it. Thanks very much. Good luck.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me?
Stuart Miller: Yes, we hear you.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Yes, sorry about that. Yes, so good quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about your land spend. I think you gave a figure of $537 million. I think that was – was that just acquisition, and if so, can we get sort of the break out of acquisition and development in the quarter?
Stuart Miller: Sure, Steve. The $537 million was just the acquisition. The land development spend was $271 million, and that’s down about $20 million from last year’s first quarter.
Stephen Kim: Got it. And that rate of land spend, do you feel like there was anything in that number, which was a little elevated relative to your expectations going forward over the remainder of the year?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, Steve, it’s Rick. As I said earlier on the markets, we closed on – probably half of the land that we acquired in the quarter was in Florida. Deals that we’ve been working on for really past a couple of years that just came to fruition now, really excited about the positioning that we acquired. And I think you’ll see as we move through the year, the land spend sot of taper down.
Stephen Kim: Okay, great. That’s very helpful. Next question was just about Next Gen. Can you give us a sense for roughly how much of your sales are utilizing that sort of a multi-generation, or a multi-generation type floor plan? And just in general, how have you seen that portion of your product array performing?
Jon Jaffe: Hey, Steve, it’s Jon. For us we’re seeing over 5% of our net sales is coming from our Next Gen platform. We continue to roll it out across more and more of our markets. A good example of that is recently a bigger push in Texas, where we’re seeing a very good receptance of the product as we bring it to market there, continues to sell very strong in some of our markets where affordability is more of a pressure like Arizona, Inland Empire, Central Valley, we see tremendous demand in those markets, Florida, as an example sees very strong demand. So we’re very bullish on the product. Similar to Stuart’s comments, we continue to refine and learn as we go and make sure that we are tweaking that product to meet what we’re hearing back from consumer demand side.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Ivy Zelman: Good morning and congratulations guys, nice quarter. Stuart, you talk a lot about – well, not a lot, but you spoke about digital marketing and appreciation of the opportunity to leverage SG&A. I guess, did you can may be expand on the marketing in absolute dollars and what you think what will drive this internally, is there collaboration, people understand, and maybe you could give us some examples, because I think the word digital marketing, I think, we kind of get it, but maybe you expand on that please?
Stuart Miller: So, look, we’ve focused on the broader concept of customer acquisition costs and that cost is about 10% of our SG&A. There is a large opportunity to reduce that cost. The first part of that is the migration from conventional to digital marketing. If you think about it, conventional marketing is going to a newspaper ad and basically shot gunning across the white population, a message that might or might not resonate with that population. Using an example, we think first time homebuyers as most likely to decide to purchase a home when they’re getting married or one they’re having children. In a digital platform, we can target our message to people who are looking for wedding dresses or purchasing cribs, that’s a more targeted focused audience and it costs a lot less to target that group. Digital marketing enables a greater penetration to the people that we want to hear our message, less scattered delivery of our message at a much, much lower cost. That’s been driving our marketing and advertising costs down and we’re at the front end of that. There are other benefits that will flow from that as we become more proficient at that form of marketing. And I think that our industry and our company are the front end of really redefining what that cost structure can look like.
Ivy Zelman: Well, that’s really helpful. I guess, the internal buy in and appreciating all the divisions are they doing it by themselves, or is it coordinated? Can you give people a better understanding how the collaboration works?
Stuart Miller: So changing a group of divisions that operate fairly independently across the country is a little bit complicated. We have – the way that we have kind of focused on rolling out our thinking is, first, we proved concept in one division. We had one division teach a second division to see if the metrics still hold true. And then we basically have used a metric calculation and almost game within the company to create a competition to roll this out across the company. And we’ve seen this program really take hold across our company and start to create a great deal of enthusiasm around not only a focus on migrating from conventional to digital marketing, but really on looking at broader concepts around SG&A as well. So I think we’ve kind of laid what I would call transmission lines throughout the company to really foster change and roll it out across a broad spectrum.
Ivy Zelman: Sounds great. Well, good luck with that. If I can sneak in another one, you guys had talked a lot about the opportunity to generate consistent cash flow and improving returns over the cycle and just looking at cash flow that you actually had outflows versus generating cash. Can you talk about what we should be expecting with respect to cash flow? And what you think this – the opportunity is on cash flow going forward?
Stuart Miller: Sure. We started talking about ourself pivot and land a couple of years ago. And we started a process think of the homebuilding business more like a cruise ship than a speedboat, there’s a lot of momentum in the direction that we’re headed. It’s hard to turn in short distances. The land acquisition program is that kind of a momentum program. We start negotiating land positions years in advance of actually closing them. Rick has already articulated that our land spend this quarter in large part derived from negotiations and contracts that were entered into two and three years ago. So as we look out towards future quarters, we’re going to see the work the redirection that was put in place two years earlier. So over the next quarters and over the next couple of years, we’ll see our land spend subside as a percentage of total revenues, and we’ll see the impact of that soft pivot. As I articulated, our land today as we focus on land acquisition is generally targeted towards two and three-year duration land purchases. That doesn’t mean where we find a unique opportunity that we won’t buy something larger, we most certainly will, because we’re opportunistic in that way. But it’s going to be priced in a certain way. Generally speaking, you’ll start to see that soft taper be incorporated in the numbers that were reported that’s not the case for this quarter.
Ivy Zelman: Got it. Thank you, and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
Paul Przybylski: Thank you. This is actually Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a little bit more color on your entry-level strategy. I think you said it was 30% of your business this quarter. How did that compare to a year ago and if it’s up, has it had any impact on margins? And then what regions would you be seeing more of a shift entry-level? And then on the Houston side, is there any pressure from the multifamily operators that might put its way through to the entry-level buyer in that market?
Stuart Miller: So first on the trend line for first time buyer, you’re right on 30%. It’s up from about 25% of our mix from the prior year. I think as you start to look at us going forward, you’re going to see in the markets that would include Texas, Carolina, Atlanta, Florida, that those percentages are going to go up as we move through and the balance of this year into 2017, consistent with the land strategy that we articulated going back a couple of years. So on a mix basis, I think, you’ll see probably a 10% to 20% increase in the amount of first time penetration that we’ll do in those specific markets. And as we said before, we’re really not chasing tertiary business on the first time side. These are more infill oriented first time positions and but we’re not going out to what we would normally call the C type markets. Does that answer your question?
Paul Przybylski: Yes, I guess. But and then we have heard some rumors that the apartment operators were starting to give a couple of months rent free in Houston. Has that started to work its way into entry-level demand? I know you said they’re under, I think 250 price point has remained rather strong?
Stuart Miller: We haven’t seen any impact from the multifamily side on the for sale side. But Mark there’s just not a lot of inventory to be had and that benefits us as well as the other builders in the market.
Paul Przybylski: Okay. And then one final question your conversion was a little bit better than we expected. Is that a function of just better weather this quarter, or are we actually start to see true improvement in labor? And if so, do you think that holds going into the second-half of this year, or are we going to still have some kind of hangover like we saw in the second-half of last year?
Stuart Miller: Jon, you might want to comment on the labor picture?
Jon Jaffe: Yes, we’re not really seeing a recovery on the labor picture. I think that we look at it internally from Lennar perspective, or everything is included platform combined with our scale and market share in the markets that we’re in really allow us to manage that very effectively. Everything is included in particular is a very simple program in this environment. It benefits our trades, and it benefits us, particularly as we manage our job side readiness and being prepared for the environment. So that we can manage it on a daily basis by having a simple program. So we’ve seen a very steady environment for us in terms of cycle time, very little increase in cycle time year-over-year. But that doesn’t mean that the labor market is improving any.
Paul Przybylski: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
John Lovallo: Hi, guys, thanks very much for taking my call as well. First question is, you discussed the trend of some first-time buyer shifting towards rental. I’m wondering, if you are seeing any increased demand from other demographics may be on the move down segment?
Stuart Miller: There’s no question that that there has been movement in a number of segments. Clearly, relative to the empty nesters rethinking their living conditions, there has been some movement in the direction of rental versus homeownership there as well. So we’ve seen that the rental option, the reduction in homeownership rate is something that is broader than just affordability, it reflects also appetites and desires that have evolved since the recession. And we think that some of those trends will continue.
John Lovallo: Okay, that’s helpful. And then in terms of the digital marketing strategy, if I heard you correct, I think you guys talked about a 50 basis point potential, it benefits the SG&A over time and maybe even a little bit more. But for the 50 basis point, specifically, did you guys give a timeframe of when you think that’s achievable?
Stuart Miller: I don’t want to get out over my skies and start wrapping timeframes around this. The rollout of a program like this and its adoption is something that gets incorporated, as culture allows change to happen. So we see this as an opportunity, but the 50 basis points is a starting point for us. We think there’s a lot more fuel in that tank around customer acquisition costs, which is a larger broader number in just marketing and advertising. And so I think what I would say at this point to stay tuned, we’ll give further reports on this as it develops. There are other areas of SG&A that we’re also targeting that we think technology, measurement, and focus can bring change in reduction to and I’d say, again, don’t want to get out over our skies that I want to make promises that we can’t live up to. So over the next quarters, we expect to be reporting more on that.
John Lovallo: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Michael Rehaut: First question I had was just in terms of – Stuart, your opening remarks, right at the top you kind of mentioned the Fed rate hike and some of the volatility in the markets during the first couple months of the year and you said since kind of almost for – kind of quote here since the Fed rate hike, you seen only a mild negative impact, struck me is a little surprising giving up the order trends or kind of right in line with our estimates and expect your expectations. What you were referring to exactly when you kind of said mild negative impact? My only thought would be perhaps the reduced profitability of Rialto. But I was wondering, if there’s anything else because obviously sales pace was up a little bit and I believe John also talked about good improvement in order trends throughout the quarter and across all regions. So I was hoping to get a little more granular there?
Stuart Miller: Well, Mike I think that the comment was – what I was trying to get across is, look you saw a shock to the financial system and clearly within the Lennar environment, the biggest shock – a shocking ripple through RMF and the capital markets approach through Rialto. But relative to our company, it was relatively minor in scope. Really homebuilding, if you look at it, step back from it, rode through some pretty tumultuous timing in the first quarter, pretty much unscathed. There might have been some pullback in some consumer confidence and we all that kind of on the edge of our seats waiting to see how the spring selling season might present itself. And I think there was a lot of question as questions about recession in the U.S. economy started to kind of gain steam among economists. So I think that what I was trying to express is that it was a shock to the system. There were some impacts to certain parts of our business though they were minor, the homebuilding side really rode through it intact and there was a little bit of anxiety in terms of anticipation about what might evolve and I still think that people are staying tune, because they don’t think that there’s a complete view that we’re out of the word. So we’re going to have to wait and see what that says and see how markets present themselves. I hope I communicated that all right.
Michael Rehaut: That’s helpful and kind of what I thought, but it’s good to hear you verbalize that for clarity’s sake, particularly on the homebuilding side. Secondly, just kind of looking at big picture and you kind of mentioned the soft dividend and how you’re adjusting as the cycle matures? I was hoping that if you could just kind of revisit capital deployment over the next two to three years in a broader scale, and specifically now that as severe ancillary businesses. I believe are still your capital neutral in terms of the requirements, if not you give me back some capital what that might mean in terms of the other the balance sheet from a leverage standpoint and also any thoughts around share repurchase?
Bruce Gross: So our balance sheet is getting stronger every quarter, we have profitability reflecting on equity or adding to equity. We have in December a convert that is converting that will be in addition to equity – I’m sorry to November, thanks Bruce. Our balance sheet continues to get stronger just by the operation of our business. In terms of cash flow, as noted in an answer to an earlier question, turning the tide on land acquisition and actually turning to that real cash flow program with a lower growth rate and a soft dividend our last strategy will take some quarters still ahead of us. But with our ancillary businesses at least neutral some of them cash flowing positive, apartment still being somewhat of the cash flow negative. We really think as we get into 2017, we have four to five balance sheet, we continue to recast our business with our soft-pivot. I think that we’re going to see the cash starts to come in. It’s most likely to start to reduce our debt dependence and that’s where our focus will be initially. And then ultimately with excess cash from operations, we will start to buy back stock. But that’s not going to happen in 2016.
Michael Rehaut: Okay, no, it’s helpful. And then one last quick one if I could squeeze in technically just a clarification. In terms of the 2016 guidance other than the Rialto adjustment in terms of the expected profits there, the only other thing I was able to gather was that the tax rate is going to come down slightly relative to the first quarter benefit and that impact on the full-year 34 for the next three quarters. But other than Rialto and the tax rate, it did appear that all the other elements of guidance were reiterated, is that correct?
Stuart Miller: That’s correct, Mike. We just had some minor shifts between the quarters, as I gave that detail, but otherwise everything else should be the same for the year.
Michael Rehaut: Right, great. Perfect. Thanks so much.
Stuart Miller: You’re welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Mike Dahl: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start out with the SG&A and maybe take a step back to some of the divisional changes, because it clearly seems that aside from just the efforts to lower customer acquisition costs and transformed digital, you’ve found plenty of other areas to lever SG&A. And then if anything is tracking, at least, at the high-end or even better than the guide for the full year. And so I’m wondering if there are anything anything – any other things like splitting of divisions that we should be thinking about for the next couple quarters that, at least, from a near-term standpoint are creating some additional costs that won’t really be levered until maybe later in the year, or next year, or just how to think about kind of the cadence of the SG&A improvement?
Bruce Gross: Mike, this is Bruce. As you look at the cadence of the SG&A improvement, it’s really coming from two main areas. It’s the focus on digital marketing and it’s the operating leverage, because our additional deliveries are coming out of existing divisions other than the one division split that we mentioned. So as you think about that cadence, we’ll have more homebuilding revenue as you get later in the year, so there will be more leverage later in the year. So that’s the way to think about the cadence. The second part of this year is going to have a bigger improvement in SG&A and that’s driven by the increased volume.
Mike Dahl: Right. I guess on a year-on-year basis and though I guess what I was getting at is, it seems like the current guidance some ways could even be conservative. And just wondering if just given the level of improvement, you’re already seeing and then you will be getting into better leverage quarters and some of these initiatives will be gaining traction. So I guess just wondering how to think about the level of conservatism, or if there are other one-off costs we should be thinking about of why we shouldn’t see the same magnitude of improvement as we go through the year?
Bruce Gross: Well, look, we are investing in technology. So there’s obviously some other costs involved with our focus. But for the most part, you’re looking at similar leverage that you saw in the first quarter and the second-half of the year, as you’re looking year-over-year. And that’s going to be driven by the volume increases. So there isn’t a lot of additional other costs to really think about.
Mike Dahl: Got it, okay. And then just shifting gears to RMF, I guess, Rialto as a whole was a product of the overall Lennar strategy of being very opportunistic at the right points in the cycle, and as you see things changing. And so just curious how you’re – you made some comments about you’re looking at it as you’re now looking at this and some of the challenges in CMBS is being an opportunity. And so it does feel like it’s potentially early on and some disruption in that market. So just wondering if you can give us some sense of just how you are managing to or mitigating some of the near-term risks and balancing that versus potentially looking at some opportunities to expand that part of the business?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So remember that we’ve been in the CMBS markets for a couple of decades now. We’re probably one of the most – we’re probably the most seasoned participant in those markets. We’ve recognized the ebb and flow of demand and supply in CMBS markets. And we recognize we see when the market dries up, sometimes there’s more demand than there is supply and we generally sit on the sidelines as we are right now. At those times, the demand side seem – tends to go away. And as the supply side starts to come back, presents unique opportunities for the participants that are still there to participate. So the way we think about that market is in recognizing that ebb and flow uniquely relative to its market recognizing the dysfunction generally works to our favor, given our experience. I think that the events of the past quarter will tend to drive participants out of that market might sideline the supply side of the market for a period of time, it will ultimately come back and we’ll be well-positioned to be a leader in the market as it reemerges. So that’s kind of the way that we think about it, but our position derives directly from our long-term experience. Jeff, you want to add to that?
Jeff Krasnoff: I would just say just anecdotally on the buy-side in terms of our investment vehicles, we’ve actually, I’d say over the last three or four months have probably been some of the busiest since we’ve been in business just on the buy side just because it’s been such a diminution and demand at the end of the day.
Stuart Miller: And the capital markets ended up taking a lot of the participants out of the market. So there weren’t any buyers there.
Jeff Krasnoff: Exactly. And from the loan origination perspective, which is the other side of business, I mean and again that gives us sort of a leg up on really understanding what’s going on there, there you saw the widening out of spreads. So and we’ll see how that market behaves going forward as the supply and demand ebbs and flows is doing there.
Mike Dahl: All right. Okay, thanks. That’s helpful.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Let’s have one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nishu Sood: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on some of Rick’s comments. Rick mentioned the first-time buyer percentage, which is 30% has been roughly that we could expect to see some improvement, I’m sorry, some gains in that 10% to 20%, I think you said. And that a lot of your investments were in closer in area. So I just wanted to dig into that a little bit. You would think that the opportunity for closer in first-time product would necessarily be limited just because if you have a highly desirable closer in lot, you maximize your returns by putting a more expensive product on it. So just wanted to get a sense of how much growth potential do you see in making these closer investments. What would drive? What would you folks need to see in the market to begin to move out to a more traditional further out, call it, areas that tend to support first-time buyer demand. So just wanted to get a little more details and your thoughts on that, please?
Rick Beckwitt: Okay, so let me just reiterate. In the markets of Texas, Carolina, Atlanta, Florida those areas, we’ve been targeting for the last year. So couple of years to increase our first-time presence by about 10% to 20%. Most of that focus going back a couple of years ago was in securing land positions that were more closer to where people wanted to live in the tertiary areas. And you can do that generally in the markets that we’ve talked about, because there’s still good employment, there’s good transit. As a result of that those positions are going to be higher IRR type of opportunities and lower gross margin opportunities, because you just don’t have the juice in those deals to really get a higher margin. They’re more retail oriented positions that’s not to suggest that we aren’t moving out into a little bit further commute oriented places, but you won’t see us going out – outside of what I would call core markets. Hopefully, that answers your question.
Nishu Sood: Got it.
Stuart Miller: Just to add some clarity was that we don’t see those same opportunity that Rick described and say Texas, Carolina and Florida, so with more traditional markets to say, Central Valley and Phoenix will be more like our company average 30%, 35% affordable, but in your other markets in the west as I went through them earlier, they really isn’t that opportunity, unless you go way out in tertiary markets and we’re just avoiding that and not chasing that business.
Nishu Sood: Got it, that’s helpful. And another question just in terms of the recovery and where we’re at, one of the – in closer in areas that the move-up market, which is Fed most of the recovery so far, there’s been some concerns that with pricing, gains now in their – going to the five year. Some pretty strong pace of games that we had in 12 and 13 in terms of home price, appreciation that affordability is potentially a constraint on – because the housing recovery continuing. They’re closed from a volume perspective, there’s a lot of no room to grow. But what are your broader thoughts on that? And especially if you could give some context from what you’re seeing on the ground in terms of affordability issue.
Stuart Miller: Yes, I think Nishu, that’s a good way to wrap up into – to bring it to an end, bring our call to an end. And in that regard, I think that we continue to see fairly strong demand. I think affordability is a looming question as prices have tended to go up. They tend to go up because the supply, we read about it, see it all the time both on existing homes and new homes just fairly tied and the demand as we emerging. It hasn’t emerged, but it’s still emerging and I think that there is a sizable pent-up demand. Your question about move our purchasers in the market were generally still seeing relative strength across the board from first-time buyers all the way through to move up. There are certain markets that are little bit different. The Houston market as we’ve noted has been softer with higher end, the California markets have remained robust. So it’s not a national picture anymore. We have to look at local markets more directly – but we’re still seeing strength. I think the thing to remember for everyone in the back of your mind is that you have to measure affordability against the alternative and the alternative is what is the rental market look like? What is the rental option and was rental rates moving up and more and more people are thinking to kind of stabilize their outflow of capital, our personal capital into their housing cost like purchasing as opposed to renting because on an annual basis, the rental rates are going up. So that that picture is one that continues to define the housing markets today, a production deficit supply is tight, demand is growing, rental rates are going up and the affordability picture is a bit of a question, but I think in the mix that it probably gives way to a strong consistent slowly growing housing market. And with that, I think we’re going to bring it to close and say thank you all for joining us and we look forward to continuing to report on our progress.
Operator: Thank you, speakers. And that conclude today’s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great, thanks, David and good morning everybody. Just let you know I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto are here with me with a few other members of our management team. John Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer is joining by phone from California. Some of them will join in the conversation for Q&A. Eric Feder is here as well. He might jump. I'm going to give some brief remarks about the business in general and then Bruce is going to jump in and break down our financial details as he has in the past. And then of course we'll open up to Q&A as we always do and request that during Q&A each person limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get as many participants in as possible. So, let me start by saying that our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results just marked another year of outstanding operating results for our company. Every part of the company has performed as expected and positioned itself for continued performance in 2016 and beyond. Management teams across our platform have risen beyond the challenges of sometimes complicated market conditions and have adjusted strategies to meet those challenges. We remain very well positioned to execute our strategically crafted operating plan in what continues to be a very solid macro-environment which is particularly well suited for large well capitalized companies like Lennar. In light of the FED's move in interest rates this week, let me speak briefly about our outlook for the housing market in general. Many have been concerned about the relationship between housing and interest rates. We're quite certain though that modest moves in interest rates in the context of a positive economic environment will be a net positive for housing in general. This has been the case in approximately half of all prior positive interest rate environments. As we've noted before the overall housing market has been generally defined by a rather large production deficit over the past years and this has resulted in a growing pent up demand. Stronger general economic conditions including lower unemployment, sustained wage growth and growing consumer confidence will drive consumers to form new household and to rent and purchase dwelling. We expect that demand will continue to build and to come to the market over the next years as the deficit in housing stock needs to be replenished. While land and labor shortages will somewhat restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, this environment will result in a very steady positive homebuilding market and enable us to grow and expand our platform. Against this backdrop, let me briefly describe and discuss each of our operating segments. Our four sale homebuilding operations have performed extremely well in 2015. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall home building market. While labor shortages and cost increases have tested our ability to max sales and delivery pace, our management team has kept careful control of pace while managing sales prices and margins and reducing SG&A to offset and maintain strong net operating margins. The continuation of the difficult mortgage approval landscape and the introduction of the new TRID rule, also provided some obstacles that our management team navigated seamlessly. We’ve also noted before that given the now mature and restrictive land environment, we’ve been managing and continue to carefully manage our growth in order to maximize our bottom line and to drive strong cash flow. This has been and will continue to be the strategy driving our home building platform as we manage land acquisitions to purchase only the best deals and we continue to maximize pricing power and continue to deploy innovative strategies to drive our SG&A down. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight, and constrained mortgage availability we feel that we’re in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom line profitability and strong cash flow. Our financial services group has had an outstanding 2015 as well. Of course as we’ve continued to grow our core home building business, we also continue to grow and mature our financial services group. While the financial services operations have grown alongside our core home building business, we’ve also benefited from a strong refi market and from an expansion of retail opportunities in both our mortgage entitled platform. These sidecar opportunities will continue to expand into 2016 as the refi business dissipates in its ordinary course. Our strategy for the future of Lennar Financial Services is to construct and maintain a fully self sufficient financial services platform that benefits from Lennar’s home building business but also drives profitability from retail operations as well. Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer overseas this operation and will discuss it further in his comments. 2015 has been an outstanding year for Lennar multifamily communities as well. LMC as we call it complements our core home building operations and allows us to provide a much needed housing alternative for an urban focused millennial population and a credit challenged first time home buyer in a tight mortgage finance underwriting environment. Driven by a multiyear shortfall of multifamily development, the fundamentals of the rental market are extremely compelling with historically low vacancy rates and low turnover in rising rent. Under the leadership of Todd Farrell and Eddy Easley we became the nation’s fifth largest developer of Class A apartments and have built a nationwide development, construction and management platform that will produce both significant short term profits for the Company and long term value for our shareholders. We have discussed on prior calls we started -- as we’ve discussed on prior calls, we started this business in 2011 as a merchant builder where we planned to sell our partner communities when we were leased and stabilized. In 2015, we augmented this strategy with the first close of Lennar Multifamily Venture, a build to core equity fund designed to allow us to hold our Class A income producing assets for continued cash flow and recurring earnings. Today, including both on our merchant built and built to core equity fund, we have a pipeline of over 21,000 apartments with the total development cost exceeding $6 billion. In 2015, our Rialto segment had an outstanding year as well under the leadership of Jeff Krasnoff and Jay Mantz, and continues to grow as a best in class asset manager. Our stated results were driven by increased management fees and returns from our asset management business and securitization gains in Rialto mortgage finance. These results do not include the substantial increase in undistributed hypothetical carried interest from our funds. Rialto has transitioned from being an asset heavy balance sheet investors to a capital light high return on investment vehicle. Our investment management and servicing platforms have been growing assets under management, in a little over six years we’ve raised almost $6 billion in equity and have invested close to $5.5 billion. We’re continuing to build upon this base from our first two real estate funds which have both been top quartile performers. Fund 1 has had spectacular performance. We have already distributed approximately 130% of invested capital with a long way to go. Fund 2 is also on its way. The final capital call occurred just this fourth quarter as we’ve invested over $1.6 billion of equity. We have already returned $300 million or about 23% of the original commitment and we’ve had our first closing of almost $510 million for Rialto real estate funds number 3. And to complement our real estate funds we also have almost $700 million of investor equity dedicated to mezzanine lending which will also be looking to grow as we move into 2016. Complementing our asset management business, Rialto mortgage finance run by Brett Ersoff, our high return on equity lending platform is focused on originating and securitizing long-term fixed-rate loan on stabilized cash flowing commercial real estate property. RMF is now the second largest non-bank CMBS originator by dollars volume and the largest by loan count. During the quarter, we completed our 24th securitization transaction, selling over $854 million of RMF originated loan, maintaining our strong margins and bringing our total to over $4.6 billion a securitizing loans since RMF inception. Rialto simply couldn't be better position for 2016 as the dysfunction in the financial markets and the new risk retention rules work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in both CMBS and broader financial products. Finally, our strategic investment in FivePoint property and its management team positions us to continue to benefit from some the best located land in California as the market continues to improve. As noted in our last conference call, FivePoint has filed a confidential registration statement for an initial public offering. We can't speak too much about FivePoint and will keep you posted as further information becomes available. In conclusion, we are very pleased to present our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results this morning. As we look ahead to 2016, we couldn't be more enthusiastic about the prospects for Lennar as all segments of our company are extremely well-positioned. As we said many times in the past, we are uniquely positioned as we have the right people, the right programs and the right timing to continue to perform as we have this year well into the future. And with that, let me turnover to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were 282 million, which is a 15% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 16% in the quarter, driven by a 9% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 6% year-over-year increase in average selling price to 347,000. Our gross margin on home sales in Q4 was 24.6% which achieved our goal of 24% gross margin for the full year. The prior year's gross margin percentage was 25.6%. The gross margin declined year-over-year was due primarily to increased land cost as well as Chinese Drywall settlement benefiting the prior year's quarter by 30 basis points. Sales incentives continue to decline this quarter at 5.9% versus 6.6% in the prior year. Gross margin percentages were once again highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. Direct construction cost increases have moderated as we continue through the year. These costs were up 5% year-over-year to approximately $52 per square foot and that was driven almost entirely by changes in labor. We have a continued focus on reducing material cost due to commodity declines primarily in lumber, copper, oil and steel. We were successful in improving SG&A operating leverage by growing volume organically in our existing home building divisions. Additionally, we continue to see the benefits of our focus on digital marketing. This is the lowest quarterly SG&A percentage in 15 years. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated subs was 14.7 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of 3.7 million in the prior year. This quarter's profit was primarily due to our share of the gain on sale home sites by our El Toro joint venture. This quarter we opened 61 new communities to end the quarter with 665 net active communities. New home orders were up 10% year-over-year and new order dollar value increased by 20%, excluding the Houston market these numbers were up 14% and 23% respectively. Our sales pace remained flat with prior year at 3 sales per community per month and the calculation rate decreased to 17% in the fourth quarter from 20% in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3,900 home sites totaling 250 million versus 254 million in the prior year's quarter. The lower land spend represents the result of our soft pivot strategy. Additionally, we were successful in bringing 240 million of previously mothballed assets into active production in 2015, so we can monetize those assets. Our home sites account owned and controlled is now at 166,000 home sites of which 126,000 are owned and 40,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1,100 homes which is in our normal range of one to two per community. Our financial services business segment had stronger results as Stuart mentioned with operating earnings increasing to 33.8 million from 30.2 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to 25.9 million from 23.8 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume as mortgage originations increased 23% during the quarter to 2.4 billion from 2 billion in the prior year. Purchase origination volume increased 24% as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and our expanded retail presence. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 83% this quarter from 80% in the prior year. During the quarter the new TRID regulations became effective and our mortgage title and homebuilding associates working hand-in-hand were successful in closing over a 1,000 transactions in our fourth quarter that fall into these new regulations. Our title company's profit increased to 8 million in the quarter from 6.9 million in the prior year and that was primarily due to higher volume over the past year. Our Rialto segment produced operating earnings of 7.6 million compared to 38.2 million in the prior year, both are net of non-controlling interests. Prior year's operating earnings included 34.7 million related to carried interest. The investment management business contributed 26.6 million of earnings which includes 4.7 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and 21.9 million of management fees and other. At quarter end, the undistributed hypothetical carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Funds I and II now total 146 million combined. We don't recognize those profits until we receive the cash. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed 854 million of commercial loans into four securitizations resulted in earnings of 16.8 million for the quarter. Our liquidating direct investments had earnings of 3.2 million and Rialto's G&A and other expenses were 31.9 million for the quarter and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was 7 million of interest expense. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with 150 million of cash. Turning to Multifamily, we highlighted this year that our fourth quarter should be the start of regular profitability being generated from this segment. We did in fact deliver a $10.2 million operating profit in the quarter and that was primarily driven by the segment’s 16.6 million share of a gain from the sale of an operating property as well as management fee income, which is partially offset by their G&A expenses. We ended the quarter with five completed and operating properties, 27 under construction, more of which are in lease up totaling over 7,800 apartments with a total development cost of approximately 1.9 billion. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower, it came down to 33.2% versus 32.7 for the year. Our tax rate reflects our focus on building energy efficient homes as well as homes with solar systems which provide valuable tax credits. Turning to the balance sheet, we have a high quality balance sheet that has been further strengthened this year with improved liquidity, reduced leverage and bolstered equity. Liquidity improved as we ended the year with approximately 900 million of homebuilding cash and no borrowings under our $1.6 billion revolving credit facility. Our leverage improved by 170 basis points year-over-year as our net debt to total capital was reduced to 42.2%. We grew stockholders equity by 17%, or 822 million year-over-year to 5.6 billion and our book value per share increased to $26.75. Our debt maturity ladder was enhanced as we opportunistically accessed the debt market in October assuming 400 million of eight year senior notes at 4.875% Now I'd like to provide some goals for 2016. First deliveries, we're currently geared up to deliver between 26,500 and 27,000 homes for 2016. We expect the backlog conversion ratio of approximately 70% for the first quarter, 85% for the second quarter, 75% to 80% for the third quarter and over 90% for the fourth quarter. We expect operating margins to be flat to down 50 basis points in 2016 and that compares to the actual in 2015 of 14.1%. The full year gross margin is expected to be in a range of 23% to 24% and the reduction in gross margin percentage should be mostly offset with operating leverage on the SG&A line. There will be seasonality between the quarters with first quarter being the lowest operating margins and then improvements as volumes increase during the year. Financial services are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to 2015 with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. With rising interest rates, we expect 2015 strong refinance market to slowdown in 2016. Turning to Rialto, we expect to range a profit between $35 million and $40 million for the year. The second half of the year is expected to have higher profitability than the first half. Multifamily expects to sell 8 to 10 multifamily communities in 2016 with the range of profits in total between $50 million to $55 million for the full year. The first and fourth quarters are likely to be the largest quarters and the second and third quarters the lightest. However, we should be profitable every quarter in this segment going forward. Looking at the combined category of joint venture profit, land sales, and other income, we expect to range $55 million to $60 million of profit primarily coming from the JV profit and land sales with just over half of this estimate currently expected in our third quarter. Corporate G&A is expected to be a flat percentage of total Company revenues year-over-year as we continue to focus on technology initiatives. Our tax rate in 2016 should be approximately 34%. Our net community count is expected to decrease approximately 8% to 10% from our ending count of 665 with the increased spread throughout the year. Our balance sheet in 2016 with our soft pivot strategy, our strong earnings contribution and $400 million deepen the money convert callable late in 2016 our leverage will be trending down year-over-year further strengthening our balance sheet. With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver another strong profitable year in 2016. And with that I’d like to turn it to the operator for questions. We’re ready to begin Q&A.
Operator: Thank you, Sir. Our first question comes from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Sir your line is open.
Robert Wetenhall: I just wanted to ask Bruce mentioned the soft pivot strategy. And I was hoping maybe Stuart or Rick or John, if you had any view on where are we in the recovery, is this like the fourth or fifth inning? And how should we think about land spend and investment going forward?
Stuart Miller: I think the way that we’re thinking about it is this, Bob, this has been a very shallow very slow and steady recovery unlike the kind that you would have expected in the context of such a deep and steep decline. It has been framed by mortgage availability and a variety of economic factors but because it has been slow and steady, we think that we’re probably earlier in the recovery cycle than one would expect for the duration that we’ve been at it. Now what that means is that from the standpoint of land, land has accelerated in pricing maybe even ahead of itself. So, in terms of the maturity of land pricing, we’re seeing that land pricing has recovered at a faster pace than the overall market. Land is still in short supply, so it is difficult to come by a location best located properties and the pricing is more of a retail nature than a deeply discounted nature. So the way we’re thinking about it is, we have a lot of runway ahead of us in terms of further recovery for the market as I’ve noted defined by the production deficit but at the same time with lands being a lot more pricy than it has been in the past. We’re really carefully managing our land acquisition and we’re also constraining growth. We could step on the accelerator and grow volume at an accelerated pace but that would mean reaching out for broader land deals, bigger land deals we’ve noted in the past that we’ve been managing both the front end and the tail of our land acquisitions in order to carefully balance maximizing pricing power, maximizing margins, and generating free cash flow at the same time.
Robert Wetenhall: With taking from your land inflation comments, it’s been a really strong year for average selling prices you guys are up 8% in the fourth quarter. Just trying to think against the 10% comp in 2015, what kind of expectations do you have for ASP performance in 2016 and just as kind of a housekeeping question, any color on your comments about the Houston market and the Miami markets from the press release that you've appreciated. Thanks and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Sure, thank you and I'll let Rick and John weigh in on that.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I would tell on an overall pricing standpoint, we're probably anticipating somewhere in the mid-single digits range about 4%, 5%, 6% and that we’ll definitely moved by market. Certainly we haven't underwritten any deals with any inflation to the extent that we get some upwardly moving price we’ll benefit from that on a performance standpoint. And with regard to Houston, I'll start off by saying that, it's a largest market in the country delivering about 28,000 homes and that in spite of the oil pressures there, it's still a pretty solid market. It's got fundamentals on the new home site there is about two months' supply of home which is good compared to the rest of the country. On resale side, it's about the same amount of supply, about two months homes are staying on the market and compared to what Houston has been historically and the rest of the nation, its strong market. And while job growth has accelerated primarily in the energy related sector, it's still net positive for the year with technology hiring, with the shipping sector being strong and with medical sectors bringing in employments. New home sales were definitely down year-to-date for us and the rest of the market. The market is being more sluggish on the higher price point but anything below 300,000 to 250,000 it's an extremely strong market. We are positioned in the market below the 310 price point and better located communities in the higher price point. If you look at our performance in the market, it's sort of interesting. Sales were down because as Stuart said, we regulated price pace, but our sales price for the quarter was up because we focused on margins and the price point below -- above 350 that 249 quarter and the 290 quarters are strong, Sugar Land is strong, Clear Lake is strong. And as I said below 300 it’s strong throughout the market. But we feel good about the position we have in the market, we are very focused on the land market there and I think we feel good, but it's a softer market there's no question, there is headline noise risk and that's impacted the market. With regard to Southeast Florida, we are very pleased with our performance there. Sales were up about 19% in Q4, closings were down and about 3%, but ASP was descent and our margins are strong. We're well-positioned for 2016 with great new communities coming onboard and we feel very positive about that core market. Jon?
Jon Jaffe: Hi, Bob, it's Jon. I would just add that as you look at the markets across the country that inventory story is a very healthy one. We don’t' see a buildup of speculate inventory in any of our markets and see a very healthy balance of supply and demand despite sort of demand headwinds as Stuart described there is still strong enough demand that is keeping inventory levels very tight, which should lead to continued pricing power although moderated by the overall environment.
Operator: Next question comes from Ryan Gilbert of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ryan Gilbert: In the West it looks like orders have slowed down a little bit sequentially. I am just wondering if that’s off of a tough comp or you've seen some demand slowdown there.
Stuart Miller: Jon?
Jon Jaffe: In the West, the markets that remain very healthy, as you look at California's overall market our sales pace was flat up just a little bit, compared to last year for the fourth quarter. And the Pacific Northwest our sales paces up year-over-year. Phoenix is flat to up a little bit and same with Nevada. So as you look at sales pace year-over-year very consistent, really don't see any slowdowns in any of our markets out here.
Ryan Gilbert: Great and then in Rialto, do you have a sort of target SG&A level that you guys are looking at or where do you think SG&A can go in terms of others or a percentage of revenue or assets under management?
Jeff Krasnoff: This is Jeff. In terms of overhead for Rialto, I think we're kind of getting to the point where we will got some very good operating leverage just year-over-year personnel costs remained relatively flat, but the number of assets under management are going up. So we don't have any specific guidance on that in terms of numbers and in terms of percentages because it's really more geared towards by products, where we're actually working at the moment, but we do see that we are well positioned from an operating leverage perspective.
Stuart Miller: I think Rialto is growing its bottom line maintaining its overhead level. Operating leverage is going to derive from growing assets under management, RMF continuing to perform at a very strong level and the continued depletion of some of our legacy assets which do take some additional management time and stress. So, you're going to see Rialto continue to improve its bottom line.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Dahl of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Michael Dahl: Just wanted to go back to the margin guidance on gross margins specifically and I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of -- you've got a range of basically flat to down a 100 basis points and how should we think about what some of the puts and takes are? Is it, as pricing stands now you'd hit midpoint, if you're able to push prices more aggressively to the high end, if labor cost accelerates to low end and this is -- is there anything you can give or -- like the some of the big buckets and what your expectations are within that guide?
Stuart Miller: Yes, well, look we've highlighted that you've got land costs that have been going up, you've got labor costs that have been going up, you've got pricing that is fitting in some market conditions and we'll see how that evolves, we're expecting kind of a mid-single digit increase in terms of ASP over the next year, as Rick properly point out. And offsetting some of that are some of the overhead considerations, some of the SG&A, we have some very strong some very innovative program to drive SG&A down even while normal -- normalized leveraging of SG&A will help margin overtime. We think that as we go through the year, we're going to see some of the programs that we've put in place really balance out some of the headwinds that we see in the marketplace and enable us to drive a really strong bottom line.
Bruce Gross: The only thing I'd add to that is the other bucket of activity that will temper some of the margin that we've had in the past, is we're bringing out some of our mothballed community in order to generate some cash at our inventory and those have margins that are lower than the company average.
Michael Dahl: And I guess just a follow-up on region-specific tying in Houston, so I guess it's been a market where the margins have been quite high relative to what builders would typically see in this market overtime and you made the comment around regulating pace and pushing price and some others have noted -- started to talk about maybe some slippage on price. So just wanted to get your sense of market dynamics around price there, how should we think about margins -- even if margins are holding up, you're kind of mixing away from Houston and so from a mix perspective seems like that might be a headwind to overall margins, any color there?
Stuart Miller: Margins at Houston are going -- are down year-over-year, given the decline in the market, there's still good margin for us as a company. But they're not as strong as they were a year ago.
John Jaffe: This is John, I'll add, our healthiest margins are on the coast in Florida, in California and those markets remain very healthy for us. So, you have that balance between on in Houston and then our strong coastal markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.
Dennis McGill: Just to close a loop on that last question there, Bruce is it fair to say if you back out Houston just given its size that the gross margin would actually be up across the company next year at this point?
Bruce Gross: Is it, I'm not sure that I would go there, I'm not sure how much the margins in Houston are actually going to come down, but it's likely that they’ll be more at least more flattish I would say.
Stuart Miller: Yes, I think look, I think when you get down to it, that's a mass question and we'd have to go back and run some numbers to give real answers to that. But look, I think there's a lot of averaging in looking at our margins, there're lot of moving pieces, Rick highlights bringing in some of our mothballed assets, Houston is part of the factor. Some of the markets are very strong, some of them are a little bit, a little bit more questionable like Houston. So, there is some averaging in all of that and we're trying to give guidance for a full year when in fact looking out over here a lot of things are likely to change. Not the least of which is the land landscape coupled with the labor constraints that are out there. Costs are clearly pressured to some extent. And then there's the opportunity to leverage SG&A and again I can't highlight enough, we think we have some really innovative components of our company that are focusing attention on leveraging SG&A even more than just normal averages.
Dennis McGill: Okay that’s fair and then Stuart you mentioned it a couple of times just now on the labor issue just curious for your opinion on how you would think about the almost on a go forward basis as well as it’s being talked about in a lot of different ways and I think everyone agrees it’s a challenge for the industry, but I think there is varying degrees of what builders are experiencing, varying degrees across markets. And also from a relatively standpoint it’s not clear I think based on how some of the companies have talked about it, whether this is a problem that’s getting worse, it’s been a problem for a while, or whether you are seeing any type of shift in the rate of labor inflation if you will. So I guess a lot in there but just curious on your thoughts how you guys are thinking about internally as you look forward?
Stuart Miller: Labor is a complicated factor. One of the big questions that people ask is where is all the labor gone and why isn’t it showing backup and how does it match with unemployment and wage gains everything. To me it’s kind of a double edged sword, on the one hand labor costs are going up on the other hand wages are going up and that means more people are going to be able to afford homes. And I think it’s generally a net positive for the industry. I know that there have been different accounts of the labor conditions, I think labor conditions are different in different markets. So different builders mix will play into that. Is it getting better or is it getting worse? I think it’s hanging around the same if we had a big spike up in volume for the industry, I think it would be very hard for the labor market to respond, it would be more constrained. But all of this speaks to the benefit of the largest best positioned best managed companies and I would have to put out in a top tier in that regard. We have an excellent management team, we’re very focused on having labor in place that we’ve worked with for many years. People that are used to being paid on time, used to being treated properly, we think our Everything’s Included program works to our benefit. It is a simplified production program, so it has enabled us to navigate these waters a little bit more confidently and consistently than perhaps some of the others. So given the simple platform, given our size and scope, given our management team, I think we are -- we feel that we’ll best in class in terms of being able to manage a tight labor market that we think is going to persist. Labor is not coming back to this industry in the quantity that we need to sustain growth going forward. So, being well positioned in that regard is a net positive for the Company.
Dennis McGill: And then just one last number, Bruce sorry if I missed this. But have you detailed how much labor on average have you funded across the country, is up year-over-year, the labor cost?
Bruce Gross: We said that it’s approximately 5%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Couple of questions, I guess my first question relates to land, and I would say, first off if you could help us put the rate at which you’re taking down your mothballed lot supply. I am wondering at the rate you envisioned taking that down into fiscal ’16. Like how many years on average do you think or how many years generally do you expect at that pace it would take you to work through your supply of mothballed lot? And then a second part of the land question is, can you refresh us exactly how much you spent on land and land developments this year and what your plans are for next year?
Stuart Miller: So on the mothballed communities I’d say it’s probably about a four year trajectory Steve, some markets will be faster and we brought a fair number of these communities in already. And there is some of these assets that require some land development, so that we brought into production but we may not get all the deliveries on them until the later years. But these are well positioned assets that we made a strategic decision during the downturn to not sell these communities and quite frankly that was -- looking back it was the right decision. With regards to land acquisition, I’ll give that to Bruce with regards to what we’ve spent.
Bruce Gross: So for the year Steve, we spent less on land acquisitions. Last year was a $1.410 billion this is $1.384, land development costs are slightly up last year it was just under $1.1 billion this year it’s $1.150.
Stuart Miller: And I guess the last thing I’d say on land acc is I think people need to be very focused on the difference between the purchase, the actual closing of the land deal and when the land was put under contract. And as we said, several quarters back going back into 2010, we had put under contract several assets that we’re still closing on today. And I think you’ll see that as we move into 2016 that several of these deals -- a lot of these -- most of these deals were pre 2016-2015 vintage.
Stephen Kim: Okay that's an important distinction, I appreciate that. Another somewhat related question to land, is the potential role of M&A. So I know as you guys look to deploy the assets often as you look at the entering a market or expanding your presence in the market through acquisitions, somewhat similarly to buying dirt [ph], I was wondering if you could comment little bit on what you see out there in terms of the M&A pipeline or sort of the deal flow [technical difficulty] in the context of your land commentary earlier? Thanks.
Stuart Miller: Okay, Steve, some of your questions didn't come through, so if I missed something you let me know, but we've always looked at M&A as an opportunity, but it's an opportunity that competes with what we think is an extraordinary and dynamic organic growth program. We simply have an excellent group that is focused on land acquisition growth organically and I think that we've been able to excel at that. So every acquisition candidate competes with that organic growth opportunity, so it's going to have to be something that really works quite well for the Company. With that said, in an environment where labor is in short supply, land is ever more complicated and we have what we think are fairly unique strategies there might be, can be, will be unique opportunities for groups that can benefit from some of our positioning to find our home here with us. And we think that, that attraction will ultimately find its way into M&A for the Company. Now if you look at the things that we've looked at, we've looked at just about everything in the marketplace, if you look at some of the things we've done, we recently close on some assets that could be considered in part M&A, we've got our cork in the water, we're looking very carefully but our standards are very-very high and we think ultimately the market will create attractions that bring M&A our way. Rick would you add to that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I think that Stuart is spot on, we look at the acquisitions from a margin standpoint, operating leverage standpoint and given the platform that we've got it's a pretty high bar. This last quarter we closed on -- we acquired some communities from another builder it's about 8 or 9 communities, smaller deal, but these were ones that we could bring into production relatively quickly, that’s cash-on-cash and pretty much during the same year within 16 to 19 months. So we look at everything. We got a high bar, but I wouldn't be surprised if you see us do some more of that as we move forward in next year or so.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: First question I had was just going back to the gross margin and operating margin guidance and you know congrats on executing this past year along your guiding, really strong performance there. Looking at your outlook for ’16, it occurred to me that if you kind of -- you give a descent range on gross margin. Obviously there is some variability that can occur throughout the year either with rates or labor or whatnot that could impact closing let's and perhaps that’s part of it, but to the extent that you are able to hit the higher end of that gross margin guidance range and at the same time I would expect you guys to be able to extract some amount of additional SG&A leverage, is there the potential for operate -- little bit of further operating margin expansion in ’16 or is that pushing the envelope a little bit, but it's seemed to be that perhaps there could be a little bit of a touch of conservatism here, just want to know your thoughts around that or are there certain factors that you're a little bit more cautious around?
Stuart Miller: No, listen, Mike I think that if you look at the market in general, the market has many elements that are moving around. We're not injecting conservatism. I think that the market has headwinds that are very real and that have to be navigated. You're hearing it from all of the homebuilders. I think that -- I think you're going to get excellent performance out of our company, but we're still going to be performing within the limitations of the marketplace in general. You hear about land constraint, the difficulties that you see across the board, companies acquiring land, it's difficult out there that’s a headwind. Labor is a headwind that -- even though we feel that we're advantaged in some of those ways, it's a limitation. So, I wouldn't be thinking in terms of us conservitizing our numbers, I think we're trying to give you a real picture of where we think things are. We've given us, we've given ourselves a fairly sizeable margin in terms of our guidance because we think that the market is volatile and difficult enough where it's uncertain as to where we're actually going to land, but I wouldn't think of it in terms of conservitizing our numbers or our performance.
Michael Rehaut: I guess, I guess I was just talking about if you were able to hit the higher end of the gross margin range that you would get a little SG&A leverage that at minimum you could hit on the flat operating margin if not perhaps slightly better, but obviously a long way to go to get there throughout the year.
Stuart Miller: Lot of work ahead of us, so we're going to have our head down and be focused on this, but I think that we're trying to give as good a guidance as we can, we don't have a crystal ball and we'll have to see how the year resolves itself.
Michael Rehaut: Second question, just following up on the M&A question and certainly you guys over the last 10, 15 years, 20 years have been opportunistic in a lot of different ways. Stuart, I was just kind of interested in your broader thoughts on the market, where we are right now, I mean there is quite a bifurcation of evaluation across the publicly traded builder universe where you have many builders at or below book value and I know that book value is -- can often -- it only gets you so far in terms of the valuation metrics, in terms of the underlying assets, real value. But as you look at across the publicly traded universe, what would be your expectations that let's say over the next two or three years for there to be some additional public-to-public M&A, like we've seen that points in the past?
Stuart Miller: Well, look, Mike, I'm sure that you've already crafted in your mind that here at Lennar we know the metrics associated with each and every one of the other -- or the potential M&A candidates. We think about, we look at, we dissect the opportunities that could and might be out there. We don't talk much about M&A, but let me broaden the discussion and say that we've developed a highly diversified platform. Let's not forget Rialto, let's not forget our multifamily operations and even our financial services groups. We think about M&A and combination in terms of each and every one of those groups and the multiple kind of parts that can be brought together and used as offsets. There are in our opinion limping antelopes out there for us to consider as targets across our platform. And those opportunities for us are enhanced as we focus on the organic side of our business, breeding excellence in each and every one of our components. So in the homebuilding world we've had a more vibrant kind of landscape where many are performing quite well, in other areas there are more difficult trajectories for some of the potential targets and we think there are opportunities there as well. As the landscape evolves we're looking at all of the opportunities in M&A to enhance our business and to build shareholder value. But in all instances an acquisition target is measured against an excellent organic growth program as the baseline and in order for us to engage M&A which is a lot of work and a lot of engagement, it's got to be something that works really well for our company.
Michael Rehaut: Just quickly, technically I'm sorry if I missed this, I was broken out before the call got dropped by me. Bruce can you give out guidance around for fiscal '16, the tax rate and your outlook for community growth, Bruce?
Bruce Gross: We did, we've said the tax rate for ’16 would be about 34% and the community count would grow in a range approximately 8% to 10%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is open.
Jade Rahmani: Actually my question is related to Stuart's last point, its clear Lennar has evolved into much more than a home builder. So I wanted to ask how you envision the story evolving from here. Do you think with the ancillary businesses the strategy will be to monetize individual vehicles through asset sales, IPO spin offs, M&A, or would you at some point consider creating an umbrella asset manager company to oversee the various businesses and even development of future businesses? Just want to know what you think of the asset management business?
Stuart Miller: We’ve been very tuned into the asset management business. We’ve of course modeled the number of scenarios relative to that. This is a process of construction. We are looking and have been looking at a variety of scenarios as to how we take these maturing businesses and enhance shareholder value. While we’re not opening the curtain just yet and giving a peek inside, I think that we have day-lighted the fact that we look at these as unique opportunity set to build shareholder value. I think we’ve got some real treasures in these ancillary businesses and whether they are looked at as in their entirety each individually or whether we bifurcate our thinking around the core asset and the management assets is something that’s very much on the table and that we think about pretty regularly. So, the answer is, we’ll all have to wait and see. It’s a dynamic environment and even the public markets are dynamic environments in that regard. I think that as a proxy remember that we have already highlighted that we are working on the programming for FivePoint and as more information becomes available and with our confidential filings, we’re going to keep the market apprised, but that’s one step in answering the question that you’re asking.
Jade Rahmani: On Rialto I wanted to ask if you think Rialto can continue to buy B-pieces [ph] primarily through third party funds as its industry leading, much as demonstrated, or with the onset of risk retention whether Rialto will need to put at least half of these investments on its own balance sheet in order to satisfy the risk retention rules?
Stuart Miller: Well, look the risk retention rules are in a dynamic phase right now. There is a lot of legal question around risk retention. We believe that Rialto is uniquely positioned to be able to benefit by the operation of the risk retention rules as they take shape and firm up. So, I can’t give you a definitive answer to that right but it is our belief that Rialto will be able to continue to invest a lot of money in that very dynamic investment class. And structurally while we might have to adjust in order to meet the risk retention rules in some way as they continue to evolve, we think that the momentum of the market is moving towards the Rialto like investor away from some of the hedge funds and other competitors that have been out there and Rialto’s strongly positioned to be able to do a lot more business in this arena and risk retention will really benefit our platform.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks for that. Appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Okay, let’s take one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Mark Weintraub of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
Mark Weintraub: Just first expanding on a lot of the answers you’ve given vis-à-vis capital allocation, M&A in the mix as a possibility, et cetera. Can you just also update us on your thoughts on where you want the balance sheet to be and return of capital to shareholders, how that gets prioritized in your thinking at this stage?
Stuart Miller: This is the question that occupies a lot of our management time. We have been focused over the past couple of years of turning our ancillary businesses into primarily asset like high returns, high turnover businesses and as I highlighted with Rialto that process is maturing. We continue to deplete legacy assets and enhance our asset light program on the apartment LMC side of the business. You’ve seen us make a strategic move this year towards a fund manager which enables us to become much more asset like in that regard as we go through 2016. FivePoint of course has been self-sufficient using its own capital for quite some time. The answer to the question is we’ve been moving away from capital heavily and towards capital light in all of our ancillary businesses and of course on the home building side we’ve talked about tapering back on land acquisition and land development, the land component of the business going less long -- not going short just yet, but less long over time. As Bruce highlighted the numbers, in terms of land acquisition we’re down a little bit year-over-year in terms of land acquisition. Really the more interesting thing is as we're growing our business, our land spend is fairly static right now which means as a percentage it's going down, we're really focused on a cash flow model which of course as we go forward we think is going to necessitate a question about how we start to think about returning capital, we will start by reducing our debt and that will start as we go into the future and then we will start thinking about capital return to shareholders.
Mark Weintraub: And on the debt side, is there a specific target or range that we should be thinking of this as where you'd want to take it to before contemplating other potential uses, share repurchase or what have you?
Stuart Miller: I think just as right now, I wouldn't give a specific metric on that, we’ll kind of wait and see, but remember that our leverage because of our substantial earnings has been drifting down and we will continue to drift down even if the debt level remain static. Nevertheless, we think that during the maturing of the home building market, we're going bring that debt level down before we start returning capital, but we will start returning capital as well.
Mark Weintraub: Okay and two real quick follow on, on Rialto, I just want to confirm, I assume you do not have recognition of carried interest in the guidance you've gave and what would cause there to be a booking of carried interest in 2016 possibly?
Bruce Gross: We did not include any of the carried interest in the guidance, unless there is cash that's received, that's what determines the booking and profitability.
Stuart Miller: Jeff you want to comment on it?
Jeff Krasnoff: This is Jeff. Yes, I mean in an essence, what’s been recognized today have been the advances -- under the documents we get advances against taxable income and that's basically what's been recognized to-date. There are -- in the guidance, those ongoing cash receipts are projected, but nothing in addition to that, unless the cash has been received. 
Mark Weintraub: Okay if there is a quick easy answer to it, on the mothballed communities can you give us a sense as to the -- roughly speaking what percentage of deliveries or revenues in 2016 are expected to come from mothballed communities?
Stuart Miller: About the same as we said in 2015, close to 10%.
David Collins: Okay very good, thanks everybody for joining us for our report this quarter and for yearend and we look forward to a vibrant 2016. Thanks for joining us.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

And we'd like to request that during Q&A, each person limit yourself to one question, one follow-up so that we can get as many participants as possible. So let me go ahead and begin. And I'll begin by saying that we are very pleased to report our third quarter results as we continue to perform consistently across our platform. Our performance really reflects our strong management team, executing our strategically crafted operating plan in what continues to be a solid macro environment for large well-capitalized company. Our homebuilding operations and associated financial services business continue to form the core of our operating platform. Our results reflect the slow but steady growth in the overall homebuilding market. This year, summer season and the spring selling season before it confirm that the market is continuing to improve at a fairly consistent pace. We continue to believe that the recovery in housing has been and will continue to be driven by strong and consistent demand. Employment is up. Labor is tight and wages are starting to rise. Millennials, who have been on the sidelines, are now starting to form households and are looking at housing alternatives. A growing number of individuals' balance sheets that were impaired by the economic downturn are starting to be repaired as the economy improves and as time passes and U.S. population continues to grow. Even as demand grows, supply remains limited. We have often discussed the production deficit of both rental and for-sale homes relative to the needs for housing in the United States over the years since the downturn. This deficit has created a supply shortage as the growing pent-up demand comes to market. Without a dramatic increase in the number of homes built in this country, we will continue to be short dwelling unit for a growing population. Even though supply is limited as demand is building, we do not anticipate a surge in production. Frankly, I don't think that the current market conditions could support a strong increase in production. A combination of land, labor and mortgage availability are simply put limiting factors to a surge in production. Limited capital for land and land development has left entitled lands in short supply while growing demands has driven up land prices. In most major U.S. market, the ability to grow quickly is limited by the available land, and the market's ability to bring new land to entitlement is limited by a constrained capital market for land developers. Homebuilders with strong land and capital position are able to carefully and methodically add some land position while less well positioned participant has seen margin and bottom line erode. Land continues to be the most challenging competitive environment in the homebuilders universe today. Running a close second, labor has also become a limiting factor. The slow and steady recovery in housing did not signal to the labor market that it was time to come back to work in the sector, and many found work elsewhere. Today, the entire labor market has tightened and rapid growth in housing production will be limited by available labor. Larger builders with consistent production and payment plan are better able to maintain production but an overly rapid growth in production with significantly stressful labor force. Finally, the regulatory environment for mortgages remains challenging and limits the number of entrants for the for-sale market. QM and QRM rules together with the ATR, that is the ability to repay rules, continue to restrict qualified purchasers from accessing the mortgage market. Adding to the complex landscape, [indiscernible] looms right around the corner as it complicates and slows the home closing process. While these rules have been evolving and easing at the margin, except for [indiscernible] of course which is just getting started, they have exacerbated an already impaired consumer psychology to create a perception that homeownership just might not be accessible. Even with that said, the pent-up demand is finding its way back to the market out of necessity. All of this portends an extended recovery and duration with a slow and steady slope and with continued upward pressure on pricing. With demand growing steadily, land limited, labor tight and constrained mortgage availability, we feel that we are in an excellent environment to run our business at a steady and consistent growth rate with strong bottom-line profitability and strong cash flow. Our strategy at the bottom of the market was to purchase land aggressively. As the recovery begins to take hold, we began a soft pivot towards a lighter land strategy and moderated growth. As the recovery has continued to mature, we have continued to adjust our operating strategy for current market conditions. We are using our strong land position to avoid chasing growth with low margin land deals. We are fortifying our operations to focus to build products and environments that attract the best of the limited labor force. And we are refining all areas of selling and marketing and overhead to drive consistent high net operating margins. All of these strategic components can be seen in our results this morning. Overall, this is a very favorable environment for a well-capitalized national homebuilder. We have believed and continue to believe that the down side in the housing market is very limited and the upside very significant. And of course, we believe that we are uniquely positioned within this market to continue to thrive. Of course, as we've continued to grow our core homebuilding business in the wake of the economic downturn, we also continue to grow and mature our additional business segments that represent significant opportunity to enhance shareholder value. Our multifamily program continues to complement our for-sale operation. We've continued to expand our national footprint and grow from a merchant build program to a build-to-own program. As first time purchasers have begun coming back to the housing market more slowly than expected and more slowly than they have historically, we have addressed this market in a comprehensive way. While approximately 30% of our homebuilding business continues to be geared to first time home purchasers and that's up, by the way, from 25% last year. Our broader, new household strategy has been aimed primarily at the rental market. Our $6 billion plus apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed as rental rates are soaring and vacancies are at historical levels. This is driven by a supply-demand imbalance. First-time households have had the most difficulty accessing the mortgage market. Credit limitations have been most constraining to the first-time buyers. And although that is beginning to open up as it has been reported, this segment is also the most susceptible to price and interest rate increases, and many have been and will continue to be relegated to the rental market, driving both rental rates and occupancies higher. A new study by the Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies and the enterprise community partners indicate that an increasing number of families are severely cost burdened by housing costs, indicating supply constraint in the rental markets. More rental product is needed, and we are well positioned to continue to fill this need and grow our multifamily platform. As I noted before, our core financial services group has continued to expand alongside our primary housing business while we have also expanded our retail platform. Additionally, we've been able to capture an expanded share of the refi business as it exists. Our Rialto Capital Asset Management platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types as an opportunistic play on the long duration recovery. The dysfunction in the financial market and the new risk retention rules work to the benefit of Rialto's core competence in CMBS and financial products. And finally, our strategic investment in FivePoint and its management team positions us to continue to benefit from some of the best located land in California as that market continues to improve. As noted during the quarter, FivePoint has confidentially filed a registration statement for an initial public offering, and we will keep you posted as further information becomes available. In conclusion, we are very pleased to present our third quarter results this morning, and we're confident that we have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and into the future. Now, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $223 million, which is a 26% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 22% during the quarter, driven by a 16% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 5% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $350,000. Our gross margin on home sales in Q3 was 24.1%, and we are still on track with our goal of 24% gross margins for the full year. The prior year's gross margin percentage for the third quarter was 25.2%. Sales incentives during this quarter continue to decline, and it was 5.6% versus 5.8% in the prior year's quarter. Gross margin percentages were highest in the East, Southeast Florida, and West region this quarter. The gross margin decline year-over-year was also a result of increased land costs. Year-over-year direct construction costs are up approximately 5% to $52 per square foot. Labor increased over 10%, which drove almost all of the increase, while material costs have remained relatively flat year-over-year. We have a continued focus on reducing costs due to commodity declines primarily in lumber, copper, oil, and steel. The total direct cost increases have moderated as we have continued throughout 2015. We remain on track with our previously stated guidance to achieve a 30-basis-point to 40-basis-point improvement in the combined selling, general and administrative cost and corporate G&A lines for the entire 2015. In this quarter, SG&A improved 50 basis points over the prior year. We continue to achieve improved SG&A operating leverage by growing organically in our existing divisions. And by the way, this is the lowest SG&A percentage of a Lennar third quarter going back to the late 1990s. Equity and earnings from unconsolidated subs was $13.3 million during the quarter, compared to a $2.1 million loss in the prior year. This was primarily due to a gain on debt extinguishment and the sale of home sites to a third party in our El Toro joint venture. And this was partially offset by some operating expenses and other JVs. This quarter, we opened 71 new communities to end the quarter with 673 net active communities. New homeowners, as you've seen in the release, were up a solid 10% for the quarter year-over-year, and new order dollar value increased 20% for the quarter. Our sales pace declined to 3.2 sales per community per month in Q3 versus 3.3 in the prior year. However, after adjusting for some softness in the Houston market on the move upside, our absorption would be flat with the prior year. And the cancellation rate this quarter was consistent with the prior year at about 17%. In the third quarter, we purchased 4,900 home sites, totaling $195 million versus spending $273 million in the prior year's quarter. The lower land spend represents the result of our soft pivot strategy that Stuart laid out. Our home sites owned and controlled now totaled 170,000 home sites of which 132,000 are owned and 38,000 are controlled. Completed unsold inventory is in check, with approximately 1,100 homes which is in our normal range of one to two per community. Turning to Financial Services, this business segment had strong results with operating earnings increasing to $39.4 million from $27.1 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to $31.4 million from $20.6 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume, as mortgage originations increased 43% to $2.4 billion from $1.7 billion in the prior year. Purchase origination volume increased 40% as a result of increased Lennar home deliveries and our expanded retail presence. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 82% this quarter from 77% in the prior year. Refinancings remained strong as refi origination volume increased by 74% versus the prior year. Our title company's profit increased to $8.2 million in the quarter from $7.1 million in the prior year, and this was primarily due to higher volume over the past year. Turning to our Rialto segment. Rialto produced operating earnings of $9 million even compared to $12.4 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interests. The investment management business contributed $30.6 million of earnings, which includes $7.6 million of equity and earnings from real estate funds and $23 million of management fees and others. At quarter end, the carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I, under a hypothetical liquidation, has increased and now stands at $112 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $519 million of commercial loans into three securitizations during the quarter, resulting in earnings of $14.2 million for the quarter, and that's the quarter G&A expenses. Our liquidating direct investments had a loss of $1.9 million for the quarter, but we continue to monetize these investments and increase our cash flow. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $26.9 million for the quarter, and interest expense, excluding warehouse lines, was $7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquid position with $107 million of cash. And as an update of fundraising, we're now reaching the end of our investing cycle for Fund II, and we are now in the process of working on our first closing of commitments for Rialto Real Estate Fund III. This is expected to occur during the fourth quarter, and it's targeted to be greater than the amount in Fund II. We continue to grow our multifamily operation, which has now grown to over 275 associates located in regional offices nationwide. We ended the quarter with three completed and operating projects, 28 projects under construction, of which 5 are in lease up, and over 7,700 apartments with a total development cost of approximately $1.9 billion. Included in these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $6 billion and over 20,000 apartments. As expected, we had an operating loss in Q3. The $3 million operating loss related to G&A expenses that were partially offset my management fees and the $5.7 million share of a gain from the sale of one of our operating properties. Turning to our tax rate, a decrease of 30% during the quarter. This is a lower tax rate in the first two quarters of the year, primarily due to a catch-up adjustment relating to validation of new home energy tax credits that were available to us. Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet liquidity remains strong as our home building cash balance ended the quarter at $596 million and there was $575 million borrowed under our $134 billion revolving credit facility at quarter end. Our leverage improved by 100 basis points year-over-year, as our net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 46.5%. We grew stockholders' equity by 17%, or $779 million over the prior year to $5.4 billion at quarter end. And our book value per share has now increased to $25.51. During the quarter, we converted $169 million of our 2.75% convertible senior notes. Of this amount, $122 million was converted through privately negotiated transactions where we retired the par value of the notes in cash and issued 2.9 million shares when the average stock price was $47.34. Turning to update goals for the rest of this year, let me start with deliveries, we are still on track with our delivery expectations for 2015 to between 24,000 and 24,500 homes. As a result, our backlog conversion ratio for Q4 should be between 90% and 95%. Turning to gross margins, we still expect our gross margins in 2015 to average approximately 24% for the full year. Our fourth quarter gross margin percentage is expected to be just a touch above our third quarter actual 24.1%. SG&A and corporate G&A were still on track with the expectation of 30 to 40 basis points improvement for all of 2015 with all of the leverage coming from the SG&A line. Financial Services, we are increasing our Financial Services earnings goal again for 2015. With the refi market driving higher volumes and stronger overall margins, we now expect to earn $120 million to $125 million for the full year. However, we continue to expect some cooling in the strong refi market as we finish out the year. Rialto is now expected to earn $25 million to $30 million for the full year. The recent market volatility that has been experienced has reduced the margin on securitization in our fourth quarter to the lower end of our normal range of 200 to 400 basis points in that business and the fees on the Rialto Real Estate Fund III will not have a significant contribution until 2016. Turning to Multifamily, we expect to have one apartment community sale in the fourth quarter which will result in a profitable fourth quarter for our Multifamily segment. There are no joint ventures or other transactions expected in the fourth quarter and therefore it should be close to a breakeven bottom line for the company's homebuilding joint ventures in the fourth quarter. We're still on track with approximately $25 million of wholly-owned land sale profit for all of 2015. However, some of those transactions were successfully accelerated and shifted from the fourth quarter into our third quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be about 34% for the fourth quarter. Our community count is still on track to hit a goal of 675 net communities by the end of the year. We remain well positioned to meet these goals as we finish our 2015. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mr. Stephen Kim from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.
Stephen Kim: Hello. Can you hear me?
Stuart Miller: Yeah.
Stephen Kim: Okay. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could give us the land spend numbers. I believe you gave a figure that just included the purchases or acquisitions. I was wondering if you could give us a figure that included development as well. And then my second question relates to cash flow. Can you give us a sense for how cash flow figures in your list of priorities for the company over the next year or two?
Bruce Gross: Steve, let me take the first one and then I'll turn it over to Stuart. So the soft pivot strategy has also been noted in the land development line as well. In the third quarter of last year, we spent $307 million on land development, and this year's quarter, we've spent $286 million.
Stuart Miller: Okay. And to the second question on cash flow, Steve, cash flow has been a central focus of our strategy since we started talking about our soft pivot. We've highlighted to you into the Street that we came out of the downturn with a very, very strong focus on land acquisition at the bottom of the market. Rick and John crafted a strategy that really positioned the company very well. We began off of that a soft pivot towards a shorter duration at the beginning and at the end, shorter tails for the land. And as the market has continued to mature and the competition for land assets has grown, we are very actively determined that we will not chase growth by pursuing tertiary location and low-margin land acquisition. And so we are focused on a combination of slower growth, more orderly growth, sustainable growth, and a focus on bottom-line cash flow and profitability.
Stephen Kim: Great. Thanks very much.
David Collins: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, maybe I just wanted to perhaps get a little bit of an expansion on your comments, Stuart, about not pursuing growth or stretching out beyond perhaps what was done in the last cycle. When you think about the last cycle, I mean we have growth numbers that range low-double digits to up to 30% or more, depending, or nearly 30% in 2001. Do you have sort of I guess a minimum type of growth that you're thinking about? Of course, this would be more of a mid-cyclish question not at the peak or repositioning where there might be the next downturn. But as a low-double-digit type of a growth environment, what you're thinking in the back of your head when you talk about more moderate growth rate or how should we think about just the core business over the next few years.
Stuart Miller: So, one thing I don't want to do is start equating to the last cycle, because this recovery is very, very different in its composition. We highlighted that there are some interesting and somewhat unique limiting factors. I highlighted land. I highlighted labor and I highlighted mortgage availability. And while land had been constrained in prior cycles, the labor constraint today is a limiting factor that is somewhat different than we've seen in the past and mortgage availability is clearly a very different overlay in this cycle. So, our view and our thinking has been to remain very focused on market conditions as they exist not try to drive our strategy with kind of a – just a reflection on past cycles but instead to adapt to the current market conditions. And we've concluded at an operating level that we're going to pursue land acquisition and growth strategy at levels that the market enables. And each of the professionals in our respective markets across the country, are looking at land acquisition as opportunistic as a primary driver of future margins. And we're just not going to be holding to this simple growth game of hitting a growth metric. So the answer to your question is, that we don't have a specific metric that we're solving to, but we are working within the confines of the existing market condition to strike the balance between orderly, consistent growth, and strong gross margins and especially strong bottom line and cash flow.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess the second question if I heard it right, the sales pace in the prepared remarks were I believe roughly down 2% year-over-year if you count, if you're comparing that against average community count. And I believe I heard that ex-Houston sales pace would have been more flattish year-over-year. I was hoping maybe to get a little more detail on what you're seeing in Houston market. Obviously, there's different commentary, there's been different commentary around different price points, different segments of the market. As well as perhaps to highlight some of your markets where you are seeing sales pace improved on a year-over-year basis.
Richard Beckwitt: Well, this is Rick, I'll talk about Houston. I would say that the Houston market is still overall a pretty decent market. Clearly with the decline in oil, the energy corridor there has been hit which is pretty much the far west side of the market. Now, if you look at that, it hasn't been across all price points. The lower price points, let's say, sub-$300,000, $350,000 are performing pretty well. It's just when you get up in that $350,000-plus, the price point sales has been impacted and have slowed. Those would be the big master plan communities that are on the west side of town. If you look in at Southwest, Northwest Houston, even at higher price points, those have slowed but they're still performing well. So it's price sensitive, geographically focused, but Houston is not one market, it's multiple markets. John, why don't you talk about some of the other [indiscernible].
Jonathan Jaffe: If you look at our different markets, California has seen the most acceleration and our sales pace, as well as growth in ASP. So, today [indiscernible] third quarter, California is representing up to 22% of our total revenues, it's up from 19% last year. With an average sales price of $507,000. Pacific Northwest is also seeing an acceleration in sales pace, as have parts of Florida seeing an acceleration. If you look at the rest of our markets, they are pretty much right around flattish year-over-year.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Nishu Sood: Thanks. I had a question for Stuart. Just your thoughts on the labor market. We're still pretty far below what most people would consider a normalized pace of housing construction. And whatever, obviously, unemployment has fallen, but the construction trades would seem to match up well with where there might be some relatively higher unemployment. So just looking for your thoughts on what do you think it's going to take for the labor market to ease poor construction. And how do you see that playing out as we get back to normalized in housing production?
Stuart Miller: Well, embedded in your question, I think, is exactly part of the problem. The slow and steady growth has not brought labor back to the housing market, and I think, overall, labor is constrained. So the ability of people to – we're not dealing with the same unemployment issue that we had at the beginning of the recovery, so there's not a large labor force to draw from. It's an increasingly complicated landscape in that we have a shortfall in production that is really revealing itself. You see it most prominently in the rental market right now. Occupancies are very tight, rental rates are moving upward, and we've already seen an acceleration in multifamily production. So the fact is that we're still under-producing normal rates of home production, and the labor market is already very, very tight across the country in all industries, but especially in the home market. So getting to a normalized production rate is going to be difficult, and it's why I say, I think that we have a slow and steady recovery. We're going to continue to attract labor back in. We're going to continue to see unemployment go down, I think, and some pressure on wages, which has a double-edged sword of bringing our costs up but bringing more people to the market to purchase. And over time, with limited supply and growing demand, it seems that there's been a – during this steady increase in the recovery, we're going to continue to see some pressure on pricing – on prices, loan prices as well.
Nishu Sood: Great. I appreciate the thoughts. And the second question was on the multifamily side. With the significant pipeline you've built up, you previously talked about some profitability from the fourth quarter, and, Bruce, you mentioned that again. You've also talked about with the pipeline having been built up, that the fourth quarter might mark the beginning of more consistent profitability in multifamily. Is that still the expectation?
Richard Beckwitt: Yeah. This is Rick. I think as we move into – in our fourth quarter and into 2016, we should be getting more predictable profitability from the group. One of the things that – something that we can't control is since we've got these investments and partnerships, a lot of times we can't control the sale decision. It's got to be a joint decision, and as a result of that, it may move from one quarter to the other. But as we look at it on an annual basis, we should be profitable from here on out.
Nishu Sood: Okay. Thanks for the thoughts.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Michael Dahl: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that first-time buyer mix is up to 30% from 25%, and I'm just curious if we could get a little more color, particularly as you've articulated kind of the challenges from an affordability standpoint, rising rents. So are you seeing a change in the type of product or square footage that your first-time buyers are opting for as you see that mix rise?
Stuart Miller: Let me let Rick and Jon kind of weigh in on this primarily, but I'll just say that we are – you might have listened to the opening remarks and heard that it is a constrained environment for first time buyers to come in. That remains the case and I meant to say it exactly that way. With that said, our first time buyer product offering and that across the homebuilding industry is increasing, it's mostly out of necessity. People are coming in and finding a way over time to access the mortgage market. And it is altering the landscape somewhat as the first time market does start to come back in, but there's a very, very large pent-up demand both in rental and in for sale for buyers that need to come back in.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jonathan. In many of our markets, we are addressing this by increased density in our product offering of simple product in some cases attached, in some cases cluster or a higher density product that allows us to achieve a lower price point and make today's land environment work for us to address this first time buyer need.
Richard Beckwitt: Yeah. It really goes back to 18, 24 months ago when we first started getting questions about our product mix and how were we're going to attack the approach to first time buyer. We strategically gone after a well located easy access communities where people can get to traffic [indiscernible] and we've designed product accordingly that's smaller footprint, lower specification level, a little bit more cookie cutter product that's easier build and more towards the product.
Michael Dahl: Got it. Thank you. And second question is going back to some of the market commentary, and thank you for some of the color that you gave. I wanted to dig in on a couple other markets that, I think, were kind of lumped into the flattish category like Phoenix, Dallas and Austin. So, on Phoenix, I think some others have been reporting a decent bit of strength in that market. And then, on the flipside, I think Austin and Dallas had been quite strong and we maybe hearing of some pause in the market in those areas. So just wondering if you could offer some colors specifically on those three markets.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon. I'll talk to Phoenix and let Rick handle the Texas markets. Phoenix is solidifying, seeing more strength over the earlier parts of the year. As you look at year-over-year, it's up just a little bit because the third quarter last year was decent and really saw a slowdown in the fourth, first quarters. Second was a little bit better and third is noticeably better as well. So, I wouldn't say it's strong again but it feels like it's a solid market today on an improving trend.
Richard Beckwitt: Yeah. I'm not sure we talked about the individual markets in Texas, about them being softer or flat. Quite contrary, Dallas performed extremely well, have seen sales price increases. But more particularly in that market, we're balancing pace and price because we secure some really trophy assets and want to make sure that we're maximizing the margins in these communities. Austin for us is really just a transitional market from the standpoint of we're moving to recent communities and have a bunch of new communities that are about to open, so you'll see a little bit better performance in Austin. But outside of Easton, Texas markets are performing well. We're seeing big job growth, good wage increases across the board and the state has really positioned itself well to attract employment.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon again. I'll just add that you just have to be careful as you talk about any submarket because even within submarkets, there are areas and product types that perform stronger than others, and it's very much a community-by-community analysis.
Michael Dahl: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now open.
Ryan Tomasello: Hi. This is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could provide your updated thoughts on consolidation in both the homebuilding market and in Rialto's various business lines, including CMBS special servicing, given that the role of the B-piece buyer in the CMBS market appears to be increasing in importance.
Stuart Miller: Hello? Seems that we got cut off, but, Rick, why don't you take M&A and homebuilding?
Richard Beckwitt: Yeah. On the acquisition side within the homebuilding space, we continue to see some private companies, some larger regional companies that are available for purchase. We're being very careful because, as Stuart said, we're very focused on the underlying asset values and want to make sure that if we're going to purchase something, if it's not taking us into a new geographic area, that we're purchasing something that's going to produce decent margins. We're fortunately very diversified as a company today, so there's very few geographic areas that would be new markets for us. So as a result of that, given the fact that we've got very strong land acquisition folks spread out across the country, the deal would have to pencil out for us to look at it. On the Rialto side...
Stuart Miller: Yes. Look, on the Rialto side, Jeff, why don't you weigh in?
Jeffrey Krasnoff: Yeah. I was going to say, as it relates – it sounded like the question was headed in the direction of special services [indiscernible] and special services really are sort of the gatekeepers for those transactions both upfront in terms of the timing and the collateral that goes into the transactions and after the fact in terms of overseeing the loans to ensure that they get collected. It's a relatively small group today. There aren't that many. I think if you look at the top four or five, it's probably 80% of the marketplace, but behind the time, there are opportunities out there. And when there are, we will take a look and the comments are pretty much the same as what Rick said, if the numbers make sense.
Stuart Miller: Yeah. So adding to that is the question my opinion of what risk retention does to the landscape because special servicing combined with B-piece purchasing as a significant part of enabling a [ph] risk (44:16) retention environment. The amount of capital required for that business is going to get bigger. I don't know that M&A is the direction or not the direction that we go, but it opens up a band of opportunity. And frankly, it's the five that's going to have to be absorbed. So, there's tremendous amount of business in that arena that is – that's going to divide – that's going to define the next wave of activity. We're very well positioned for it.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for taking that question. And this is a follow up, you previously noted that you have a single family rental community. I was wondering if you can provide an update on whether or not you're seeing any indications if that makes you more positive or negative towards that sector.
Stuart Miller: We are decidedly more positive relative to that sector, specifically the way that we are doing it, which is a kind of unified community of single-family homes. We think that single-family product is desirable, We think that the leverage, the management leverage associated with a community approach to single family is very attractive and provides management efficiencies. The single family scattered approach I think still has some elements of shortcoming, although the product is very desirable. And we expect to expand on that platform as we go forward, there are still some complications in terms of the financing of those kinds of communities. And really defining what the rental rates are for those communities. But our first experimentation is proving to be very successful. I would add parenthetically, that expanding that platform comes with all of the challenges of accessing the labor market and actually getting the homes built. So we're still in the experimentation phase. We think it's a really unique opportunity that rides right between our for-sale single-family operations and our multifamily rental operations. And we're uniquely qualified to be moving in this direction.
Ryan Tomasello: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you, the next question is coming from Mr. Ryan McKeveny from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open.
Ryan McKeveny: Thank you, and nice quarter. Given the continued upside in terms of profitability in the financial services segment. Can you just elaborate on your expansion of your retail presence? And you do see any low-hanging fruit to continue taking share in that retail purchase business to essentially drive profits even if we do see things slow on the refinance side?
Bruce Gross: Yeah, this is Bruce. We continue to look for the right fit within our program. So there are opportunities to look at, some bolt-on acquisitions like we did last year with the Pinnacle deal. That's worked out very well. It's been integrated extremely well. And if we could find other opportunities like that, we'd be very interested. One thing to highlight is that when the refinance market is hot, the margins that we earn on both the purchase and the refi business is above normal type of margin. So we do expect that as refis maybe taper down a little bit, as we go through the latter part of this year, there might be a little bit of margin compression as well. But, again, our folks are looking at continuing to expand the retail presence. We don't have a full national footprint yet, but we're growing it. But we're going to make sure we do it with the right types of programs and the right people.
Ryan McKeveny: Great. Thank you. And then also on the topic of mortgages, just any update on where you think you as well as the industry stand in terms of TRID implementation, and any anticipated delays on deliveries within that guidance that you gave for the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Bruce Gross: So, October 3rd is the date that TRID is implemented for new applications, and our team has been very focused with the software vendors and with training to make sure it goes as smooth as possible. We think we're in good shape because we're fortunate to have our homebuilding team, our mortgage associates, and our title associates, and our IT associates all working together. We don't control what happens outside of our mortgage company, which is about 20% of the business, but we are as well positioned as we could be. Keep in mind, often when you have some deliveries you might pick up at the very end of the quarter or year, that makes it tougher because of the three-day waiting period if any changes are made. But we're as well-positioned as we could possibly be at this point. Look, TRID is a combination of waiting period and process. And we've been training and operating under a TRID-like environment. So we expect that our operations are going to be well-positioned to handle volume and to have a good smooth year-end closing.
Ryan McKeveny: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group. Your line is now open.
Stephen East: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Both in your prepared comments, Stuart, in the press release, you talked about land and land inflation, a few things around that. Could you talk about how long do you think it would be for the industry before we get to the sufficient finished lot supply on the ground more broadly speaking. I know every market varies, but is this a one year, two years, three years type thing. And then could you talk about on the land inflation side, how much is it up year-over-year? You talked about labor being up 10%. How much do you think land is and sort of rank order of the regions of the most inflation?
Stuart Miller: So, look, I think that the land market is constrained in lot of levels, not the least of which is the capital constraint. The traditional lending avenues have remained close to the land asset as a basis for opening doors to lending. And so as production is really being forced to expand to normalize, land is behind the eight ball, and the enabling factor – that is, the access to capital – is continuing to constrain the ability to entitle new property. So I think this is a long-term deficit that we're going to see limiting the ability to expand production and to – or to even normalize production, and we think that keeps pressure on home prices to go up and land prices as well. I think that what we've seen is probably a 14% kind of inflation factor for land on an annual basis right now. I don't know, looking ahead, what the right number is in terms of land prices going up, but we're uniquely positioned with a really strong land position to leverage off of. We're able to be more deliberate, careful in our approach to purchasing the next parcel. And as long as we don't try to accelerate growth but instead remain steady, I think that we're really advantaged in our ability to navigate this market. But with that said, in most land markets, you're seeing land prices accelerate because of that scarcity and limited access to capital. And maybe Rick and Jon would like to weigh in on specific region.
Richard Beckwitt: As you would expect, Stephen, is you'll see more acceleration. For example, in Coastal California, some Coastal Florida, you see less acceleration in the center part of the country. Just as you would normally expect and you can follow sales price trends to sort of look forward to see what happened to land markets there.
Jonathan Jaffe: Yeah. The Texas market, you're not going to see as much because land comes on faster and there are some larger developers there. But all this context, Steve, I can go back to what Stuart said at the beginning is while pricing is going up across the board for most of the people out there. We're not really facing as much of a headwind. It gives us the opportunity to be more selective, more opportunistic because we were very aggressive going back to 2009.
Stephen East: Okay. And that is a great answer. I appreciate all of that. And then just sort of a little bit of a hodgepodge here. Bruce, you talked about refi on the financial services. Could you give us an idea right now what percentage of volume and profits, refi would be versus purchase? And then on the pricing, your house price are about 5%. How much of that is mixed versus true pricing power would you say?
Bruce Gross: Let me take the question on the refi season. So, as you look at actual originations, originations were only 11% of total originations this quarter even though it was up 74% over the last year. But when we look at profitability, we have a high refinance market who end up earning better margins than you would in a normalized market because the purchase business is fighting for more deals. And everybody's busy and has enough activity, you tend to end up with better margins. So the true profitability from refi is a little bit hard to calculate because we're typically – we would typically make somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000 per lot loan. This quarter, we were over $3,300. So we would expect to be back and maybe at $2,500 to $3,000 range as the refinance market cools off a bit.
Stephen East: Okay. That's helpful. And then on house prices, just to understand, because you had mentioned that – we offset some of the land cost with pricing. So I'm just trying to get a feel for how much is mix and how much is true pricing power?
Stuart Miller: I would say that given the fact that our first time buyer profile is moving up, that's more towards the lower end. It makes us probably been more of a moderating factor. And I think that would be a proxy for the housing market at large. I think you probably – when you start to see – I think in today's existing home sales numbers, we saw a reduction in the median home price. But I think that what you're seeing is a little bit more mixed towards the lower end. And I think that's reflective of the fact that at the higher end, the more desirable areas, there's just very limited supply. And so you're not actually seeing a decrease in demand that the higher end, it's just a decrease in the number of actual deliveries. And this got a higher percentage of lower price and that's bringing the medium price down. I think that's more of the case in our numbers as well. Bruce, would you agree with that?
Bruce Gross: Yes. No. I think you're spot-on.
Stephen East: All right. Thank you all.
Stuart Miller: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Mr. Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now open.
Eric Bosshard: Thank you. In terms of gross margin, you did a good job walking through the moving pieces within that. I'm curious as you think about the land relative to selling price and what you see going on with labor costs, if you have any thoughts for us on how we should think about how this works moving forward just beyond the current year. I'm not necessarily asking specifically for guidance, of course, but how you think about those moving pieces as we work through the cycle.
Stuart Miller: Given that the market continues the slow and steady recovery, I think we see more of the same with generally the ability on like products be able to increase prices as there isn't enough supply to match demand and to offset those labor costs and land costs. And as was stated, as we – see our mix trend to more of our lower priced product, that will have an overall effect of bringing down our ASP, not necessarily our margin, though.
Eric Bosshard: Great. And then secondly, in the same construct, as you think about the ability to lever SG&A in the homebuilding operation, is there anything that changes with your ability to improve efficiency as it influences how that performs going forward?
Stuart Miller: I think we continue to find leverage particularly on the sales component of that as we focus on our online strategy and look to reduce costs there. And then with our – as Rick said, we're well positioned across the country, in the markets that we're in. So as we continue to add community count, I think we'll continue to see some G&A leverage there as well.
Bruce Gross: And I would just add to your first question there, we did have a higher percentage of deliveries coming from California this quarter where you have an average sales price. So our land costs also increased as well because, in California, the percentage of the home price relating to land is a little higher. So that 14% is a little bit more weighted higher this quarter because of the product mix.
Eric Bosshard: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee CRT. Your line is now open.
Jay McCanless: Good morning, everyone. First question I had on the spec count, you guys talked about 1,100 I believe this quarter. What percentage of your deliveries came from spec and where do you – what do you anticipate that will go? And especially as you broaden out in the more entry level, do you think you're going to be relying more heavily on spec product?
Stuart Miller: Well, on the spec for the entry level, we're pretty much build to order and most of our first-time buyer markets, we, as in any community, need some product there for immediate delivery homes. But our spec strategy doesn't really vary by that price point.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon. If you look at it, we've consistently run at a spec level about one to two per community depending on the time of the year and we track pretty well with that. So we don't see any increase or decrease in the way we're operating our day-to-day business.
Jay McCanless: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. The second question I have on the apartment business, could you remind us how many of – I think it's 28 total between construction and completed. How many of those are wholly-owned by Lennar and how many of those are owned by JVs?
Stuart Miller: All of these 28 are owned by JVs.
Jay McCanless: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: And this will be our last question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now open.
Buck Horne: Hey. Thanks very much. Going back to labor real quickly, I was wondering if you look at the – as you're thinking ahead of 2016 and the tightness of the labor markets. I think consensus out there is expecting your total deliveries to be up around 10% year-over-year in 2016. But is there any growing risk that the labor shortages that you're seeing or the tightness could create backlog cycle time issues and maybe push out some deliveries?
Stuart Miller: Well, as I noted in the remarks, the larger builders have been singularly advantaged in the current environment. It's a combination of – and especially in our Everything's included, being able to simplify our product offering is a big advantage for us. But additionally payment schedules, subs are looking for consistent workload with dependable payment schedules, and they have the ability to do a little bit of picking and choosing, and they're definitely aligning with larger, better capitalized builders. As we've navigated the shortage of labor, we have found that we're able to consistently run our operations and deliver without too much of a hiccup. Can that change over time? It certainly can, and there's no way to predict the future. But we're not anticipating that at this point. We feel very comfortable that we're able to leverage our position and keep production machines going at pace.
Buck Horne: My last one is just more of a policy-type question because we are entering that season of the political cycle and immigration policy has been a significant hot-button issue already. But do you have any concerns or industry view if we continue to see a tightening of immigration policy become an even bigger political movement? Is that something that could affect the homebuilding industry into 2016?
Stuart Miller: I think about this a lot. I think that you listen to some of the political rhetoric and you – sometimes you just want to go hide under your sheets and not come out, but I think practically speaking, the practical landscape is going to moderate. If you listen to some of the discussion this weekend, it sounds like we're gearing up to accept the whole new group of immigrants from the Middle East. And so there are a lot of offsets and questions embedded in all of this. I think labor shortage and the way that the country has been wired historically – common sense kind of tells me that this is going to even out and we're going to see kind of an orderly approach to immigration. And it won't be a singular kind of negative impact. But you go to extremes and you start to say we're going to support 11 million people, then we have to start to think about that. We'll have to see how it plays out, but I think that common sense says it finds equilibrium and we're going to be okay.
Buck Horne: Okay. I appreciate your insights. Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Very good. And listen, I want to thank everybody for joining us and look forward to reporting year-end at the end of our fourth quarter. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Now I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller : Great. Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter conference call. This morning, we are in New York City at our Rialto Capital office for our Board meeting yesterday and for today’s conference call.  I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Rick Beckwitt and Jon Jaffe are here along with Jeff Krasnoff and other members of our management team as well. Some will join in for our Q&A period. This morning, I'm going to be very brief in my opening remarks, as I feel that our views about the market have been consistently expressed on prior calls. Bruce is going to jump in and breakdown our financial detail and then, as always, we'll open up for Q&A. And as always we'd like to request that during Q&A, each person please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. So, let me go ahead and begin and begin by saying that we're very pleased to report our second quarter results, as we continue to perform consistently across our platform. Our performance reflects our excellent management teams, some of whom are here with us this morning, executing their well-crafted operating strategy in a solid macro environment.  As we’ve grown our business in the wake of the economic downturn. Lennar has become not only the most profitable homebuilder in the business, but we continue to grow and mature our additional business segments that represent significant opportunity for the future. Simply put, Lennar has become much more than just a homebuilder.  With that said, it’s still the home building macro environment that defines our core operating strategy across our company. As we noted in many of our prior conference calls, and some of our other public statements, we continue to believe that we are still in the early stages of a multi-year, slow but steady housing recovery. This year’s spring selling season confirms that the market is continuing to improve at a very consistent pace. Over the past couple of years in our conference calls and public statements, we’ve noted a number of themes that define the uniqueness of this recovery, and they’ve informed our operating strategies.  Let me briefly review some of those themes: First, the production deficit of both rental and for sale homes relative to the need for housing in the United States continues to create pent-up demand against a very limited supply. Without a dramatic increase in the number of homes built in this country, we will continue to be short dwelling units per growing population, supply is limited and demand is building.  Next, the regulatory environments for mortgages remains challenging and limits the number of entrants for the for sale market. QM and QRM rules together with ATR, the ability to repay rules, continue to restrict qualified purchasers from accessing the mortgage market.  While these rules have been evolving and easing at the margin, they have exacerbated and already impaired consumer psychology to create a perception that home ownership just might not be desirable. Demand is slowly coming back to the market. Third, the millennial generation is changing a lot of thinking. Their attitudes are proving to be different and the doubling up of the millennials during the downturn will ultimately unwind and give way to household formation.  We’ve already seen evidence that this is beginning to happen and household formation is beginning to grow. While new households might not be able to or desire to purchase a home, they will need a place to live and rental might be their only option.  Fourth, first time purchasers have begun coming back to the housing market more slowly than expected and more slowly than they have historically. They’ve had the most difficult accessing the mortgage market, credit limitations have been most constraining to the first time buyers, and although that is beginning to open up as many have reported, they are not yet jumping in to the market place and they are also the most susceptible to price and interest rate increases.  Finally, a slow steady recovery with limited land supply and limited access to capital, constrains the number of smaller, less capitalized home builders that can compete for the smaller demand. This has enabled the larger better capitalized builders to pick up a larger portion of the smaller pie. Overall, this is a very favorable environment to be a well-capitalized national home builder. We have believed and continue to believe that the down side in the housing market is very limited and the up side is very significant.  We believe that the market is downside supported by the production deficit that has yielded a limited supply of both rental and for sale housing in the country. Any pullback in the housing market will be short lived as there is a need for shelter across the country and there’s very little inventory and almost no likelihood of mortgage foreclosures given the stringent underwriting standards of the pas years.  And while demand has remained constrained, buyers have continued a steady return to household formation and home ownership as the market opens up, driven by consistently low interest rate and now higher wages and lower unemployment.  These are the themes that have continued to define our operating strategies across the company. In home building, we have continued to focus our attention primarily on the higher end first time buyer and the move-up market, as our average sales prices reached an historical record high of $348,000 this quarter. While approximately 25% of our home building business continues to be geared to first time home purchasers, our broader new household strategy has been aimed at the rental market. Our $6 billion apartment strategy is proving to be very well timed, as rental rates are soaring and vacancies are at historical lows, driven by supply-demand imbalance.  Our financial services group has continued to expand alongside our primary housing business, while we’ve expanded our retail platform to become the 5th largest retail, non-bank lender in the nation, and we are able to capture an expanded share of the refi business as it exists.  With that large scale infill community strategy in five points, we’ve positioned ourselves to benefit from some of the best located land in California, as that market continues to improve.  And finally, our Rialto Capital Asset Management platform enables us to invest across real estate and financial product types, as an opportunistic play on this long duration recovery. In conclusion, we are very pleased to present our second quarter results this morning, and we are confident that we have the right people, the right programs, and the right timing to continue to perform this year and in to the future. Let me turn it over to Bruce. 
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were 183 million, which is a 33% increase over the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 30% in the second quarter, driven by a 20% increase in wholly owned deliveries and an 8% year-over-year increase in average selling price to 348,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the second quarter was 23.8%, and we are still on track with our goal of 24% for the full year. The prior year’s gross margin percent of 25.5% included a $9.6 million benefit relating to insurance recoveries and other non-recurring items which benefited the gross margin percent by 60 basis points. Sales incentives declined sequentially from 6.3% in the first quarter to 5.8% in the second quarter, and from 5.9% in the prior year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was also due to increase land cost.  Year-over-year labor and material costs are up approximately 7% to $52 per square foot. This is consistent with the year-over-year change that we noted in the first quarter. We have a continued focused effort on reducing cost due to commodity declines primarily in lumber, copper and steel. We are still seeing offsetting labor and manufacturing pressures across products and geographies.  Our previously stated guidance was to achieve a 15 to 25 basis point improvement in the combined SG&A and corporate G&A lines for all of 2015. In this quarter, we exceeded that guidance as SG&A improved 80 basis points over the prior year. This was primarily driven by operating leverage resulting from this quarter’s organic growth, as our 30% increase in home sale revenue came out of our existing 31 home building divisions.  Our corporate G&A lines was 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues. The operating leverage on this line was offset by increased investments in technology, as we are focused on improving productivity in all aspects of our business. Gross profit on land sales totaled 3.5 million versus 5.6 million in the prior year, and equity and earnings from unconsolidated subs was 6.5 million in the second quarter, which was primarily driven by the sale of commercial land at our El Toro joint venture to Broadcom. This was partially offset by operating expenses and other joint ventures. Other interest expense declined year-over-year from 10.3 million in the prior year to 3.8 million in the current quarter. This quarter we opened 96 new communities to end the quarter with 667 active communities.  Our sales pace improved to 3.8 sales per community per month in the second quarter versus 3.7 in the prior year, and in the second quarter, we purchased approximately 6000 home sites totaling 445 million versus 379 million in the prior years’ quarter.  We have been continuing to focus on targeting shorter duration land purchases as part of our soft pivot strategy, however this quarter it also included the strategic acquisition of a mixed used parcel totaling 151 million adjacent to the Tesla car plant in Fremont, California.  Our home site count for owned and controlled now totals 168,000 home sites, of which 133,000 are owned and 35,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory ended the quarter with approximately 1000 homes which in our normal range of one to two per community.  Our financial services business segment had strong results with operating earnings increasing to 39.1 million from 18.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income increased to 33.5 million from 16.7 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume as mortgage originations increased 72% to 2.4 billion, from 1.4 billion in the prior year. The increased volume resulted from a strong refinanced market, as well as further expansion of our retail channel, more home closings by Lennar, and higher capture rate of Lennar home buyers.  The capture rate of Lennar home buyers improved to 82% this quarter from 77% in the prior year. The expansion of our retail channel has positioned us to capitalize on the strong refinance market this quarter, refinance volume increased by over 300% versus the prior year to 450 million in originations. However approximately 80% of our total originations this quarter were related to purchase volume. With the recent increase in mortgage rates, we don’t expect the refinance activity to continue at the pace of the first half of this year; however we are still well positioned to capture additional purchase business as the housing recovery continues.  Our title company’s profit increased to 5.1 million in the quarter from 2.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher volume and benefits from strategic initiatives including closing of less productive branches over the past year. Our title team continues to focus on maximizing the title opportunities within our ancillary businesses. Turning to Rialto, our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling 7.6 million, compared to 13.4 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The investment management business contributed 30.4 million of earnings which includes 7.3 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and 23.1 million of management fees and other which included 4.8 million of a carried interest distribution from Rialto Real Estate Funds to cover the income tax obligation resulting from the allocations of taxable income to Rialto.  The carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I under a hypothetical liquidation now stands at a 108 million. Rialto Mortgage Finance continues to generate consistent earnings. This quarter they contributed 721 million of commercial loans in to three securitizations, resulting in earnings of 29 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses.  Our liquidating direct investments had a loss of 3.1 million, and Rialto, G&A and other expense were 41.9 million for the quarter and interest expense including warehouse lines was 7 million. Rialto ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with over 176 million of cash. Our Multifamily operations continued to grow. We now have over 230 associates located in regional offices nationwide.  We ended the quarter with two completed and operating communities, 24 communities under construction, six of which are in lease-up, totaling over 6600 apartments with a total development cost of approximately 1.6 billion. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceed 6 billion and over 20,000 apartments.  As expected there were no sales in the second quarter, and we had an operating loss of approximately 8.7 million. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.2% and our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong, as our homebuilding and cash balance ended the quarter at 639 million and during the quarter we increased our credit facility to 1.6 billion which includes a 263 million accordion and also extended the term to 2019 and reduced the interest rate.  There was 450 million outstanding under this facility at quarter end, and our leverage improved this quarter as well by 50 basis points year-over-year, as our homebuilding net debt-to-total cap was reduced to 47.5%.  We grew stockholders equity of 17% year-over-year to 5.1 billion, and at quarter end our book value per share increased to $25.04 per share.  During the quarter, we issued 500 million of 4.75% senior notes due in May of 2025. This issuance extended our debt maturity ladder, continued to reduce our borrowing rate and further strengthened the company’s financial condition.  Finally I wanted to update our goals for 2015. Starting with deliveries; we are increasing our delivery expectations for 2015 to between 24,000 and 24,500 homes. With the recent rains in the central region, we experienced some minor construction delays at the front end of construction and therefore we are updating our backlog conversion ratio to approximately 75% for the third quarter and a range of 90%-95% for the fourth quarter. Second, we still expect our gross margin in 2015 to average 24% for the full year. Our third quarter gross margin is expected to be close to what we just saw in the second quarter, while the fourth quarter is expected to be a little bit higher.  Third, we are increasing our expectations on corporate G&A and SG&A leverage, as we are now expecting potential improvement for these combined categories to 30-40 basis points at you look at the full 2015 fiscal year.  Fourth, financial services, we are increasing our goal for financial services earnings, to earn 100 million to 110 million for the full year, included in this increase guidance is the expectation of some cooling in the strong refinance market in the second half of this year. The remaining quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to last year.  Rialto is still expected to generate profits between 30 million and 40 million for the year and that’s weighted a little more heavily to the fourth quarter, and our Multifamily operations as we’ve seen strong rent growth in our lease-up communities, our partners have decided to maximize the sell price in two of our rental communities and therefore we are moving the sale of two communities in to early 2016. We are now expecting three communities to be sold in 2015, one in Q3 and two in Q4. We expect a small loss in Q3; however, Q4 should mark the start of consistent quarterly profitability for our Multifamily segment.  Next our joint ventures in land sales we continue to expect closer to breakeven bottom line for our joint ventures in Q3 and Q4 and we are on track with approximately 25 million of wholly-owned land sale profit for the full 2015 with the bulk of the remainder forecasted for the fourth quarter.  Our tax rate is still expected to be between 34% and 34.5%, and we are right on track to hit our goal of 675 net communities by the end of the year. With these goals in mind and backlog dollar value up 23%, we are well positioned to deliver strong topline and bottom line growth throughout the remainder of the year.  Let me now turn it back to the operator for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Mr. Stephen Kim with Barclays. Sir your line is now open. 
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much guys. Strong results, good to see. Thanks for all the details, well done on the guidance. A couple of questions, the first question I think that’s probably is on everybody’s mind is, with the strong order pace that you’ve seen, if you could provide a little bit of color around, particular market segments I would say, in particular the entry level, what are you seeing there in a way that you could possibly break out for us. And then also surrounding the order question, are you seeing an ability to sort of raise prices within your communities. If you could sort of comment about that because there obviously a lot of mix shift that kind of comes in to play.
Rick Beckwitt: Sure, Steve, it’s Rick. I would say that across the board in all product types we are getting pricing leverage. It varies by market and by community, but pretty much across the board we’ve seen pricing power. We don’t know how much longer we’ll be able nudge prices up, and consistently as we’ve done in the past balancing pace and price, but we are seeing pricing power.  And some markets are much stronger, California and Northern California we are seeing great strength. We’ve seen good strength in the central part of the United States. Sales prices were actually up in Houston as well. So we are pretty confident that that’s going to continue. 
Stuart Miller: Steve, this is Stuart, a lot of people are asking about the first time homebuyer, and as Rick noted it’s really across the board that we are seeing improvement across markets. That includes the first time homebuyer. We are starting to see the first time homebuyer come back to the market place, but from basically a very flat level of virtually non-existent first time homebuyer to some beginnings of improvement.  It feels a lot better, it feels like the first time buyer is coming back but they are not jumping into the market, still constrained by the mortgage market. So we’ll have to kind of sit, watch and wait till the next quarters to see how that first time buyer market continues to evolve.  As Rick Noted, you are seeing some pricing power and the first time buyer is probably the most sensitive group to price increases and interest rate fluctuation. So I think it’s going to be a push and pull program for some time to come, as pricing power continue to be pretty strong. 
Stephen Kim: Yeah, absolutely, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. The second question I had, I am going to jump over to the joint venture line. I think you’d mentioned last quarter you are going to have the sale to Broadcom and that building we actually saw that when we were out there. And you mentioned that that gain was offset by some, I think you said expenses in some of the other JVs. Can you just describe was there something that’s sort of temporary in some of those other JVs that were leading to a loss this quarter that offset the gain from Broadcom, am I understanding that properly? And then also was there anything new to talk about with respect to that [parcel] [ph] that you guys were I think one of two finalists for north of San Fran. I forgot the name of the town, but if you could sort of comment on what you are thinking about the prospects for that. 
Jon Jaffe: Steve, it’s Jon Jaffe. We are - that’s Concord Naval Station and we are still one of the two finalist; that decision won’t be made probably until September by the City Council. 
Stuart Miller: And then going back to the other expenses on the Joint venture line Steve, we did have some start-up expenses with the shipyard community, as we are just at the very beginning of that, and that was the bulk of the offset and that’s something that you are just seeing at the beginning of that community as deliveries start to kick in later this year, we don’t expect that to continue. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mr. Stephen East with ISI. Sir you line is now open.
Stephen East: If we looked at just sort of following on with your ancillary businesses, Stuart if you wouldn’t mind walking us through, you talked about the back half of this year, but as you look at ’16 with your businesses, what type of cadence do you get out of apartment sales, land sales coming from your JVs. And what do you still need to do to ultimately monetize Rialto. What type of work do you have left there to recognize some value out of it?
Stuart Miller: Steve, I highlighted at the beginning of this year, as we came in to this year that 2015 would be a significant statement year for the ancillary businesses, and in each one of them we are seeing significant moves towards maturity. I think at FivePoint, you are starting to see Hunters Point come online. I think Bruce highlighted we’ll see deliveries as we get through the back half of this year. We’ve seen a number of deals start to mature. As we’ve highlighted in prior quarters, and FivePoint is I think a group that most people have gone out and visited and been impressed with that progress. I think as it relates to our apartment communities, the fact that we are postponing two sales of apartments that we had expected to have this year is a distinct positive.  We have partners that are seeing the improvement in rental rates beyond our underwritten expectations and they’d like to hold on just a little bit longer. So we are going to benefit from rental income but not from the sales of those as we had anticipated. But we are going to see a recurring program of showing apartment communities as we go into 2016, and to sustain profitability there.  And then of course Rialto, I think the exciting part of Rialto is the successful investment of the first two funds along with the mezzanine fund at very attractive return levels that really marks a reputation in the asset management business that is going to lead right in to Fund III. We are not going to begin - we’ve begun our raise for Fund III, and we’ll start to see that to come to fruition in the back part of this year. Each of these programs is getting to a level of maturity, to a point where we can start to see not only monetization on the books of the company, but also strategic positioning for these companies for the future.  I can’t speak specifically about that, but I think that as I said at the beginning of the year, you’ll start to see those plans mature towards the back half of this year and in to 2016.
Stephen East: And then if you look at your land strategy and your land spend, you’ve talked a lot over the last year and a half about soft pivot. Can you give us an idea of where you are in that process, how you are thinking about the market over the next few years and what that implies for your land spend not only this year but as you look in to the next couple of years.
Stuart Miller: Yeah, we’ve spent a lot of time Steve on this soft pivot. A lot of it derives from lessons learned through the last downturn. As the management team and the corporate office and all the way through to the field, we’ve been very focused on shortening what we call, snout and tail, the beginning and ending part of each property that we’re purchasing.  And while we still see some tremendous opportunities to purchase strategic land parcels in the market, we were first to the market, we have a strategic advantage in that regard. The Fremont purchase that was highlighted by Bruce is a good example of that.  We’ve been very focused on bringing down the duration of land that we are bringing on our books unless we find a really unique opportunity as with the Fremont property. As we go through ’15, we are continuing our soft pivot as we’ve defined it. We are continuing to agitate around that, and we feel that in our primary homebuilding business, as we go in to 2016, we fully expect to be cash flow positive even while we grow, and that is in large part derived from the soft pivot.  We expect as we go forward, we are going to see a very strong program evolve, that is driven by shorter land positions and a strong drive to push efficiencies through the system. 
Stephen East: If I could ask you just quickly on that duration question, if you look at what you are buying today versus say you rewind two years ago, what would be the duration difference between those? 
Stuart Miller: Well you got to realize that we are looking at averages over a companywide foot print. So the Fremont is an example of a much longer duration property, but I think a very, very exciting purchase. And if you look across the platform our average duration of land is probably coming down by about a year, year and a half on the purchase side, as we sit right now today and as we look forward we think we will drive that duration down even further. 
Rick Beckwitt: Steve some of the steps that we are doing is contractually. When we were buying at pennies on the dollar several years back, we were prepared to take on balance sheet and close because we got such significant discount to market. Today rather than closing, right now, we are contracting to close a couple of years down and moving the land through the process. So we are benefiting from wholesale pricing today, but don’t necessarily need to come out of pocket for cash until later. 
Operator: Next question comes from Mr. Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Market. Sir your line is now open. 
Bob Wetenhall: Congratulations on a really strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the conversion rate in 1Q in the last quarter that just passed. It came in higher than our expectations, and if Bruce may be you could touch on, you mentioned rain has been an issue in terms of stopping deliveries at the schedule. How should we think about pace as we move in to the back part of the year. 
Bruce Gross: So Bob we’ve talked about in our central region that this is at the front-end of construction, there was water in parts of Texas and Colorado that delayed some of the start. So, we will catch up but initially we did lower the backlog conversion ration a little bit going in to Q3. But in total, if you look at deliveries for the year, we did increase them by 500 compared to the prior guidance. 
Bob Wetenhall: Got it, that’s helpful. And I wanted to ask Stuart and Rick a question, which inning of the cycle do you think we are in? You’ve been referencing the soft pivot strategy, so I am just trying to access how far you are in to this cycle at this point in your estimate. And with that being said, it sounds like some very positive commentary around Multifamily business. What’s the outlook for that in terms of retaining it or possibly spitting it out, and what kind of structures are you thinking about? Thanks very much and good luck.
Stuart Miller: Good, let me take that first Bob and then Rick will follow-up. But I think we’ve said pretty consistently, we think we are in the early stages of this recovery. This has been a slow, steady recovery that’s been defined by pretty shallow levels of production. And those shallow levels of production are creating short supply for a growing demand and we think that as we look ahead, this recovery remains fairly shallow sloped, but consistent for a number of years to come.  So we feel that we are still in the early innings of this recovery, and have been guiding our company and strategy accordingly. 
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah I think that actually goes for the Multifamily segment as well. The demand for rental properties today is off the chart. So we are seeing rent growth and lease-ups much faster than what we’ve under written, which is one of the reasons I would differ to the sales for two of the properties in the next couple of quarters.  As we look forward in to 2016 and beyond, we’ve got about 26 properties that have the ability to be sold and monetized during the next couple of years. That doesn’t even bring in to the question, the several billions dollars of pipeline that will be started over the next couple of years.  We couldn’t be prouder of the team in what we’ve done there and we are going to have to really see what size that thing can get to and what the best options are for our shareholders. 
Stuart Miller: At the end of the day just last comment on that. At the end of the day, as we’ve noted the first time home buyers just starting to come back in to the market place. They are going to start to come back and that’s going to have that upward ripple effect of affecting first time move-ups, second time move-up.  It really has an upward cascade in the market place, as the first time home buyers starts to come back to the market. This is going to be a slow process because of the mortgage market. Again this market has got a lot of legs. 
Operator: Next question comes from Mr. Michael Rehaut with JPMC. Sir your line is now open. 
Michael Rehaut: First question I had was just, may be if possible, a little more granularity on the Texas market. Aside from the floods you were able to put out similar results to last quarter, and just wanted to get a sense, just given that it still is a topic of interest among investors.  If you could give us a feel for, last quarter Houston was down 7, this quarter down 9. So a similar rate, if that was driven more by community count or sales pace. And then across the price points or demographic segments, which areas or parts of the market are stronger or weaker. 
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah, it’s Rick. I will tell you generally Texas is a strong market. Starting in Dallas the markets on fire, we’ve got excellent positions throughout the market and we are benefiting from the strong economy that’s in Dallas, and that’s really at our price point. We have a big entry level position there and we are benefiting from that. We’ve got move-up product and we are all over the price points. Austin and San Antonio are good solid markets, and we are well positioned there.  Houston which is in everyone’s focus, its’ about the same market as it was last quarter. If you look at our gross margins, our gross margins actually increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter. Sales were off about 9% this quarter, but we couldn’t sold more homes. We decided to focus on price as oppose to pace and we are going to continue to do that as the market evolves.  The entry level market in Houston is strong and getting stronger. When you get to the higher price points in Houston it gets a little bit softer, but that’s not all of the Houston market, it depends where you are. Closer to the oil corridor it’s a little softer. We are seeing huge traffic in the market at those price points. The people are cautious because they don’t know whether they will be laid off or not. 
Stuart Miller: But with all that said, the weather in Houston was interesting this quarter. It was a little rainy, some people heard on the news, and the rains absolutely shut down the market for a number of days during the quarter. There were days where our offices were actually shut down because there was not electricity and the floods were significant. That impacted as Bruce highlighted some of our early stage construction, later construction of course was dried in and we were able to complete those homes.  So as we look ahead and as Bruce highlighted, that will affect some of our conversion ratio in the next couple of quarters. But really pretty marginal impact in a fairly strong market. 
Michael Rehaut: Appreciate that, and obviously your other regions are doing pretty strong right across the board. So the diversity certainly kicks in as well. Second question, Bruce you had mentioned some of the different line items of guidance and I believer Multifamily you described the strategic position for hold-on.  I might have missed it but, could you update what the outlook now is for the Multifamily earnings for the full year, if you could just share that. 
Bruce Gross: For the full year, Mike I didn’t put a number out for the full year, but we’ll be close to breakeven possibly a slight of loss now that we’ve shifted two communities in to early 2016. But I think the key thing is that starting in Q4, we will now have a consistent program with this segment that will generate consistent profitability each quarter going forward.
Michael Rehaut: I appreciate that and of course understand the strategy there. But with that last statement though, there’s been talk around whether you would hold on to these apartments and more, just trying work up a lease-up and cash flow type of dynamic or continue to sell them out. You just mentioned that with Q4 with the sale of two building in Q4 now expected that would be the start of a more consistent cash flow generator.  So is there any shift there because I think over the last quarter or two, I think some of us have been hearing the possibility of maybe not selling as much as you were to expect or had initially expected in terms of actually selling the buildings but more holding on from a cash flow standpoint. Just want to know if there’s any, how you guys are thinking about that today.
Stuart Miller: We highlighted early on with our apartment program that our initial phase would be to define the business through a merchant build type program and that’s what you are seeing us move through right now is a focused merchant build program to establish a platform, to define it in the mind of investor, for people to understand what we were doing and how effective we can be. We are still going through that initial phase right now, but we’ve highlighted that there would be an evolution of this business as we go forward and as have achieved maturity. You are really asking the question that, how will this business mature as a business, what will its prospects be, how will we define a build and hold strategy.  And that’s really a question to be answered over the next quarters. I think that we are continuing to identify that merchant build program, but we’ve highlighted that through the course of this year. As this business achieves maturity, we think we’ll be able to bring clarity to how the future will be evolve for the business for this platform. And you can expect that over the next quarters, we will be able to bring that definition to you.  As it stands right now, I think that we are starting to identify some elements of certainty as to profitability in the early stage, and over the next quarters we’ll give better definition. With all of that said, I think that what you are seeing is a very credible program, in a well-timed addressing of the market condition as they exist, and we are extremely well positioned to bring that definition to this platform. So you will see that over the next couple of quarters. 
Operator: Next question comes from Mr. Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Your line is now open. 
Alan Ratner: Hey guys it’s actually Allen on for Ivy, so I guess this sure does apply here. Congratulations on the great quarter. Stuart you obviously spent a lot of time detailing the ancillary businesses and we hear the excitement there. If we look at the earnings today, I think 80%-80% plus of you earnings still comes from core homebuilding and in towns like here, you are still very bullish and optimistic about the outlook there.  So as we look forward two or three years, should we think about that share of earnings between homebuilding and ancillary should that look materially different or are you just kind of expecting these Multifamily Rialto to grow in line with homebuilding and the split between earnings still look pretty similar as we look at a couple of years. 
Stuart Miller: Yeah, so we’ve been very clear that our core business remains our homebuilding and financial services associated businesses. And those will continue to be at the core, the ancillary are opportunities for the future. I think that as we think about our business, our homebuilding business is strong, it has been strong, it’s assumed a leadership position in the homebuilding world, and I think that Jon and Rick has done an incredible job of building a platform that’s continuing to grow and to become more efficient as we go forward.  I think that the relationship in earnings, as we look ahead, I don’t know that I can identify exactly what the proportions will be. I think that one of the concerns about the ancillary businesses is that they can tend to be somewhat lumpy in the way that their earnings are presented, and they are not easily modeled.  And because of that I am not easily able to model what the relationship in earnings will be as we go forward. But as homebuilding continues to grow, we think that the ancillaries are going to grow also, and we can’t really lay out exactly what those proportions will be. 
Alan Ratner: Got it. I appreciate that. And a follow-up to your comments on the cash flow and in times like, I don’t know, I think ’16 was the year where you expect homebuilding cash flow to start inflecting positively and for the company to be a consistent generator of cash for the next several years.  So as you think about the opportunities with that cash, how would you rank where that cash might go between deleveraging M&A, share buybacks, any other potential usage of that cash.
Stuart Miller: Well, we’ve talked about this in prior calls, so we do expect to be cash generator as we mature the business and those numbers should get bigger over time. We think that the opportunity to deleverage, to return cash to shareholders and to invest further in the platform that we’ve been growing are all equal consideration, and I think we’ll leave those considerations open for when the time comes.  But I think that you can expect that we have a balanced mindset and thinking about each of those opportunities and that’s how we’ll run the business.
Operator: Next question comes from Mr. Jade Rahmani with KBW. Sir your line is now open. 
Jade Rahmani: Wanted to ask about your views on consolidation in both the homebuilding sector as well as in Rialto business lines?
Rick Beckwitt: So on the homebuilding side; we did see the Ryland and Stan-Pac combination. Think positively at that. With regard to though and our views on consolidation, acquisition, it’s a tough go for us, because we are I think probably the best land acquisition machine out there.  And when you are buying companies today, you are buying land assets, and we had found that we are able to buy those assets through negotiations with sellers at a cheaper price than acquiring the company and paying the goodwill associated with the company.  We have continued to look at smaller acquisitions and you can and we’ll continue to do so. But with regards to the larger public companies don’t seem to pencil out for us today.
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. I would just add that as you look at our geographic landscape, we are well positioned to markets that we want to be in. So we don’t have the need to make an acquisitions to enter new markets or for immediately relative to deliveries. So we are very particular about looking at these opportunities and as Rick said really don’t find that they price very well. 
Stuart Miller: But listen at the same time, there’s an attraction to being part of a larger homebuilder, some of the smaller homebuilders might find that access to capital or [forging] these opportunities, I think that we are going to continue to see consolidation in the industry. There are likely to be larger scale combinations and may be some smaller ones. I think that positions us particularly well. If you ask traditionally about Rialto, I think that one of the most exciting parts of Rialto is that it has become a formidable force in asset management in deploying capital.  And the management team infrastructures that Rialto has created is not immediately apparent, but it presents itself as a very attractive combination, M&A kind of platform for a lot of opportunities out there, and we continue to hold Rialto up as an opportunity that can be defined in a lot of ways, not the least of which is through M&A.
Jade Rahmani: Last quarter I think you noted a single family rental community that you would open, I was wondering if you could give an update on that, and if you are seeing any indications positively or negatively towards that sector. 
Stuart Miller: Listen I think that it’s one of the more interesting programs that we have inside the company and in fact this past quarter Jon, Rick and myself jointly went out to review the progress on that community. It’s an unusual engagement. You would think that it’s kind of easy and normal to just build a rental single family community. It’s actually a different and unique animal. So we are going through some evaluation of how it’s working out. The immediate review that we’ve seen out there is that it’s pretty exciting opportunity for our company. It requires some additional thoughts, some messaging of the floor plans, the management program. But in a world where single family rental is becoming a more dominant theme and the scattered single family acquirers have shown some metrics that are interesting but nonetheless, the management component is complicated. This single family rental community is really very exciting to us. We continue to look at it, continue to experiment with it, and we are probably going to launch another one or two as part of our valuation as we go forward.
Operator: And your next question comes from Mr. Buck Horne with Raymond James. Sir your line is now open. 
Buck Horne: Can you give us a little bit of a color on the monthly progression of the order trend, just as we move through the quarter any comments also you might be able to willing to share on June so far. I guess I am just wondering if we saw any impacts from higher rates caught through the month of May, any signs that higher may uphold some fin feathers in to the market just to get the front of the rate move. 
Jon Jaffe: Hi, this is Jon. We saw a pretty steady activity at our communities throughout the progression of the quarter. Month-over-month they were relatively balanced, so we didn’t see any big swing as commented earlier, just a very healthy spring selling season with strong activity in Florida, California and the part of Pacific Northwest and then very good activity in the rest of our states.  Didn’t really see any impact from the mortgage adjustment in rates as we went through the month of May, and it’s typical we don’t comment on the current quarter activity.
Buck Horne: Okay, fair enough. And relating to the mortgage market, we had a recent announcement from the CFPB that they were going to postpone changes on or implementation of the [TRS] move until early October. But that’s still on the horizon. How do you guys gauge the potential for any market disruption related to those changes on documentation and closing procedures. How well do you guys think buyers are prepared for that and what impact do you think might happen as a result of those changes? 
Bruce Gross: Well as you Buck, we are capturing 82% right now of our home buying customers within our mortgage company. So as you look at that population we feel very comfortable that our team is going to be putting through the change, testing it, be ready and we are very comfortable that we’ll be in good shape.  The question is for the remaining percentage whether a smaller mortgage companies or others that have to sell a home, that’s just a question that we’ll have to wait and see if there is any impact there.  Internally of course we are focused on making sure that we are not as backend loaded in the last few days of a quarter or a month, and trying to be proactive to accelerate that so there is minimal disruption even if some of the other mortgage companies have some issues. 
Stuart Miller: Let me add to that and say that you might or might not know or the investor world might or might not know that Bruce has directly - has been kind of running the dual position of being Chief Financial Officer and running our Financial Services Group. We’ve always had our Financial Services Group run up through our Chief Financial Officer.  But it’s more significant today because this is a rough and tumble mortgage market that is defined by a regulatory environment that has a lot of laws of unintended consequences coming through. And the new legislation, the new regulations that will come in to affect in October will have some ripple effect.  We are all over this and Bruce has been heavily focused on thinking through the nuance changes that will come in to the market in anticipation of some minor disruptions. We’ve been fortifying our mortgage company; I think you have seen it in the results from the numbers. But behind the scenes in the operations of our mortgage business, we recognize that there is potential for disruption and we are trying to stay ahead of the curve.  So we are going to have to wait and see exactly how the implementation comes forward, but we think that we are doing a lot of anticipatory work to really mute any negative impact that can come through in the back half of the year. 
Buck Horne: Thank you. Very helpful guys. Congratulations. 
Stuart Miller: Last question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Ms. Susan Maklari with UBS. Ma’am you may proceed.
Susan Maklari: Just building on the last [specific][ph] point, do you think longer term this could sort of change the overall competitive landscape, and perhaps do that such that it favors the larger builders just given your resources and abilities to help buyers with the complexity.
Stuart Miller: As I noted, there are a lot of unintended consequences embedded in some of this legislation or regulation I should say. I think in many of the instances the consequences are that larger players are benefitted and the larger player’s ability to adjust, to adapt and to spend the dollars to be ahead of some of the regulatory changes works to the benefit. We certainly think. And given the amount of focus that Bruce has put on our Financial Services Group, and preparation for the regulatory changes, I think it does advantage us and thus flat the playing field.  I think the smaller homebuilders have had difficulty getting up running and engaged in a capital constrained market that has favored larger builders. They’ve had more difficulty accessing land. I think given the fact that we have a large mortgage subsidiary that’s able to do a large portion of our business versus a smaller builder that might have to depend on outside lenders. I think it does additionally slant the table in the larger builders favor. 
Jon Jaffe: Susan this is Jon, I will just add to Stuart’s comment that the mortgage process today is very invasive, very frustrating for the homebuyer, and the close working relationship that you are hearing and Stuart and Bruce described between homebuilding operations and mortgage company ready to sell takes a much better customer experience.  We track this and we see this in our surveys of our customers, and I think it will result in better referral rates for us and achieving a higher level of capture of more markets as compared to our smaller competitors. 
Susan Maklari: Okay. Great, that’s very helpful. And then in terms of the labor or material side of things, you noted it was up about 7% kind of in line with what you saw in the first quarter. As we look at the back half of the year. I know you’ve been doing [stunts] on some worth to try in. Get some benefits coming through, given the commodity (inaudible)? How should we think about that relative to some of the offset that you’ve been seeing? 
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. There’s continued pressure, we see it more on the labor side, perhaps than the material side in today’s world especially as start between single family and Multifamily pickup. And so some areas from framing and drywall, masonry, you see pressure there.  So I think we will continue as an industry to seek pressure on that. So you will see some level price increase as we move forward, and we do love to take advantage of every opportunity whether it’s in lumber, we borrow different material to find moments and time to lock in some pricing to offset that.  So I think we’ll see that percentage increase sort of slowly moderate down, but I think you should expect to see some continued pressure as we move forward. 
Stuart Miller: Alright, let’s call it there, and look I hope that you are hearing our answers and our tone. We are enthusiastic about our business. Our core homebuilding business and Financial Services Group are well positioned to continue to post strong results as we go forward. We are enthusiastic about positioning the maturity of our ancillary businesses and look forward to continuing to update you on future quarters as to our progress and to our strategy going forward. Thank you for joining.
Operator: Thank you Sir. And that concludes today’s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

And we'd like to request that during Q&A, as always each person, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. So, let me go ahead and begin and I'll begin by saying that, of course, we're very pleased to report another quarter of performance for Lennar with each of our major segments performing as expected. In spite of some very difficult weather conditions in various parts of the country that have limited both sales and pushed back production, our first quarter results demonstrate that Lennar is very well positioned to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions and we continue to execute our balanced operating strategy. Consistent with our prior conference call messages, we continue to believe that we are still in the early stages of a protracted, slower-than-history-would-suggest housing recovery, and an early read from this year's spring selling season suggest that the market is continuing to improve at a very steady pace. This recovery continues to be driven forward by a strong backlog of pent-up demand for housing that is constrained by the mortgage market. Pent-up demand is derived from a now multi-year production deficit that is continuing to grow even at current production levels. At the same time, volume growth has been constrained by overly conservative lending standards, a regulatory environment that discourages mortgage lending and a negative consumer bias overhang against homeownership. Accordingly, we've seen and continue to see outsized improvement in the rental market in terms of low vacancies and higher rental rates. This trend, of course, has benefited our multifamily strategy rather dramatically, but also sets the stage for further improvement in the for-sale market as new households looking for a place to live compare monthly payments. While the relationship between pent-up demand, rental rates and mortgage availability continues to direct the housing market, it's becoming more apparent that the mortgage market is loosening incrementally with time and enabling more demand to be realized as household formation begins to return to more normalized levels. We have believed and we continue to believe that the downside in the housing market is very limited and the upside is very significant. We believe that the market is downside supported by the many years of production deficits that have yielded a limited supply of both rental and for-sale housing in the country. Any pullback in the housing market would be short-lived as there's a need for shelter across the country and there's very little inventory, and almost no likelihood of mortgage foreclosures given the stringent underwriting standards of the past years. And while demand has remained constrained by impaired consumer psychology, burdensome mortgage underwriting standards and banking regulations, buyers have continued to steady return to homeownership as the market opens up, driven by low interest rates, defining lower monthly payments versus the cost realities of a higher price and undersupplied rental market. The recent program changes by FHFA and HUD aimed at bringing buyers back to the market with the consumers' stimulus provided by lower gas prices and employment and wages slowly mending and with lower interest rates driving greater affordability, and with that multi-year deficit in production, the upside in housing continues to seem very large. Even with the ongoing questions raised about markets like Houston, given the sharp drop in oil prices, there are strong countercurrents to act as partial offsets. Lower gasoline prices and growing consumer confidence are netting an overall stronger market condition to pick up some of the pullback from the oil complex. At 1 million homes of multifamily and single-family production per year, we are continuing to undersupply the demographic needs of the country and this will have to be made up. The shallow slope of this recovery likely provides a steady backdrop for market share expansion in fragmented industry and an extended recovery for those like Lennar who are able to participate by leveraging a strong capital base. I would suggest that this continues to be a very healthy environment for well-capitalized national builders and for our company in particular. Our results for the first quarter reflect our success in positioning our company across the platform, and I'll let Bruce now give you the detail.
Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter increased 47% on a 21% increase in revenues. Revenues from home sales increased 23% in the first quarter, driven by a 20% increase in wholly-owned deliveries and a 3% year-over-year increase in average selling price to $326,000. Our gross margin on home sales in the first quarter was 23.1%. Just as a reminder, I highlighted in our fourth quarter conference call that our gross margin percentage is expected to be 24% for the full year in 2015, and the first quarter is seasonably the lowest. This quarter was in line with our expectation and we are still on track with our goal of 24% gross margin for the full year. The prior year's gross margin percent of 25.1% included a $5.5 million benefit relating to insurance settlement, which benefited the gross margin percent in the prior year by 50 basis points. Sales incentives declined sequentially to 6.3% from 6.6% in the fourth quarter, while being flat with last year. The gross margin decline year-over-year was also due to a moderation in pricing power, at the same time as labor, material, and land costs increased. Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 6.6% to approximately $50 per square foot, but are flat sequentially with the fourth quarter. This flattening represents a focused effort of reducing cost due to commodity declines primarily in copper and steel. We will continue to focus on cost reductions, including those related with petroleum-based products and lumber. However, we are still seeing offsetting labor and manufacturing pressures. We also saw an increase in cost for manufacturers to comply with stricter environmental regulations, as well as the shortage of transportation in the trucking industry. SG&A improved 40 basis points year-over-year and approximately 30 basis points of that improvement was due to a reduction in insurance reserves. We have also recognized operating leverage on our corporate G&A line, which improves 10 basis points to 2.7% as a percent of total revenues. Gross profits on land sales totaled $12.1 million for the quarter versus $16.1 million in the prior year. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated subs was $28.9 million in the first quarter as previously highlighted. This was all driven by El Toro joint venture, selling in 14 neighborhoods, totaling 921 home sites in the next section of El Toro. Lennar will build on four of the 14 neighborhoods, and therefore Lennar's profit of $31.3 million only includes the portion related to the 600 home sites sold to third parties. Other income was up to $6.3 million this quarter from $2.9 million in the prior year. The increase was due to a club sale at one of our communities that netted a $6.5 million gain. Other interest expense declined year-over-year from $12.7 million in the prior year to $4.1 million in the current year as we continue to open communities and increase the qualifying assets eligible for capitalization. This quarter, we opened 58 new communities to end the quarter with a net of 626 active communities, which is up 14% over the prior year. Our new order dollar value was up 25% and our sales pace was flat year-over-year at 2.8 sales per community per month. In the first quarter, we purchased 4,200 home sites totaling $421 million versus $505 million in the prior year's quarter. This is consistent with our strategy articulated last year to softly pivot from longer-term land parcels to shorter-term deals. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 163,000 home sites, of which 133,000 are owned. Our Financial Services business segment had strong results, with operating earnings increasing to $15.5 million from $4.5 million in the prior year. Mortgage pre-tax income increased to $14 million from $6.5 million in the prior year. The increased mortgage earnings were due to higher volume, as mortgage originations increased 84% to $1.6 billion from $886 million in the prior year. The increased volume resulted from a mini-refinancing in the first quarter as well as more home closings by Lennar and a higher capture rate of Lennar homebuyers. The capture rate of Lennar homebuyers improved to 79% this quarter from 75% in prior year. In 2014, our mortgage subsidiary expanded its retail channel with the acquisition of Pinnacle Mortgage and by opening branches on the East Coast, and this expansion positioned us well to capitalize on the refinance activity that we did see in the first quarter. Although we don't expect the refinance activity to continue at the same pace as the first quarter, we are well positioned to capture purchase business as the housing recovery continues. Our title company's profit increased to $2.1 million in the quarter from a loss of $1.6 million in the prior year. And this is primarily due to higher volume and benefits from strategic initiatives, including closing less productive branches over the past year. Our title team continues to focus on maximizing the title opportunities with our ancillary businesses. Turning to Rialto, the Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $4.6 million compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of non-controlling interests. The composition of Rialto's $4.6 million of operating earnings by the three types of investment before G&A and Rialto interest expense are as follows. First, the investment management business contributed $24.4 million of earnings, which includes $2.7 million of equity in earnings from real estate funds and $21.7 million of management fees and other, which included $6.5 million of a carried interest distribution from Rialto real estate funds, and that's to cover the income tax obligation resulting from the allocations of taxable income to Rialto. The carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I under a hypothetical liquidation now stands at $105 million, and that's a footnote which we don't book until we actually receive the cash. Second, Rialto Mortgage Finance contributed $318 million of commercial loans into two securitizations, resulting in earnings of $9.7 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses. And then third, our direct investments had a loss of $2 million for the quarter. And again, we expect most of these direct investments to be monetized by the end of next year. Rialto's G&A and other expenses were $20.7 million for the quarter. And interest expense excluding our warehouse lines was $6.8 million. Our Multifamily operations have grown to over 200 associates in regional offices nationwide. We currently have seasoned professionals in divisional offices in Atlanta, Boca Raton, Charlotte, Washington DC, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Orange County, San Francisco, and Seattle. We ended the quarter with 24 projects under construction, two of which are in lease-up, totaling over 6,600 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $1.6 billion. We also have one completed fully leased and operating student housing community that serves the students attending the University of Texas at Austin. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $5.5 billion and over 20,000 apartments. In the first quarter, we had an operating loss of approximately $5.7 million. And despite this loss, we still expect to be profitable for the full year, benefiting from the sale of about five communities in the last six months of the fiscal year. As we have discussed in the past, we have been merchant building our apartment communities with third-party institutional capital on a deal-by-deal basis. We are continuing to explore potential financing structures that would allow us to hold our completed and leased apartment communities as a portfolio to capture the recurring income stream from this portfolio. Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong in the quarter, as our Homebuilding cash balance ended the quarter at $584 million. We had $250 million outstanding under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. And our leverage improved by 60 basis points year over year as our Homebuilding net debt-to-total capital was reduced to 47.9%. During the quarter, we added on $250 million to our 4.5% senior notes due November 2019 at a yield of 4.4%, and we continue to reduce our borrowing rate as the company's financial condition strengthens. We grew stockholders' equity to approximately $5 billion at quarter end, and our book value per share increased to $24.13. And then last, I'd like to summarize what was said on the call regarding goals for 2015 and an update from what we said on our fourth quarter conference call. One, deliveries. We're still on track to deliver between 23,500 and 24,000 homes for 2015. The severe weather conditions in the first quarter have delayed some construction activities, which will slightly reduce our backlog conversion ratio to 80% for Q2 and 80% to 85% for Q3. But we will pick that up and we are increasing our fourth quarter conversion ratio to 95% to 100%. Second, gross margin. We still expect our gross margins in 2015 to average 24% for the full year, and the gross margins will vary throughout the year depending on product mix with the fourth quarter still expected to be the highest gross margin percent for the year. Third, we still expect to see 15 basis points to 25 basis points of potential improvement for the SG&A on corporate G&A combined categories. Fourth, Financial Services. We are increasing our goal for this segment due to the strong refinance environment as the start of the year. We now expect to earn $95 million to $100 million for the full year, but remaining quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to the proportions of last year. Rialto, we still expect a range of profits between $30 million and $40 million for the year and it's heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. Multifamily, we are still expecting five buildings to be sold in 2015, all expected in the second half of the year with the 2015 profit still expected to be between $15 million and $18 million and that will depend on the timing of these building sales. Joint venture and land sales, we still expect to have $10 million of joint venture profit in the second quarter and this is primarily due to our share of the profit from the El Toro land sale to Broadcom which did close in the month of March and that's on track, as we said, last quarter. There are no other significant transactions in Q3 or Q4 in the JVs and we're on track with approximately $25 million of wholly-owned land sale profit for the year with the bulk of the remaining land profit to be in our fourth quarter. Our tax rate for 2015 is now expected to do in the mid 34% range and our community count is on target to hit 675 by the end of year. So we are well positioned for this year to deliver strong top line and bottom line growth throughout the year. And with that, let me turn it over for questions.
Operator: Our first question is from Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, congratulations everyone. Great start to the spring selling season. I just wanted to ask, your average selling prices on new orders were up 5.5%, which we thought was really good. I wanted to ask you. How are you thinking about balancing price and pace in the current environment? Are you seeing pricing power and how much pushback are you getting from buyers?
Richard Beckwitt - President: Hi, Bob. It's Rick, Rick Beckwitt. We're still continuing to balance price and pace specifically in a couple of markets where demand is really strong and we've got excellent land positions. As you look at the pricing increase year-over-year, a component of that was mix. We had a higher level of deliveries coming from California, some of it was just pure price increase so it's a balance.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And with the order growth that you're seeing right now, and just thinking about Bruce's gross margin guidance of 24%, do you expect the majority of the expansion in gross margin to come from volume-driven operating leverage or is that going to be more a reflection of the growth in average selling prices you're seeing? Thanks very much and good luck.
Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: It's going to be driven by the mix, Bob. It's not going to be driven primarily by average selling price increases.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, thanks very much.
Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: We get a higher a level of field absorption, so some of it is volume-driven, Bob.
Operator: Next question from Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Anyone there? All right. We ought to go onto the next one.
Operator: Michael Rehaut, JPMC. Your line is open.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats on a solid quarter. First question I had was on Houston. Did the 7% decline in orders – obviously, you still had a great overall order growth number, also noticed the 4% drop in Southeast Florida. Perhaps you could talk about those two regions in terms of was that more community count-driven. We were just through Houston and saw a little bit of perhaps the slower pace in February, but really did very, very much by sub-market and positioning, et cetera. But any comments on Houston and for that matter, Southeast Florida, what was driving the order trends during the quarter would be helpful?
Richard Beckwitt - President: Okay, this is Rick. First, let's talk about Houston because I know it's in everybody's thoughts right now. I'd tell you that across the board, we had good traffic in all price points. Definitely stronger traffic and absorption at the sub $350,000 price point; real, real strong between $200,000 and $300,000. As you got above the $400,000, $500,000 price point, it's slowing down. Traffic is still strong. The buyers there are just more cautious in pulling the trigger on the sales side. But we really think that the Houston market is a strong market. We decided not to chase prices down and focus more on gross margin in Houston. We're very positive on the Houston market. With regard to Southeast Florida, that really is just the timing of communities. If you look at the average sales price, it was up 9% year-over-year in the market that we chose to focus more on pricing power there as opposed to sales absorptions.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. No, that's very helpful. I guess just second question on pricing and incentives, broadly speaking. We've heard that the spring is off generally speaking to a solid start; obviously your comments echo that. At the same time, given how 2014 for many builders was a little bit of an uneven year, I think at this point from what we understand, builders are still a little bit hesitant to exact any material price increases or dial back incentives. But perhaps as the spring progresses, if there's still kind of a solid pace that you could see that a little bit more into April and May, is that kind of similar to what you're seeing in the market and an approach that you might take if you continue to see overall – the solid start to the spring progress?
Richard Beckwitt - President: Mike, I go back to the scene that I have advanced pretty much quarter-after-quarter. And now for the past few years, and that is that we're operating in this kind of narrow channel of improvement that's defined by a production deficit across the country and constrained mortgage availability. So, you have demand pushing up, you've got constraint pushing down, and all of this is happening with inventories very, very tight across the country, both on the existing and the new home and the rental side of the equation. So the market condition generally has been choppy. It's been moving inside the channel, a little bit up, a little bit down and you're seeing some of that. And of course, as you go through the first quarter, you've seen some rather severe weather conditions in a number of parts of country that have really limited the ability of buyers to get out of their home and go look for a home if they're even inclined to. And you've not just seen that in the Northeast where it's been kind of most aggressively articulated. It's in Dallas. It's been in Atlanta. We've had weather conditions in a number of places across the country. So even in the context of some constraining weather conditions, the market is still presenting itself and early signs of the spring are showing themselves to be steady improvement in the marketplace continuing along that trajectory of an improving, recovering housing market constrained by the mortgage market, limited inventories and still primarily defined by a production deficit that has been growing over the years that is pushing where pent-up demand is pushing production upward. We think this is a terrific tailwind for the industry and as we look ahead to the spring selling season, we're going to be balancing price and pace as we have done in a very methodical way. I think most builders will be doing the same. And while the market might move up, might move down a little bit, we see steady improvement.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks so much, guys.
Operator: Next question from Haendel St. Juste, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Sorry about the technical difficulties earlier.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So wanted to ask about the absorption pace. How did that spread throughout quarter and how is it turning currently? And can you talk about what buyer segments are currently driving the orders and the absorption growth?
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me ask Jon to lay in on that.
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: Well, as you would expect in our first quarter, we saw sequentially for the months order pace improve as you move from December, January into February. And then as we've been saying, it's really submarket by submarket "saw" the strongest absorption improvements in the coastal markets, particularly places like California, parts of Florida up into the Carolinas, which is what we expect as we've seen looking backwards in this recovery as the coastal market seem to be outperforming from an absorption standpoint.
Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, I appreciate that. On the deliveries beat, was that just driven by higher demand for spec or the platform just running better maybe perhaps than you expected during the quarter?
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a combination of the two.
Haendel E. St. Juste - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Next question from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates, your line is open.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Good morning. It's Alan on for Ivy, and congrats on the quarter. First question, Rick, I was hoping maybe just to follow up quickly on the Southeast Florida orders there. The order pace this quarter was well below where you've been running in the back half of last year. And you mentioned the timing effect there from some communities. If we look at the trends through 2014, it looks like you had a similar drop-off in 1Q, and then activity ramps pretty significantly through the remainder of the year there. So as you think about the pipeline of community openings in that market specifically, should we expect to see a similar trend this year, or is this kind of first quarter run rate just based on your pipeline a more realistic run rate through the year?
Richard Beckwitt - President: Some of it's going to be – it's really dependent on when we can get the big communities open. We went through some rather large, high productive communities last year, and we've got similar battleships opening this year throughout Southeast Florida. Unfortunately, right now there, we're getting the models open, getting the monuments, the entries opened, and it's going to be probably a couple of quarters until that pace picks back up. But as we move into 2016, you'll see a lot of activity coming from Southeast Florida. It will still be a really good year, high margins, just a little bit on the flat side for the year.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it, I appreciate that color. And second, Stuart, there have been some articles written about a community opened recently in Nevada geared towards rentals on the single-family side. So I was curious if you can give some color there about what the company strategy is, whether this is a one-off, or whether that's a business you're looking to get into.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, as you know, we started years ago focusing on the rental component of the market, recognizing that the mortgage constraint would play a big role in the way that the housing market would recover. Frankly, we didn't anticipate that the regulatory environment would constrain the mortgage market as much as it has. And as the market has presented, we've continued to grow a rather sizable apartment rental business. We've built a platform that, as Bruce articulated, is very large across our geography. And we're not only pleased with the $5.5 billion pipeline that we've put together, and we think that even to our underwriting we're seeing upside just based on low vacancies and high rental rates. The inability of the American family to access the mortgage market is really developing an appetite for single-family product, though it might have to be realized in a rental format. And so we are experimenting with that format as a hybrid between our for-sale and our multifamily apartment community program. And it has received a little bit of publicity, but we are building our first such community to see what the acceptance is in the marketplace. Whether it becomes part of a trend, whether it becomes part of a program going forward, we have yet to see. But as is typical with us, we are innovative. We like to think of ourselves as thinking a little bit outside the box, forward thinking, and we think that this community could be representative of somewhat of a trend in the country, and we'll wait and see. From an upside standpoint, we look at the community as a rental opportunity that can be very interesting. On the downside, if the rental concept doesn't work as well as we'd like, we can always convert to a for-sale platform. So it's really right in our wheelhouse to be working on this, and we think it presents a really unique and interesting opportunity for the future.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Sounds exciting, good luck.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Next question from Stephen East, Evercore ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Stuart, you've talked a few times about mortgages, et cetera. I guess a compound question here. One, who's really providing the mortgages as you look across the country? Is this coming from the bigger guys in the world or is it just the smaller guys and non-banks? And then if you just look at what you think the market – what type of growth rates the market could support this year, say, over the next 12 months or so, what's limiting factor? Is it the mortgage availability, or would it be more on the land or labor? How do you all look at it right now?
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: First of all, as it relates to the mortgage market, Stephen, there's clearly somewhat of a shift going on. The traditional banking world is really constrained in its view of the mortgage market and the regulatory environment. But really that regulatory environment spreads or is equally applied across the mortgage platform. Even if you're an unconventional lender, you have to look at the regulations around mortgage origination and some of the punitive constraints of the environment as a limiting factor. And it's not just at the origination point; it's all the way through to the servicing platforms out there. So the mortgage market, even though we're seeing that originations are finding their way across smaller lenders and less traditional lenders in the market at large, it doesn't move the needle dramatically to see the shift from big banks to others in terms of healing the mortgage market. It's more about the regulatory environment softening, the punitive side being softened and lenders just feeling their way through this kind of turbulent landscape. So I still view the mortgage landscape as the primary limiting factor. Now a secondary limiting factor, because we have been constrained in production, the land development machine has not reemerged in this housing recovery in full force. So it takes time to get land entitled. I keep going back to the fact that there is a land shortage, and that means entitled developed land is in short supply. So if you see an uptick in the marketplace, land will continue to be a constraining factor. And then the question of materials and labor, I think they're subsidiary questions. I think to the extent that demand reveals itself, labor can be sourced with higher wages, materials. There are clearly some constraints on the trucking side and maybe the import markets are little bit more complicated. But I think your primary constraining factors are the mortgage market number one, and then land number two.
Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI: Okay, thanks. And then the other question I had, if you look at really two things. One, your apartment sales that you got coming in the back half, if you could, give us a rundown on location and what you think the general cap rate will be. And then what you think your cash flows – are you cash flow neutral this year? Do you turn positive in 2016 with the soft pivot, and how much of it would probably revolve around the sales of the apartments?
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: First of all, Steve, I want to recognize that you're asking compound questions, which really kind of defeat the policy of one question.
Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI: I've got to squeeze them in somehow.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's right. So in terms of apartment sales, I'm not going to give specific cap rates and sale numbers. What I will say is that our performance in the apartment segment is defined by low vacancies, higher rental rates than we had originally underwritten. And as we look to sell apartment communities, just remember that we are in partnership in those apartment community, so we don't have the complete unilateral ability to define a sell and define the exact timing of that sale. So this is going to unfold and we've been very cautious about describing the parameters around how sales will actually happen because we recognize it's an imperfect landscape right now. And of course, in order to model it, you who do will analyze what we're trying to do. We're looking for some certainty as to how many and what the cap rate is and what the profitability will be. And we've realized there is a little tug and pull there. We're trying to give you some general parameters recognizing that the specifics are going to define themselves at that time. And as we go through some of our sales, we'll start to develop some more specific parameters, which will be helpful to you when we get into 2016.
Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI: Okay, fair enough.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And then the second part of that compound question was?
Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI: Just looking at your cash flows for this year and next year.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Bruce, do you want to talk about that?
Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Sure. So as we've been saying, we think 2015, we are going through the soft pivot. So depending on some of the timing of some of the land acquisitions, we're getting to a point where by the end of this year, we think we'll be in a position of turning positive cash flow and into next year. And most of that is driven by the soft pivot because the ancillary businesses as you go through this year are pretty much self-funding. We're putting a little bit more into Multifamily this year. But we expect as we get into 2016, those businesses will be returning cash and self-funding. So the soft pivot is what's going to be driving us to get to cash flow positive as we get towards the end of this year.
Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI: All right, I appreciate all the help. Thank you, guys.
Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Next question from Stephen Kim, Barclays. Your line is open.
James Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. This is actually Trey on for Steve. Going back and touch a little bit on the mortgage market that you guys have talked about a few times, you actually, early May, published some FICO and DTI data regarding February with both tightening on the margin. Do you believe this is representative of what's currently going on in the underwriting market or do you think this is more a reflection of people walking through the door? And are you seeing similar trends coming from your customers?
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I saw that. I don't know really what to make of it. It seems fairly – it seems that the data that's reported is really kind of it's within a range. I don't know that we – I don't know that I could see a trend from that. It seems to us as we look at our book of business that still – that the mortgage market is opening at a margin. And the fact that FICO scores might move a little bit one way or another I think is all part of that process of one step forward, two steps back, but gently improving as we go forward. So, I just don't know that I would read too much into that data.
James Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, thanks for that. Now, speaking to your ancillary businesses a little bit, could you talk about the recent departures at Rialto and what most excited you about that business? And also regarding FivePoint, what do you consider the timing for the next group of lot sales to be released there?
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Let me let Jeff talk about the departures and then we'll talk about FivePoint.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff - Chief Executive Officer, Rialto Capital Management: This is Jeff. And as far as the departures go, I think it could go probably a lot more for us than really what the price made a bigger deal of it than it really was at the end of the day. And we have about 400 folks in Rialto, the team that was – that left has already been replaced most of it, almost a 100% of it internally with a group of individuals that have been growing up in the business and actually been in the business even longer. So from that perspective, we're feeling really good about it in terms of where we are.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me just add to that. I think if you look at the markets in which Rialto operates, most of the participants are groups that have been homegrown here within the Lennar environment. Jeff and his senior management team are, I would say, the educators of the industry and I would say that we have the recipe here. Some of the ingredients sometimes leave the building, but we can replace the ingredients. And we have a great and stable program at Rialto that continues to move forward. I wouldn't read too much into the departure of any one or any few associates either in the Rialto platform or the Lennar platform and again, as Jeff said, I think the press made a lot of much ado about very little. Let me turn to Jon to answer the part about FivePoint.
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: Thanks, Stuart. We're very excited where FivePoint is positioned right now. Most of the activity is occurring at El Toro in Orange County. We reported sales have gone extremely well in the first phase which is virtually sold out now. We reported closing to builders of most of the villages in the second phase in our first quarter. The last two villages, we expect to close this quarter with the builders starting their models and production this quarter and a grand opening sometime mid-summer. We also just closed at the beginning of this quarter commercial transaction with Broadcom that we're very excited about bringing a commercial component on into El Toro. And we expect the next major section of El Toro to come to market at the end of the year, probably will fall into our first quarter for fiscal 2016. And activity continues to go very strongly up in San Francisco at Hunters Point, the shipyard. We're sold out of our first buildings there, first 88 homes and we'll be releasing our next homes in the coming couple months and continue to start more construction at that site, as well as we announced our large joint venture with Macerich to develop a large retail mall there, which has spurred a lot of interest from other commercial players in our activity there. And we did commence deconstruction of Candlestick Park this quarter and we'll have that completed by next quarter.
James Morrish - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks, guys. It's very helpful.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay.
Operator: Next question from Jade Rahmani, KBW. Your line is open.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Rialto, I wanted to also ask about if you could provide an update on your thinking regarding what you might eventually choose to do with that business, whether it'd be spin-off sale or combination with another entity. It seems that in the current regulatory environment with the Basel III, increased capital requirements for banks in the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules that go into effect late next year. Non-banking platforms like Rialto should stand to benefit and also should see not only market growth opportunities, but interest from other players. So want to see if you could an update on how you're thinking about it.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, listen. Jade, part of our thesis with Rialto was, as we've grown it, has definitely marched along the lines of recognizing that the constraints around the banking industry presented a distinct opportunity for our Rialto platform, and we're pretty enthusiastic about the prospects for future. To the first part of your question, we have built Rialto as distinct from when we built LNR in the 1990s. We built Rialto as a segregated segment with a full complement of management team that was disentangled from the Lennar platform. It was designed to be built with full optionality. As we developed maturity in the business, we would have the ability to either spin to IPO, to combine, to sell, to do any number of things. As we look at Rialto today, given its current maturity, given the prospects for its future, it's a platform that we continue to like having the ability to hold within the company and wait for the right next move to present itself. So we don't feel any urgency in doing something immediately with that segment. We think that it continues its progression of coming right along with a tremendous opportunity set in front of it. And there will be an intersection of a right next move for Rialto as we continue to grow it and as the market continues to ripen and present itself. So think about it in terms of having an excellent operating platform with perfect optionality to be able to realize its maximum value as the market recognizes what its potential is. And that's exactly how we think about it, and we couldn't be happier with the way it's positioned.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great, thanks for that. Just a small follow-up on the risk retention rules. Since Rialto is buying B-pieces at this point through funds, I just wanted to get clarification on whether that would meet the risk retention requirements.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff - Chief Executive Officer, Rialto Capital Management: Jade, it's Jeff. As we understand them, it would. It clearly would. And we believe that in terms of how we're positioned and in terms of the types of investors that we have, we're expecting that to be an advantage for us as we go forward and when the rules actually begin from there.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think that like the mortgage, the residential mortgage environment, risk retention rules across all asset classes are continuing to evolve. I think the initial intent or the initial concept of risk retention proved to be a limiting factor to the evolution of markets. And in order to keep markets moving and working properly, those rules have had to morph. As we sit right now, we think we're a beneficiary of whatever those risk retention rules are because we have the unique ability to match up special servicing with the acquisition of the underlying collateral of the B-piece. And so however it evolves, we'll be compliant and we'll be a primary engine.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: Next question from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Hi, this is Joey Matthews on for Adam. My question is probably for Rick or Jon in regards to your mothballed asset strategy. You said last quarter you expect about 10% of your deliveries this year to be from those previously mothballed assets. I'm wondering what percentage of your deliveries in Q1 were from those previously mothballed assets and how any difficulties you're having developing that land to get it ready to open communities.
Richard Beckwitt - President: We're looking at the number right now, but my guess is it's somewhere around that 10% number.
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: Just a little below 10%, 8% to 10%.
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then...
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: And...
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Go ahead.
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: ...there are really no difficulties in bringing those online. We've been making sure that we're on top of keeping entitlements in place, land ready to go. So as the market recovers, they're in existing divisions. We're able to, we've got product in our portfolio and able to methodically bring those online.
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And since those are probably in B and C locations, I would guess. How have absorptions in those communities progressed this quarter?
Richard Beckwitt - President: Jon?
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: Consistent with the marketplace. Sometimes they're in B and C locations, sometimes a little bit better just depending on when they were acquired. We held on to mostly our better locations as we went through the liquidation of many of those assets in the downturn, particularly with our large transaction. So we're finding that they perform fairly consistently with other communities in those areas, and we're not experiencing any activity that are really in far outreaching areas. So I don't have any color on something that would be in a true tertiary market.
Joey Matthews - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, and why don't we go ahead and take our last question?
Operator: Your last question from Michael Dahl, Credit Suisse, your line is open.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thanks. I wanted to go back to – I think Rick made a comment earlier in response to a Houston comment and make sure we understood the context around it. You said you chose not to chase pricing down. Is that a comment relating to just your mix of communities not shifting towards the lower end, or competitively were you seeing more discounting in that market?
Richard Beckwitt - President: A lot of times when you have a bunch of builders in a market where there's a lot – there's headline oil everyday in the paper, some of the smaller, less capitalized builders get nervous with regard to what they do with inventory. We've taken the position that we've got great quality assets in the right locations, so there's no reason to adjust pricing just because other builders that maybe in tertiary areas are bringing their prices down. So we've just chosen to focus more on margin than on pace.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah.
Richard Beckwitt - President: That smoke should clear out at some point. And actually, we view it long term – medium term as an advantage for us because we're starting to see some of the land parcels that were under contract by other folks come back to the market or people walking away from deals. And as Stuart had said in the past, a lot of times distress or perceived distress is where we really excel.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay, that is helpful. Secondly, I think, Bruce, in some of your opening remarks, you made some references to focused efforts on some of the material costs. And I guess from manufacturers, you've kind of heard mix. Some are still staying hey, our feedstock cost hasn't really flowed through to us yet. So could you give any more color on just how those conversations are going and how much success you are having or expect?
Bruce E. Gross - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President: Let me turn it over to Jon to answer that one.
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question, please? I apologize.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): The question was around just efforts to reduce some of the input cost dependent materials that you guys use and how the conversations are going with manufacturers given some of them are still trying to claim lower feedstock hasn't flowed through to them yet.
Jonathan M. Jaffe - Chief Operating Officer & Vice President: From our vantage point, we're achieving success on one hand with manufacturers and then having headwinds on another side of the equation. The success has been with the drop in copper cost, steel cost that flow through the manufacturers. What's really been offsetting that is some new regulation that's occurred, particularly on the environmental front. So for example, the Department of Energy passed new regulation at the end of last year that require side-by-side refrigerator freezers to be 25% more efficient. So that requires them to use more the material in making the product. So we end up with an offset. We're really not seeing any cost savings, but we are seeing not the same increase what we would have seen just been their compliance with the new regulation. Seen the same thing with HVAC, windows, water heaters all subject to new regulation. So, we are – it's a daily focus for us. We work with the national manufacturers, with local suppliers, local trades to find every opportunity. Now, when you look at as a percentage of what we – of our build cost, copper, steel are not that bigger percentage. Lumber, which is a bigger percentage, we have seen that come down recently and do expect to see some benefit from that in our second, third and fourth quarters. But again, you have other cost such as concrete and drywall that continue to have some pressure on them.
Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you.
Stuart A. Miller - Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right, very good. Thanks, everyone, for joining. As I said before, we feel that the market is continuing to present itself as improving and we look forward to reconnecting at the end of our second quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does concluded the presentation. You may disconnect at this time.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
Stuart Miller: All right. Well, let me just jump in and begin then. This is Stuart Miller. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end update. This morning, I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer and Dave Collins, who you just heard from, Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Rick Beckwitt, our President and Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer, are here as well and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto. They are all going to join in for question-and-answer. As is customary on our conference call, I am going to begin with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and our operations and then Bruce is going to jump in with greater detail. As always, we will open up to Q&A and we would like to request that during Q&A, each person limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. So let me go ahead and begin and let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to report another very solid quarter of performance for Lennar with each of our major segments performing better than expected. Our fourth quarter and year-end results demonstrate that our company is very well positioned to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions and to continue to execute our carefully crafted and balanced operating strategy. Generally speaking, we continue to believe that we are still in the early stages of a protracted slow growth housing recovery. The recovery continues to be driven forward by increased pent-up demand derived from a now multiyear production deficit and the increasingly high monthly cost of rentals. At the same time, volume growth has been constrained by overly conservative lending standards, a regulatory environment that discourages mortgage lending by banks and a negative bias overhang against homeownership. Complicating matters, the housing recovery has been somewhat erratic as macroeconomic factors have continued to both positively and negatively affect that recovery. As I have said before, this market has continued a slow and steady recovery that is markedly different from past down cycle recoveries. I noted in our last conference call that history would suggest a more vertical recovery especially given the severity of the economic decline. This recovery has had a decidedly different trajectory as the slope of recovery has been shallow and the recovery has been choppy and volatile. While the reflection of the market has been confounding to many, we have had a very clear understanding that has informed our company strategy. Simply put, we believe and continue to believe that the downside in the housing market is very limited and the upside is very significant. We believe that the market is downside supported by many years of production deficits, which has yielded a limited supply of both rental and for-sale housing in the country. Any pullback in housing volume would be short-lived as there is a need for shelter in the country and there is very little inventory with almost no likelihood of mortgage foreclosures, given the stringent underwriting standards of the past years. And while demand has remained constrained by impaired consumer psychology, burdensome mortgage underwriting standards and banking regulations that discourage mortgage lending, buyers have been steadily returning to homeownership as the market opens up driven by the cost realities of a high priced and undersupplied rental market. With recent pronouncements by FHFA and HUD aimed at bringing buyers back to the market, with the consumer stimulus provided by lower gas prices, with employment and wages slowly mending, with lower interest rates driving greater affordability and with that multiyear deficit in production, the upside in housing remains ahead of us. Even with questions raised about markets like Houston, given the drop in oil prices and foreign purchasers, given the strong dollar, there are strong countercurrents to act as an offset. At a million homes of multifamily and single-family production per year, we are continuing to undersupply the longer-term needs of the country and this will have to be made up. The shallow slope of this recovery likely provides a steady backdrop for market share expansion in a fragmented industry and an extended recovery duration for those who are able to participate by leveraging a strong capital base. I would suggest that this is a very healthy environment for the well-capitalized national builders and for Lennar in particular. Our results for 2014 reflect our success in navigating this landscape and we believe that we are well positioned for strong results in 2015 and beyond. A combination of solid management execution of our articulated strategies and strategic investments in core assets combine to produce strong results and will enable continued industry-leading performance throughout next year. Homebuilding, of course, remains the primary driver of our company performance [indiscernible] that is driving this performance this quarter were job growth and encouraging dialogue regarding mortgage underwriting, while the headwinds remain a challenging mortgage approval process and aggressive competitor incentives. Lennar's execution strategy remain balancing price and pace on a community-by-community basis to maximize our results and continuing our soft pivot towards the slower growth and land-lighter program. The execution of this strategy produced 22% sales growth, 25.6% gross margin and a 16% operating margin. Our operating margin for the full year of 14.9% matches our company high from 2005. Our sales pace in the fourth quarter was three sales per community per month and this was flat with 2013 fourth quarter pace by 2.9 and still is not enough to drive the operating leverage that should come from increased absorption. Nevertheless, fourth quarter SG&A was 9.6% and a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our average sales price increased 7% year-over-year to $329,000. During the quarter, we opened 75 new communities and closed up [indiscernible] communities to end at 625 active communities or 16% year-over-year increase. Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 7% to $50 a square foot. This represents the slowing of the pace of cost increases from a 10% plus year-over-year run rate the past two years and that's before the recent fall of oil prices. With oil prices down, we should see cost and petroleum-based products such as roots single and asphalt come down as well as broader reductions from the overall positive impact of lower transportation costs. Additionally, the reduction in costs in copper and other commodities should add to cost reductions in the future. Remember, however, that increases are quick to be passed on while decreases are difficult and time-consuming to realize. With many of our competitors offering large incentives to drive sales, sales incentives grew 6.6% for the quarter compared to 6.3% last year and 5.8% last quarter. Our realtor expense was 2.8% of revenues compared to 2.5% last year. We continued to strategically use incentives and/or increased brokerage fees on specific communities where we thought the sales pace [indiscernible] selectively marketing more aggressively to both brokerage community and consumers on communities as needed. As we have noted before, our sales and margins continue to benefit from our Next Gen offering. For the quarter, our Next Gen product had a year-over-year growth rate of 38%. We now offer Next Gen plans in 205 communities in 14 of our 17 states, with an average sales price 23% above our company average. Our homebuilding operating results for 2014 really speak for themselves. As we look to 2015, while we expect to see some margin contraction due to competitive pressures and the inclusion of some additional legacy land assets in our product offering, our homebuilding operating platform is well positioned to continue to drive strong profitability for the company. Of course, complementing our homebuilding operations, our financial services segment continued to build its primary business alongside the homebuilder while continuing to also grow our retail platform. Bruce will talk more about our financial services progress which has had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $30.2 million, which is a 78% improvement over to $17 million last year. While our homebuilding and financial services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Our multifamily operation has grown to 157 associates and regional offices nationwide. We currently have seasoned professional and division offices in Atlanta, Boca Raton, Charlotte, Washington DC, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Orange County, San Francisco and Seattle. We ended the year with 22 apartment communities under construction, three of which are in lease up, totaling over 6,000 apartments, with a total development cost of approximately $1.4 billion. We also have one completed fully leased and operating student housing community that serves the students attending the University of Texas at Austin. Including these communities, we have a diversified development pipeline that exceeds $5 billion and over 20,000 apartments. In 2014, we sold our first two apartment communities and given the construction schedule of our pipeline. We are positioned to sell another five communities in the back half of 2015. With these sales and our management, construction and development fees, our multifamily business should generate between $15 million and $18 million of pretax earnings in fiscal year 2015. As we have discussed in the past, we have been merchant building our apartment communities with third-party institutional capital on a deal-by-deal basis. As we move into 2015, we are looking to create a multifamily fund that would allow us to both develop and hold our completed and leased apartment communities as a portfolio in order to capture the recurring income stream from the portfolio. We are cautiously optimistic that we can take our apartment programs in the next level and create longer-term shareholder value from this platform. In the fourth quarter, Rialto produced operating earnings of $38.2 million reflecting our continued progress in transitioning from an asset heavy balance sheet investor to a capital light investment manager and commercial loan originator and securitizer. Rialto has now returned over $400 million of invested capital to the parent company just since last year and we expect to generate at least another $250 million of cash from our initial direct investments for us to recycle by the end of 2016. Our investment management and servicing platforms have been growing assets under management where we have a very strong asset base from which we are harvesting value for investors and for our company. We are continuing to build upon the base established with our first two real estate fund. Fund I became fully invested in early 2013 and in less than two years, our investors already have received well over 100% of their invested capital back from income and monetizations and with the distribution of carried interest this quarter, we now have about 1.5 times our investment with a lot more to go. Fund II has already invested or committed to invest approximately $1.2 billion of equity in 75 transaction and also continues to make current distributions of income to investors that, to-date, have exceeded over 18%. We still have almost $400 million of equity to invest and expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later this year. And to complement our real estate fund, we also have almost $500 million of equity to investor led mezzanine lending. We have an outstanding investment team that is extremely well positioned to continue to build our asset management business. Additionally, Rialto mortgage finance, our high return equity lending platform is originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loan on stabilized cash flow in commercial real estate properties. During the quarter, we completed our 12 securitization transaction selling over $500 million of RMF originated loans, maintaining our strong margins and bringing our total to $2.2 billion in only our first five quarters of operation. Finally, our FivePoint communities program continues to make significant progress in developing our premium California master-planned communities. At Heritage Fields or El Toro, builders in the first phase of 726 homesites have sold 660 homes, over 90% of the homes released for sale with strong pricing power and pace through the fourth quarter. FivePoint has entered into contracts on the second phase with nine builders for 14 neighborhood with 916 homesites. Lennar will build 253 homes in four of the neighborhoods along with eight of the builders. The land sales will close in the first quarter and Lennar will recognize approximately $30 million of income from these sales in that period. Additionally, FivePoint entered into a contract to sell 73 acres of land to Broadcom Corporation for the relocation of their headquarters to the Great Park neighborhood. They plan to build a campus with two million square foot of office space. The profit from this transaction will be recognized in Lennar's second quarter. At Newhall, we anticipate to begin land development later this year as Newhall success in monetizing non-core assets has allowed the venture to maintain a significant cash position of approximately $185 million at year-end. And in San Francisco, sales continue to be very strong at the shipyard. We are now just about sold out of our first phase of 88 home that will begin closing in March. There are an additional 159 homes under construction, most of which will deliver in the fourth quarter of 2015. Also in the fourth quarter, we closed a joint venture with Macerich, a retail REIT, to develop a 500,000 square-foot regional mall on the site of the Candlestick Park Stadium. The mall, along with an additional 180,000 square feet of retail space, is expected to open in the beginning of 2018. Overall and in summary, our company has been busy and our company is extremely well positioned to thrive in the current market conditions. The shallow slope of recovery with what we believe will be an extended duration, provides an excellent environment for our management team to drive our business forward, pick up market share and produce excellent results. Over the past quarters, we have been articulating a soft pivot to a land-lighter model in homebuilding and an asset light model for our ancillary businesses. These initiatives are becoming a core strategy for our company as we develop a carefully refined asset allocation program for our now matured business lines and focus on cash generation and deleveraging our balance sheet. As we move through 2015, we expect to amplify the company focus on moderating growth, focusing on ROIC and driving cash flow as we enter the back half of 2015 and into 2016. We have an excellent management team that continues to be focused on our carefully crafted strategy. This team has positioned Lennar with advantage to assets that will continue to drive profitability in our core homebuilding and financial services business line. Additionally, we have developed a well diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses continued to mature. Today, we are proud to share our results for fiscal 2014 and we look forward to sharing our further progress as we move into a new year. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.07 per diluted share versus $0.73 per share in the prior year. I will provide some additional color to the numbers starting with homebuilding. Our gross margin on home sales was 25.6% compared with 26.8% in the prior year, however, this exceeded our fourth quarter gross margin goal discussed on our last conference call. The gross margin improved sequentially by 40 basis points, however, declined 120 basis points year-over-year due to a moderation in pricing power as labor, material and land costs increased. Sales incentives increased by 30 basis points to prior year to 6.6% as a percentage of home sale revenue. The gross margin percentage for the quarter remained highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. Additionally, we had a $5.8 million benefit to the gross margin during the quarter relating to Chinese drywall settlements. In addition to the 30 basis points improvement in our SG&A, we have also recognized operating leverage on our corporate G&A line which improved by 10 basis points to 2.2% as a percent of total revenues. The combined categories of land sale income, joint venture profit and other income, netted to $14.4 million of profit this year versus $22.1 million in the prior year. Other interest expense declined 75% year-over-year from $20.5 million in the prior year to $5.2 million in the current quarter, as we continued to open communities and increase the qualifying assets eligible for capitalization. As Stuart mentioned, we opened 75 new communities to end the year at 625 active communities. This is at the high end of the goal that we provided to 2014 and a 16% increase over 2013. We purchased 4,400 home sites during the quarter, totaling $254 million. Our total land acquisition spend for the full year in 2014 declined by 21% to $1.4 billion from $1.8 billion in 2013. This is consistent with the strategy that Stuart articulated to softly pivot from longer-term land parcels to shorter-term deals. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 165,000 homesites, of which 133,000 are owned and 32,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory at quarter-end is carefully managed averaging 1.5 homes per community at 948 homes. Turning to financial services. They had a strong quarter with operating earnings increasing to $30.2 million from $17 million in the prior year. The increased earnings was due to higher volume and higher profit per transaction in both the mortgage and title operations. The mortgage pretax income increased to $23.9 million from $14.3 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations increased 52% to $2 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The increased volume was a result of higher home closings by Lennar, a higher capture rate of Lennar homebuyers and the expansion of our retail platform. The capture rate improved to 80% this quarter from 75% in the prior year. Our title company's profit increased to $6.9 million in the quarter from $3.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher profit per transaction. Our title team continues to focus on maximizing the title opportunities within our ancillary businesses. Turning to Rialto. The composition of Rialto is $38.2 million of operating earnings by the three types of investments before G&A and Rialto interest expense are as follows. First, the investment management business contributed $66.5 million of earnings which includes $16 million of equity in earnings from the real estate funds and $50.5 million of management fees and other. The $50.5 million includes $34.7 million of a carried interest distribution from Rialto Fund I. This was the first collection of funds pertaining to the carried interest which was distributed to cover the income tax obligation which resulted from allocations of taxable income to Rialto. The carried interest for Rialto Real Estate Fund I, under a hypothetical liquidation, increased by approximately $22 million for the quarter. After the 34.7 million distribution, the carried interest is now at $110 million. Second, our new Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $510 million of commercial loans into three securitizations, resulting in earnings of $19.2 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses. Third, our direct investments, which primarily are being monetized, had a profit of $200,000 and we will continue to liquidate these direct investments as we go forward. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $40.2 million for the quarter and interest expense relating to the senior notes was $7.4 million. Rialto ended the year with a strong liquidity position with over $200 million of cash. Turning to the multifamily segment. There were no apartment building sales expected during the fourth quarter and their results reflect startup costs associated with the buildout of our construction pipeline, which positions us well for a profitable 2015. Our investment in multifamily is approximately $200 million and we continue to grow this business primarily using third-party capital. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.8% and for the year, it was 34.8%. The rate was favorably impacted by the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction which is now available to us since we have utilized our federal net operating losses in various tax credits. Turning to the balance sheet. 2014 was another year of balance sheet strengthening. Our liquidity improved as our homebuilding cash balance improved by almost $200 million with no outstanding borrowings under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility at year-end. Our leverage improved by 150 basis points as our homebuilding net debt to total cap was reduced to 44.1%. We grew stockholders' equity by $658 million to $4.8 billion and our book value per share increased to $23.54. During the quarter, we paid off $250 million of maturing 5.5% senior notes and issued $350 million of 4.5% senior notes due 2019. We continue to reduce our borrowing rate as the company's financial condition strengthens. Turning to 2015 goals. I wanted to summarize what's been said on this call and highlight a few additional goals for 2015. Starting with deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 23,500 and 24,000 homes for 2015. We expect a backlog conversion ratio of approximately 70% for the first quarter, 85% to 90% for the second and third quarters and 90% to 100% for the fourth quarter. Turing to gross margin. Consistent with the goal that we set at the beginning of 2014, our gross margin percentage for 2014 netted to approximately 25%, excluding insurance recoveries and other nonrecurring items. We expect our gross margins in 2015 to average 24% for the full year. Although of these remaining healthy margins, the reduction is a result of less pricing power anticipated in 2015, bringing on some mothballed communities with modestly lower gross margins and a slight increase in the number of entry-level communities. There will be seasonality between the quarters, with the first quarter being the lowest gross margin percentage and then improvement in the gross margin percentage as volumes increase throughout the year. Our SGA and corporate G&A lines, we continue to focus on leveraging these lines and expect 15 to 25 basis points of potential improvement in 2015. Financial services earnings are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for the year. The quarterly amounts are expected to be spread similar to last year, with the first quarter anticipated to be the lowest quarter of profitability. For Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $30 million and $40 million for the year and it's heavily weighted to the second half of the year. As a reminder, 2014 included a partial collection and recognition of carried interest from Real Estate Fund I and additionally we had significant gains and increase in mark-to-market for assets held by our real estate fund which are not expected to be as significant 2015 at this point. Multifamily is transitioning in 2015 into a profit center for the full year. We are expecting five buildings to be sold, all in the second half of the year, with the 2015 profit expected to be between $15 million and $18 million. In 2015, we expect to have building sales coming from this segment in each quarter. Joint venture and land sales, the El Toro joint venture which Stuart highlighted, will result in profit to Lennar of approximately $30 million in the first quarter and additionally $10 million in the second quarter. We are not expecting other significant transactions and therefore the third and fourth quarters for all of our JVs are expected to be about flat. We are expecting approximately $25 million of wholly owned land sale profit in 2015 with the majority forecasted for the second half of the year. Our 2015 effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 34.5% to 35% and our net community count is expected to increase approximately 8% to 675 active communities by the end of 2015. With these goals in mind, we are well positioned to deliver strong topline and bottomline growth throughout the year. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Stephen East with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Stephen East: Thank you. Good morning, guys. The question I have been getting from --
Stuart Miller: Viv, I think we lost him.
Operator: Yes. The line has disconnected. I apologize. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim: Good Morning. Thanks very much, guys. Yes, I guess, a lot of things to talk about but I did want to talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance for the year. You talked about the fact that there will be some improvements sequentially, which is pretty normal, but I am guessing probably also that the year-on-year comparison would probably, the decline would probably intensify in the back half of the year. I was wondering if you could confirm that that's probably the right way to looking at it. And also if you could talk about the -- you mentioned bringing back some mothballed communities. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? Sort of where? Why now? And what kind of margin differential do these projects usually have? Thanks.
Rick Beckwitt: Hi, Steve, it's Rick. I will answer this. On the gross margin comparison year-over-year, we sort of hinted to about 4% decline year-over-year going from 25% to about 24%. Typical with the year, you will see some normal sequential improvements throughout the year, starting low, ending up higher. And probably the peak to trough won't be as dramatic. With regard to the mothballed communities, this has been something that we have been doing all, you know, over the last couple of years, evaluating when they are right to bring back on and this is just a continuation of our asset monetization program. They are really spread across the country. Not anything really dominated in one particular area. We would look at 2015 probably in an order of magnitude about 10% of our deliveries will come from things that were taken out of that mothballed bucket and the margin differential is 200 basis points, 300 basis points, plus or minus, between what the average margin is for the company and those communities.
Jon Jaffe: Hi, Steve, it's Jon. So just to clarify that the 10% out of mothballed communities is communities opened in 2014 and what will open in 2015. So that represent that whole universe. And relative to timing of the margin in your question, as you know, our first quarter is always our lightest quarter for deliveries. So we have field expense impacting the margins there. So it's really not back-end loaded in terms of decline. I think you will see pretty consistent throughout the year, the differential that Bruce spoke about.
Stephen Kim: Okay, that's great. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of incentive behavior from your competitors in the marketplace and maybe I assume that that may vary from region-to-region? I know people are going to be particularly interested in what you are seeing in terms of posturing in Houston as well as in California. So maybe you could just talk generally about qualitatively what you are seeing in terms of incentive behavior in the field and also with a little bit a geographic flavor? Thanks.
Stuart Miller: Okay. So let me take that, Steve and just say that pretty much across the board, we are seeing intensified competition as builders do go out and chase volume. It's been somewhat of a complex market where a lot of factors are impacting sales across the board. You mentioned, of course, Houston, where there are more questions than answers right now from the field. Houston, of course, is at least in part, as an economy dependent on the oil complex and the oil complex is going through a reconciliation. We haven't seen a significant change in that market condition. We are seeing a little bit at the higher end of a pullback but we have anticipated in our internal projections that there will be further reconciliation in that marketplace. It's in part one of the reasons for some of the pullback in our anticipated margins. Houston is an important market to us. California, we have seen less impact so far. We continue to see pretty strong buying patterns in California. I know that there are questions about the currency changes and what that will mean for some of the foreign buyers there, but we haven't seen much of a pullback there. I know that there been other reports. So you know, across the landscape there a lot of factors that are moving markets and changing the landscape and it certainly has intensified the competitive landscape for all builders.
Stephen Kim: Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: We do have Mr. East back on the line. One moment. Stephen East, your line is open.
Stephen East: Thank you. And I don't know, I got cut off. So I just heard Steve's question. But if I could just follow-up a little bit, you know, the gross margins. If you could sort of rank order, going from 25% to 24% this year, as the things that you talked about, the mothball, the entry-level, et cetera. If you have already answer that, I apologize. And I was also wanting to understand how important is this mix shift become for you as you go through 2015 and then to 2016 as far as focusing on the entry level?
Rick Beckwitt: Hi, Steve, it's Rick. We have articulated for quite a while now that as that entry-level market comes back, we are going to be an increasing participant in that market and we plan accordingly. Most of that activity is really geared towards Texas and parts of Florida for the most part, although our other markets are participants in that activity. With regard to the margin on that, the margin for us on our entry level product is lower margin, but that doesn't mean that from a pretax and operating basis, that the margins are significantly different. It's just a different business model. With regard to the legacy assets, the mothballed assets, about 10% of our deliveries for 2015 will come from those communities. They carry lower margins, but on blend, we are pretty positive about our 24% margin for the year. It's a good, healthy margin and it could produce good bottomline profits for the company.
Stephen East: Okay, thanks and then just a follow-up question on the West. Big order gains. I guess could you give us some clarity on what was really driving that? And I heard some of the commentary about the Asian buyer, et cetera, but a significant difference in the West on your performance versus earlier and just maybe any color you can give and how you think about the sustainability of that?
Jon Jaffe: Yes, Steve, it's Jon Jaffe. We saw a healthy sales pace in the fourth quarter, above the company average. Inland Empire, which you know, there are some questions about -- we saw a pace of about four sales per community per month. I think we have some very well located communities due to our land position that we acquired earlier. We have got some very strongly performing master-planned communities. In the Bay Area, we are very well-positioned. We saw good activity through the Central Valley. So we really didn't see much movement in incentives to drive that sales pace a little bit, but I think because of the product and the locations of our communities, performance is remaining strong.
Stuart Miller: Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The first question I just had, if possible, I think there was a reference to some of the expected cadence of the gross margin throughout 2015, maybe starting a little bit lower and then increasing throughout the year as typically occurs but maybe not to a wide variance of range. Coming off of the 4Q results, I was just wondering if it is possible to give a little bit better granularity in terms of, you know you are coming off of a 25.6% and I guess, excluding the gain from Chinese drywall it's closer to 25.3%, would you be looking at something around the 24% range that you are looking for the full year? Or would it be, I guess, a little bit below that? And then I just have a follow-up.
Bruce Gross: For the guidance, Mike, this is Bruce, was around 24% as the average for the whole year. The first quarter tends to be lower because we have less volume and we have more field costs, which runs through gross margins. So that brings the number down. So it affects the first quarter to be below the 24% average for the year and then for the rest of the year the number should be closer to the average and maybe a little bit higher at the end of the year.
Michael Rehaut: Okay and I guess just the second question. You had mentioned that you had incorporated some caution or change in the Houston market into your full-year guidance. I was wondering if you could be a little more granular there as well? Do you expect some -- maybe how much of margin contraction do you expect in Houston? And maybe you can give us a sense of Houston in terms of the revenue impact and if it's operating right now at above or below average corporate margins?
Bruce Gross: Mike, I think it's always been our objective to call them like we see them, to be straight and to give the best estimate of what we are seeing out ahead of ourselves. And so as it relates to Houston, it's not an exact science. The market has not yet quite revealed itself. But there are other crosscurrents that are defining lot of questions that exists in the marketplace. And of course, we have injected appropriate conservatism in our thinking. So to get down and to get too granular, I think that we are making educated guesses in each of our markets about where the market is potentially trending. We can think across a broad landscape. We think about the California markets and some of the foreign purchasing that has come in those markets as potentially something that has to be considered and factored into our equation. Likewise in South Florida, we have a pretty robust foreign investment group and those markets all have more questions than answers right now and the estimates are somewhat imperfect. What we have done with each of our divisions as we have gone through and had done at a very local level, think about the impacts of not just the day-to-day traffic coming in, but the potential impacts of macroeconomic factors that, as I noted in my opening, are choppy and sometimes confusing in evaluating the market. So I am not sure that we can get particularly granular. It really is a market-by-market and community-by-community assessment that is kind of rolled up. But what we have tried to do is inject appropriate conservatism in thinking about 2015 and the competitive pressures that exists in the marketplace as we put together our planning for the year ahead.
Michael Rehaut: And just, if I could squeeze in one last one on the incentives and then I will get back in queue. It seems like it is broad-based. I just was curious in terms of the increase in incentives. If that was broad-based or more concentrated in certain markets and maybe how much of the monthly 100 bips of margin decline, gross margin declined for the company is incentives, being a cause of that 100 bips?
Bruce Gross: Incentives is always an interesting question. It really is just a part of purchase price. And as we have noted, it's part of a community-by-community evaluation, very micro level. Incentives in some markets are running a lot higher. In other markets, they are very low. Even within markets, there are some communities that have much higher incentives associated with them or purchase price alterations associated with them. We are very focused on looking at a community level, figuring out where the sales pace has slowed to a point where we are no longer properly leveraging overheads, think about where we add incentives to bring that sales pace up so that we maximize profitability out of the community. So is it concentrated in an area? No. It's a broad-based assessment that you really can't put your finger on and delineate for the market. But it rolls up to what you are seeing here.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thank you.
Bruce Gross: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Eli Hackel: Thanks. Good morning. Stuart, you seem excited or at least positively inclined about some of the mortgage market changes that have been announced. I was just wondering your level of confidence that these changes will actually impact the market. Some of the previously announced changes really don't seem to have done much. So just curios to hear your thoughts around that.
Stuart Miller: Well, some of them have been articulated and not quite implemented. I wouldn't overemphasize my enthusiasm for the specific changes. I think it's the beginning of a process. And I think that the fact that we are hearing this articulation at this point is suggestive of the fact that people are starting to understand that perhaps we have overcorrected and perhaps it's detrimental to the overall economy and to the landscape of the population and that we have got to start getting and reverting to normal. I think the reversion to normal will unlock a lot of pent-up demand. It's going to take some time and it's why I say on the horizon, I see the best times for the homebuilding operation. But do I see a correction that takes place that alters the landscape in the next quarter, I think no. It's more part of the process. But I am fairly optimistic that politically, as a country, we are going to get to understand that capital is going to define or access to capital is going to define what builds the middle class and some of that revolves around housing and I think that people are going to be recommitted to building a for-sale housing market. That's going to work very well for us and other builders.
Eli Hackel: Thanks and then I was just wondering, you talked a little bit about it, but maybe go into a little bit more detail about the ongoing cost of the soft pivot capital allocation. Do you expect to be cash flow positive this year? And if so, sort of what are you thinking about doing with that cash?
Stuart Miller: We have been talking about this for about the last year-and-a-half and it's been very much part of management's focus. We have been gently pivoting away from a land-heavy strategy towards a land-lighter strategy and it is with the focus of becoming cash flow positive. We do think as we get the end of this year, we do start to turn to cash flow positive with a healthier turn, even more in 2016. We are very focused on our return on invested capital. We think that the first move with our additional cash flow will be in the form of debt reduction and focusing on our balance sheet, but ultimately we will be considering where access cash flow comes from. Remember that it's not just the homebuilding business that should be cash flow generative, ultimately our ancillary businesses also start to contribute and we think we are going to have some important decisions to make as we get into future years.
Eli Hackel: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman. Your line is open.
Alan Ratner: Hi, good morning. First, just a housekeeping question. The Hunters Point delivery, is that going to flow through the JV or consolidated blend?
Stuart Miller: The Hunters Point deliveries will flow through the joint venture line.
Alan Ratner: Okay. So when you gave the guidance for breakeven, I think, in the back-half of the year, on JVs, I thought you mentioned, first of the deliveries coming through there. So that's kind of incorporated in that guidance?
Stuart Miller: It is and we are doing very well with sales at Hunters Point. But just remember, we had a lot of front-end development costs that are also running through that line in addition to the closings of the first deliveries at Hunters Point, so will see more contribution as we get into 2016.
Alan Ratner: Got it. Thanks and just on the slow pivot ROIC focus. How should we think about longer-term how Lennar looks under that type of model because investors clearly have gotten used to you guys certainly outperforming on the gross margin line and probably the volume growth line as well as you benefited from that long land pipeline you had? So should we ultimately expect margins to revert more to that lower 20% range, which I think is indicative of a asset light shorter land model or should we stop short of going all the way there because you are going to settle out somewhere in between? And I guess, just kind of the cadence to get there, are we talking about this multiyear process or is this something that by 2016, 2017, you are pretty much where you ultimately envision the company being?
Stuart Miller: Look, I think that we still have an advantage in land in that would have land positions that carry-forward. That's enabled us to kind of fish in a different pond and use our land expertise to continue to build price advantaged land positions that's held us in good stead. We think, as historically, we will continue to outperform relative to gross margin there. Gross margins were down to moderate at some point and it shouldn't catch anyone off-guard that they will and should be some moderation in gross margin as we become more of a retail purchaser of land. But I think a normalized operating program of buying land and becoming more of a manufacturing model as markets mature as there is less distressed opportunity out there is exactly what Lennar is focused on, making sure that we are carefully balancing buying good land positions in the right locations, operating an excellent manufacturing model on the homebuilding side and really focusing on our balance sheet in the generation of cash and return on invested capital.
Jon Jaffe: I might add one thing on this. Part of the pivot is managing the length of the deal and how long we are in individual communities. And as we have bought various communities over the past, in the downturn some of these communities were very sizable that had multi-multi-year runs in order for us to build through them. So as we are managing the cycle and this pivot, it's a changing focus on the length of how long we want to be in some of these communities, given the fact that the market might change and we want to have a shorter-term of exposure.
Stuart Miller: Next question.
Operator: We have a question from Megan McGath with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Megan McGath: Good morning. Thanks. This is a little bit of a follow-up to that last question and the last commentary there, I think is partially an answer. But I guess looking at Texas now, but this could be really any market where you are starting to perhaps see signs of slowdown or you see some writing on the wall. Can you talk a little bit about levers at your disposal? And maybe lessons learned versus the last downturn? Are there things that you would likely do quicker? Let's say, you start to see things slowdown, perhaps try to pickup pace quicker? Or related to last comment, is your inventory different than it was, let's say, nine or ten years ago that would just perhaps limit the over building that we could potentially see in some of these markets as you see sort of a fast slowdown in employment?
Stuart Miller: Look, as I noted in my opening comments, I think that the downside, even in a market like Houston, the downside is kind of defined by a change in the employment structure of the market where you start to see the oil complex really shed some jobs and that affects confidence and home sales, but I think that there are some countercurrent kind of considerations. While the oil complex moves down, gas prices come down and Houston is a more diversified platform than it has been in prior oil downturns. So we are not looking, we are not expecting a very sizable downturn, but I think that the way that we have configured our company and we have focused on purchasing assets, the locations that we have focused on as we have gone through, even in a downturn scenario, are the locations that hold up the best, that continue to perform the best in the market and we think that any downturn ends up being fairly shallow and we move forward. So from a lessons learned perspective, we have clearly not gone out to the B-, C locations. We have not gotten out over our skis, We have already been tapering back on the land supply, the tail of land supply. And I think that we are really well-positioned to be able to just kind of, in an orderly fashion, work through inventories even in a fairly aggressive downturn scenario and be positioned with strong cash.
Rick Beckwitt: And I guess, just one comment on the Texas market since it's been brought up a number of time. The overall economy in Texas is very strong. You know, if you look at as, just going back to Stuart's opening remarks, job growth across the state has been incredibly strong, inventories are in the neighborhood of maybe one to two months of finished home supply. On the new side, resale inventory is extremely well as well and you have just outside of Houston, just very strong economies, with excellent job growth. Houston, in particular, as Stuart said, we haven't really been too much of change in Houston yet. But we were smart enough to know that if oil prices continue to be depressed, that there will be some negative reaction in the market. It generally happens that it is price point focused and one of the things that we have been focused on is making sure that we are a participant in all of the price points in Houston market in order to insulate ourselves to as much as possible with the changes in the market demands. And we are well-positioned that we are smart enough to know that as oil moves down, there maybe some job loss, primarily more on higher end and it could impact pricing and that's why we have given guidance to a little bit lower margin in Houston.
Megan McGath: Great. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up around the commentary on some of the government initiatives, clearly too early to have seen anything on the FHA but it's been a month or so since the announcements around the FHFA, 3% down mortgages and any kind of early indications that that's taking hold?
Stuart Miller: Not really. And I think that you have got to look at the landscape as relative to many of the articulations as multidimensional. One lever is probably not going to move the needle. I think that we have to properly regard the fact that the regulatory landscape has really discouraged mortgage lending. There is more than just underwriting criteria and downpayments at stake here. We have got to get people back in the game of making mortgages to people that really need the money as opposed to making mortgages to the people who are so far qualified that we never have to, but the only mortgage that we are to make is to Warren Buffett, we are certainly not going to have any defaults, but we are not going to make a lot of mortgages. We would better be able to bring the risk profile back to a normalized setting. And it is in large part, the regulatory environment that is defining some of that. I think that the discourse, the commentary that's been coming out of HUD and FHFA is positive and constructive. People recognizing that perhaps we have put too strong of a lid on this mortgage business and if you listen to the commentary coming out of the banks, there still isn't a lot of appetite for land. So we haven't seen a lot of movement yet in the fields from these articulation, but they are promising in terms of important people starting to understand how the landscape has to migrate in order to really bring the buyer back to the market.
Megan McGath: Great. That's helpful. Thanks.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Dahl with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Michael Dahl: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess the comments on and the discussion around ROIC, it sounds like the implication would be that land spend would be down again in 2015? And if that is the case, then community count growth probably moderates further in 2016. Is that a fair way to think about how you are viewing the landscape today?
Stuart Miller: Well, land spend will move around a little bit as we go through the next couple of years. It's a little bit hard to peg down. What I am articulating is a focus of the management team to shorten the tail on some of the lands that we are purchasing and really looking at the risk profile as we go forward. That doesn't necessarily need a curtailment of community count expansion. It might be a moderation of the rate of growth that you see in community count. I think we have articulated about an 8% growth year-over-year as we look ahead. But I think you kind of look at that kind of pace as we go forward as well. But it's more of the tail, the duration of land that we are purchasing rather than the number of communities. So we expect to continue to grow at a healthy pace as we go forward. And over time, where did I think of things for this management team is when we focus we succeed. The articulation internally for our group is , hey, let's bring the tail down, let's bring the risk profile down, let's continue to grow our business, but let's not get out over our skis as the market matures, as land pricing matures and let's continue to grow the business as the market permits.
Michael Dahl: Great and then as a follow-up, I guess you know, you have clearly articulated a number of different things happening across specific markets. As you think about those relative to your investments, where you looking to grow the most as you look out to the deals that you are instructing your field reps to go after this year?
Stuart Miller: Okay. So, a piece of your question cut out on us, but I think your question is where are we looking to grow the most? And the answer to that question is, almost a quarter-by-quarter evaluation on a market-by-market basis. And it's what we probably do the best. It's all about allocating capital to where that capital is performing the best, based on the reading that we are getting from the field from the traffic that's coming in. The market that is healing and that is moving forward well is going to get more capital allocated to it. The market where we see patterns of pullbacks, patterns of change in the markets in the negative, we are going to be investing less capital. So right now we are kind of, if you think about the things that we have already talked about, we are kind of in a wait-and-see mode relative to Houston. We want to see a little bit more evidence of well, how the market is going to present itself and so we are probably investing less capital there. We have excellent positioned to build on in the meantime. There are other markets like the Bay Area that we continue to have a strong view about and we are probably investing more capital there. But it is a regular assessment that we put in place through our top management team communicating with the divisions based on the patterns that we are seeing in the field.
Michael Dahl: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have a question from Michael Roxland with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Peter Gallo: Hi, guys. It's actually Peter Gallo on for Mike. Good morning or afternoon at this point. Just a couple of housekeeping questions for Rialto on the advance accrued interest. Is that a one time thing for this quarter? Or is that something we should think about as a recurring cash flow going forward? What's the best way to look at that?
Bruce Gross: So, for this quarter, it represented the last two-and-a-half years worth of taxable income calculation. So it will be recurring but at a significantly lower amount as you look at next year. It's going to continue through next year as well.
Peter Gallo: Okay and then just second, I know in your comments, Stuart, I think you called out some statistics on Next Gen in terms of order growth. Do you have anything similar, any sort of commentary around your Everything's Included?
Stuart Miller: Everything's Included has continued to be a Lennar marketing avenue that is a differentiator. Well, we haven't gotten an Everything's Included question in a long time. But we still think that sets us apart from the market in a positive and constructive way. I always think that plagiarism is the best form of flattery and when we see other builders jumping on that kind of program, which is what we have started to see. We know that it's something that attracts a lot of attention and sets us apart in a very positive way. Our Everything's Included program is something that we focus on a lot. We think that we can be a lot more efficient and effective in harvesting cost reductions as we deliver greater quality and a broader product offering. There certainly is segment of the market that wants to customize. We are not the builder for that segment of the market, but we do offer an extraordinary value with our Everything's Included program and that value is what has driven our sales as well it has. Even with that said, our Everything's Included program as we have grown it over time, does enable some personalization, so we broaden our offering to a solid range of the market and certainly enables us to capture more than our share of the business.
Peter Gallo: Great. Thanks.
Stuart Miller: Okay and let's make the next the last question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Jade Rahmani with KBW. Your line is open.
Jade Rahmani: Hi. Thanks for taking the question.
Stuart Miller: Sure.
Jade Rahmani: Just wanted to ask on Rialto. If you could comment on your view of the risk retention rules and whether you see this is a benefit to Rialto, given the five-year holding period and the 5% risk retention requirement?
Stuart Miller: So happy that we have on there. Jeff can really chime in. Go ahead, Jeff.
Jeff Krasnoff: Yes. Actually, from our perspective, we look at it as a big positive. In terms of the competitive setup there, it's going to be difficult for a lot of folks to do that, given some of the hedge funds that have come in, because of the five-year retention. So we think that that's, number one, is very good. And then number two is the 5% rule. We have a multi-disciplinary sort of fund raising capability with our investors that look for returns that go form one end of the spectrum to the other. So I think that we are going to see pretty uniquely qualified to be a buyer there. And we also expect that before the rules go into effect, which is now a little bit less than two years that there will be a rush to securitize that we think we can increase supply. So I think we are, as far as all three of those points, we are well-positioned for it. I think that the risk retention rules really speak directly to our core competencies. It kind of ushers things directly into the arena that we have historically operated and operated best. So the answer is yes, we think that it's a best for Rialto.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks and then just secondly regarding the cash flow that you expect to get back from Rialto? How do you see redeploying that capital? Would it be redeployed into Rialto? Or into Lennar's other businesses?
Stuart Miller: Look, Rialto has really taken on a mature positioned within the company. Rialto is the ultimate asset light model today. We have not been investing primary capital in deals in any significant way through Rialto. We have invested and will continue to invest in the funds that we create and participate as a limited partner in those fund even as we act as the general partner as well. But those private capital funds are the primary source of investment for Rialto and really mark the future for the company. So the Rialto strategy has more in the direction that we wanted it to over the past years and Rialto is positioned to carry forward with very limited need for capital. So we expect that that capital will be returned to the parent company and will be part of the cash flow that we have talked about earlier.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks for taking the questions.
Stuart Miller: You bet. So thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to moving forward and reporting on our progress through 2015. Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Thank you. I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our third quarter update. This morning, I’m joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, our President, Rick Beckwitt, is here and Jeff Krasnoff, our Chief Executive Officer of Rialto; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is on the phone from California and they’ll join in on the Q&A. As is customary on our conference calls, I want to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and our operations in particular. Then Bruce is going to give greater detail. We will then open up for question and answer, and we’d like to request that during our Q&A, each person please limit themselves to one question and one follow up. So let me go ahead and begin and let me begin by saying that we’re very pleased to report another very solid quarter of performance for our company with profitability in each of our major segments. Our third quarter results demonstrate that our company is positioned to be able to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions due to a carefully crafted and balanced operating strategy. Generally speaking, the market has continued a slow and steady recovery that is markedly different from past down cycle recoveries. History would suggest a more vertical recovery especially given the severity of the economic decline. This recovery has been a decidedly different experience as the slope of recovery has been shallow and the expected acceleration has not materialized. While this is generally the case for the overall economy, it is very much the case for housing in particular. The housing recovery has been moving gently upward in a fairly narrow channel with movement up and down along the way. That channel has been downside supported by the significant production deficit that has resulted from the extremely low volumes of dwelling both single family and multifamily that have been built over the past seven years. Before this downturn, anything below 1 million housing starts in a year was considered almost a housing depression. This recovery is just now getting us back to that level of starts. We’re still adding to a deficit in production given the housing needs of the country and that in our opinion limits the downside for the recovery going forward. At the same time, the recovery has been and likely will continue to be upside constrained by a limited supply of available homes, new and existing, on the market, limited supply of land available to add to the supply of homes and constrained demand from purchasers who would like to buy but are unable to access the mortgage market. While many investors have been disappointed that 2014 sales to date did not develop the steep vertical acceleration that they had anticipated, the market did continue to move slowly and steadily forward driving volume upwards and still driving price upward though at a somewhat slower pace. I would suggest that this is a very healthy and comfortable environment for the well-capitalized national builders and for Lennar in particular. The shallow slope of recovery is likely to provide a steady backdrop for market share expansion in a fragmented industry and an extended recovery duration for those who are able to participate by leveraging a strong capital base. We continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of improvement in the housing market remain a steadily improving economy with a slowly improving employment picture, unlocking pent-up demand while supplies remain constrained to meet that demand. We continue to believe that there remains a production deficit and that this shortfall will continue to define the housing market for the foreseeable future and will drive the housing recovery forward. A slow and steady housing recovery will also continue to benefit the rental market as first-time home purchasers find limited access to the for sale market barred by higher down payments, very strict underwriting standards, invasive approval processes and increasing fee structures from the government and banks. This will likely continue to put upward pressure on rental rates and drive valuation for rental properties upward as well. Lennar has navigated the first three quarters of 2014 with very solid results as each of our businesses showed strong performance and are well positioned for continued future performance. A combination of solid management execution of our articulated strategies and strategic investments in core assets combine to produce strong results and will enable continued industry-leading performance throughout the year. Homebuilding, of course, remains the primary driver of our quarterly performance. Lennar’s strategy was to carefully balance pricing power, sales incentives, brokerage commissions and advertising spend to maximize our results. The execution of this strategy produced 23% sales growth, 25.2% gross margins and a 14.8% operating margin. Homebuilding revenues grew to $1.8 billion, up 25% over last year while deliveries were 5,457 homes, up 9% over the prior year. Our sales pace in the third quarter were 3.3 sales per community per month and this was basically flat with 2013 second quarter pace of 3.2. Our average sales price increased by 14% year-over-year to $332,000. During the quarter, we opened 73 new communities and closed out 49 communities to end at 603 active communities, a 17% year-over-year increase. Q3’s SG&A was 10.4%, a 20 basis point year-over-year increase. We did not benefit from much operating leverage this quarter as the cost of opening new communities, cost associated with developing our new Internet site and digital platform for marketing and some additional advertising and brokerage fees associated with the competitive landscape added to SG&A. Nevertheless, we continue to expect to benefit significantly from SG&A leverage as we grow volume in the future. With many of our competitors offering large incentives to drive sales, we controlled our incentives at a 5.8% rate for the quarter, which was down year-over-year and sequentially from 6% and 5.9%, respectively. In place of increasing incentives across the board, we strategically used them on specific communities where we thought the sales pace was a little slow and we selectively marketed more aggressively to both the brokerage community and to consumers on communities as needed. The net result was an absorption pace that was flat with last year, combined cost of SG&A and incentives that were also flat with last year and a 30 basis point improvement in our gross margin. Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 8.5% to around $49 per square foot. This represents a mild slowing of the pace of cost increases as last quarter, cost were up more than 9% over the year. These increases are both labor and material increases and the break down between labor and material is about 40% labor and 60% material, which has not changed materially in the past few years. Our sales continue to benefit from the execution of our next-gen product strategy. Year-over-year, sales of our multigenerational brand grew by 24% totaling 275 sales in the third quarter. We now offer next-gen plans in 208 communities across the country and in the third quarter, the average sales price for next-gen was about 34% above the company’s average. We continue to focus our homebuilding strategy on the move-up segment of the market as the first-time home purchaser has not yet been able to access the mortgage market. With that said, we currently sell approximately 30% of our homes to first-time purchasers and we remain strategically positioned with both land and product to capture the first-time homebuyer demand when it is enabled by the mortgage market and it emerges with the inevitable strong and pent-up demand that we expect. Complementing our homebuilding operations, of course our financial services segment continued to build its primary business alongside the homebuilder. Bruce will talk a little bit more about our financial services progress, which had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of 27.1 million compared to 23.5 million last year. While our homebuilding and financial services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer term value creation platforms alongside. Let me start here by saying a hearty welcome and congratulations to our multifamily group. This quarter marks the first sales of multifamily communities to third parties and the first profit contribution to the company from this segment. We couldn’t be more pleased with these results and the excellent management team that drives this business. During the third quarter, we sold two apartment communities totaling 580 apartments and generated a $14.7 billion profit from those communities, which translated into an $8.5 million profit for the segment after overheads. Each of these sales exceeded our targeted 25% return on invested capital and 2x cash multiple. These sales demonstrate the earnings potential of a maturing business as we develop our geographically diversified $5 billion pipeline. During the third quarter, we started development and construction on four new communities. We now have 19 communities in production of which one is completed and operating, two are partially completed and starting a lease-up program and the remaining 16 are under construction. These 19 communities have approximately 4,800 apartments with an estimated development costs of approximately $1.15 billion. As we have discussed in the past, we’re building these apartments with third party institutional capital and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt. Given the construction schedule of these units and the rest of our pipeline, our multifamily segment will become a more predictable source of quarterly earnings starting in late 2015 and into 2016. In the third quarter, Rialto produced operating results of $12.4 million reflecting continued progress and transitioning from an asset-heavy balance sheet investor to a capital-light investment manager and commercial loan originator and securitizer. Rialto has now returned $385 million of invested capital to the parent company since late last year and we expect to generate at least another $250 million of cash in Rialto from initial investments for us to recycle by the end of 2016. Our investment management and servicing platform is growing assets under management and had the strong asset base from which to harvest value for investors and for our company. We’re continuing to build upon the base established with our first two real estate funds. Fund I was fully invested in early 2013 and only 18 months later has returned some 80% of invested capital from income and monetization. Fund II has already invested or committed to invest approximately $1 billion of equity in almost 70 transactions and also continues to make distributions of income to investors. We still have over $600 million of equity to invest and expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later this year. Additionally, Rialto mortgage finance, our high return equity lending platform is originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash flow in commercial real estate properties. During the quarter, we completed our ninth securitization transaction selling almost $300 million of RMF originated loans, maintaining our strong margins and bringing the total to almost $1.7 billion in only our first four quarters of operations. Our FivePoint Communities program continues to make significant progress in developing our premium California master-planned communities. At El Toro, the first phase of 726 homes is over 80% sold out and the second phase of 1,000 homes will be sold to builders in the beginning of next year with a grand opening expected in the late spring. In San Francisco, we’ve opened the shipyard where we’re pre-selling homes this quarter and are just now grand opening models. Currently, about 250 homes are under construction with another 100 scheduled to start and the venture will begin delivering these homes in 2015. So, overall and in summary, our company is extremely well positioned to thrive in the current market conditions. The shallow slope of recovery with what we believe will be an extended duration provides an excellent backdrop for our management team to drive our business forward, pick up market share and product excellent results. We have an excellent management team that is focused on a carefully crafted strategy that has positioned us with advantage assets that will continue to drive profitability in our core homebuilding and financial service business lines. Additionally, we have a well diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses continue to mature. Today, we’re very proud to share with you our results for the first three quarters of this year and we look forward to sharing our further progress at year end. With that, let me turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $0.78 per diluted share versus $0.54 per share in the prior year. I’m going to review some of the financial highlights starting with homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 25% in the third quarter and that was driven by a 10% increase in deliveries that includes unconsolidated entities and a 14% year-over-year increase in average sales price to 332,000. Our gross margin on home sales was 25.2%, which was up 30 basis points. Our excellent land position continues to be an important driver of our strong gross margins, and as Stuart mentioned, sales incentives improved by 20 basis points year-over-year. The gross margin percentage for the quarter remained highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions while all other regions also improved their gross margin percentage year-over-year. In addition to improving our gross margins, we continued to carefully manage our inventory as we reduced our completed unsold inventory sequentially from the second quarter from 905 homes to 862 homes. In addition to the operating margin leverage that we received in the quarter, and Stuart went through the SG&A discussion, we have also recognized operating leverage on our corporate G&A line. That improved 20 basis points to 2.1% as a percent of total revenues. Our interest expense continues to decline. It came down from 22.2 million in the third quarter of last year to 8.4 million in the current quarter, as we continued to open communities and increase the qualifying assets that are eligible for capitalization. This quarter we opened 73 communities and ended the quarter with 603 active communities. We purchased approximately 5,400 home sites during the quarter totaling 273 million and now our home sites owned and controlled totaled 166,000, of which 136,000 are owned and 30,000 are controlled. Our financial services business segment increased operating earnings to 27.1 million from 23.5 million in the prior year. The increased earnings occurred despite a continued challenging mortgage market with decreasing refinanced transactions. Our mortgage pre-tax income increased to 20.6 million from 18.8 million in the prior year, although refinance originations continued to decline and now represent only 9% of total originations, we were successful in replacing this lost volume with increased purchase originations. As a result, our mortgage originations increased 1.7 billion from 1.4 billion in the prior year. Our in-house mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 77% this quarter and our title company’s profit increased to 7.1 million in the quarter from 5.2 million of profit in the prior year. This was primarily due to higher profit per transaction and our title team’s focus on maximizing the title capture rate with our ancillary business transactions. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling 12.4 million compared to 1.5 million in the prior year, both are net of non-controlling interest and the composition of that 12.4 million in the three types of investments before G&A are as follows. First, the investment management business contributed 35.3 million of earnings which includes 20 million of equity and earnings from the real estate funds and 15.3 million of management fees and other. These numbers don’t include the carried interest which under hypothetical liquidation increased by approximately 19 million for the quarter and is now at 123 million for real estate Fund I. Again, that profit is not booked until we receive cash flow and their certainty with those numbers. Second, our new Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed 292 million of commercial loans into one securitization resulting in earnings of 13.1 million for the quarter before their G&A expenses. Third, our liquidating direct investments which are the remaining assets in the FDIC and bank portfolios had a net loss of 3 million which was primarily due to our share of impairments in the FDIC portfolios as we continue to focus on accelerating the monetization of certain assets in these portfolios and those numbers are partially offset by gains on sales of real estate and interest income. Rialto G&A and other expenses were 25.6 million for the quarter and interest expense was 7.5 million. The interest again primarily relates to the 350 million of senior notes and the Rialto subsidiary. Rialto had a strong liquidity position with over 200 million of cash at quarter end. Stuart went through the numbers on multifamily. Again, we had 8.5 million net profit in that segment which was 14.7 million for the first two apartment community sales and then the G&A net of management fees was approximately 6.5 million. Our investment in the multifamily segment is approximately 160 million as we continue to grow this business primarily using third party capital. The tax rate for the quarter came down. It was 33.3%. This quarter we were successful as we were favorably impacted by the settlement of the state tax exam and additional energy tax credits. We expect the tax rate for the fourth quarter to be around 36% as we start to receive the full benefit of the domestic activities reduction deduction, which is Section 199 now that we have fully utilized our federal net operating loss carryforwards. Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet liquidity is strong as we ended the third quarter with 542 million of homebuilding cash and 70 million was outstanding under our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Homebuilding net debt to total cap was 47.5%. Stockholders’ equity grew to 4.6 billion this quarter. That’s a 23% increase over the prior year and our book value per share increased to $22.32 per share. We received a credit rating upgrade during the quarter as SMP operated Lennar’s corporate rating to BB and subsequent to quarter end, we retired 250 million of our 2014 senior notes which matured on September 1. Finally, let me summarize the updated goals for 2014. Starting with deliveries, we are confirming our previously stated goals to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 homes for 2014 with a backlog conversion ratio for Q4 of 95% to 100%. This puts deliveries around the middle of the range, which ties in with the way we see the market today. Gross margin consistent with what we have previously said and given the competitive pressures in the market, we expect our gross margins to be around 25% for the fourth quarter. Rialto, we still expect a range of profits between 30 million and 40 million pre-tax for the year and looking at SG&A and corporate G&A, we continue to focus on leveraging our G&A lines and still expect at least a combined 25 basis points of improvement for all of 2014. We still expect financial services profits to be in the 65 million to 75 million range for the year and with multifamily, since we closed on the two potential apartment communities available to sell in 2014 in our third quarter, as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we’re not expecting any additional apartment community sales. Therefore, the multifamily segment will have start-up overhead expenses similar to what you saw in the second quarter of this year. We’re not expecting any significant sales activities in the joint venture and land line for the fourth quarter. That should be close to breakeven. And as I mentioned, our fourth quarter effective tax rate should be around 36%. We’re still expected to end 2014 with a range of approximately 600 to 625 communities. With that, let’s turn it back to the operator and open it up for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today is from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Hi. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.
Stuart Miller: Thanks.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: The first question I had was on trends during the quarter. Stuart, you referred to in your commentary that some competitors are offering large incentives and Bruce most recently said that given some of the competitive pressures, you expect gross margins to remain around 25% for 4Q. But in that last comment, Bruce, you think that if competitive pressures are really materially increasing, gross margins could come under a little bit of pressure in 4Q versus 3Q but that doesn’t appear to be the case. And so I was hoping, Stuart, and if Rick or Jon wanted to join in, but just elaborate on that view of incentives during the quarter if incentives really have increased to a material degree and if that’s the case gross margins going into 4Q?
Stuart Miller: Thanks, Mike. Let me let deferred to Rick and Jon. They’re very close to the action on the field.
Rick Beckwitt: Hi, Michael. It’s Rick. Bruce did highlight that we think we’ll be around 25% for the quarter. I think we’re always very straight up as to what guidance we give you with regard to margins. We have seen various competitors do different things out there with regard to incentives. As we’ve said all year long, we’re balancing pace and price to maximize the value of the assets that we’ve got. Based on the visibility of that we’ve got today, we’re not anticipating anything going outside of that range. Our incentives this last quarter did go down and we’re balancing that in every community we’ve got across the nation.
Jon Jaffe: Michael, it’s Jon. I would add to that that it clearly is a community by community focus and one of things that gives us comfort that we have the visibility in the fourth quarter is our Everything’s Included program which gives us a different value proposition for the consumer so that we can compete against incentive programs that other builders may have and continue to our pace and pricing strategy.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess second question on the order trend in sales up 23% and even the average community count approach, sales pace up roughly 4% year-over-year for the quarter. I was hoping – and that came a little bit above our expectations and I think the Street as well. I was hoping if possible if you can give us a sense month to month? I know month to month can sometimes be volatile, but if any trends if you’re going through more granularly, would that – the order growth, the 23%, was that similar throughout the quarter as well as the sales pace anything to note from the intra-quarter perspective?
Bruce Gross: Not a lot of significant differences in monthly sequentially. It follows the normal season pattern for the summer. July was probably the strongest month, but June and August were very healthy both on pace and price.
Stuart Miller: I’d just say, Michael, I think that what we’ve been seeing is that the market is tending to move a little bit around; a little bit up, a little bit down. You get that sense on a weekly basis and on a monthly basis. But the trend line is decidedly upward and as I’ve said – I probably said it three times in my remarks, it’s a gentle upward slope and you’ve got upward and downward movement around that kind of direction. And I think that’s what we’re seeing basically in our sales as we go through the months and through the weeks.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Eli Hackel from Goldman Sachs.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning. Just starting off, just wanted to touch on the pivot you’re doing in terms of your land strategy and I guess the overall question is, as you go into the cycle and as we bought a lot of land early and your ancillary businesses should be increasingly cash flow positive, how are you thinking about use of cash with respect to maybe the balance sheet or respect to dividends or share buybacks as we go forward? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Eli that’s a top-of-mind question but it’s still a question that’s a little bit off in the future. We’re still we think deep in the midst of the investment cycle in the business. As I noted, the shallow upward recovery is a very solid backdrop for us to continue investing. I think it lends itself to a longer duration upwardly trending market. And we do continue to invest in significant land assets. What our pivot has really reflected more recently is that we’re kind of pulling down the duration of land that were purchasing and it is a slow process and one that is going to present itself over the next couple of years. But think in terms of over the next period of time, we’ll continue investing our capital in growing our business forward and just making sure that we’re not getting out over our skis in duration exposure. With that said, as we do become more cash flow positive and we will, as our ancillary businesses do start returning capital as we’ve already seen with Rialto and as we’ll start to see with some of the others as well, and as we lighten up on the percentage of our revenues that we’re reinvesting in land, cash will start to turn decidedly positive. And I think that we will take somewhat of an opportunistic view of the market thinking strategically about how to best deploy that capital, whether it’s in the form of dividends, stock buyback or some other form of investment, we’re going to keep an open mind and the management team will be considering it.
Bruce Gross: Yes, I guess I’d add one other thing is if you look at our land spend this year and fiscal 2014, you saw we were heavier in the first quarter and it’s been ticking down. First quarter we’re about 500 million, this last quarter we’re about 272 million. Contrary to that we’ve had increased spend on the development side and it really goes back to the opportunistic purchases that we had in the previous years and now we’re developing that property. We’re fortunate to not have to go out and buy land today and consistent with what we’ve said in the past, what we’re doing is we’re working with sellers out there and helping them entitle their land, tying it up without having to put actual dollars out. So that’s another example of the soft pivot that we’re doing.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. Just one quick follow up. Can you just remind us or at least in the last quarter, what percentage of your deliveries were from the new higher margin communities and what the delta is between those communities and your legacy? Thank you.
Bruce Gross: That percentage is somewhere around 80% now, Eli.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ivy Zelman from Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter, guys. I think big picture question first for Stuart and anyone else wants to opine on this, but then second I want the development activity. So first question recognizing it’s been a choppy market, Stuart, and as you very eloquently discussed the trajectory pointing upwards, can you give us a sense to why Lennar seems to be able to hit the ball down the fairway and consistently deliver good results and some of the differences, you don’t have to mention names, but there is clearly a dichotomy of performance and I think it’s an opportunity to talk about what you guys do differently? And prior to that, the second question, just quickly on development activity. There has been a lot of noted shortfalls in community new openings. It seems as if you’re also managing to still deliver on community count growth. Can you comment on delays and some of the impediments to getting that supply to market and if those delays are being worked through or mitigated, and what we should anticipate going forward on community count for the industry?
Stuart Miller: Starting with your first question, Ivy, I think you know well that I hold the competitive landscape in very high regard and I think that everybody’s – the large well capitalized builders, the strategies of the competitive field are all strong and viable and somewhat differentiated. Our strategy, which we’re quite pleased with, is very focused on a combination of good strategic land purchases and really hands-on community by community management. So as you know we got out ahead of the market in terms of land acquisition. We bought great strategic communities in really well located positions and we’ve been able to really leverage the harvesting of those communities, continue to leverage the community positions that we have. But I think that maybe the equally important component of this is our management structure and management team is very focused on a community by community basis of managing every day and the balance between volume, margin, SG&A spend, all of the components that drive and add to the decision making about pricing and incentives and everything else. The decisions are made on a daily basis in the field. They’re made cooperatively between division president, regional president and Rick and Jon respectively. It’s just a very active management program that is vibrant and very connected to the market in general. So that’s our structure and our program and we’ve been very pleased to be able to be balanced in the way that we approach the business to date. I think that you can expect a lot more of the same. As it relates to community count, it does get a little bit more difficult to develop communities going forward. I think that we’re pretty well advantaged by having loaded up on our community count early and gotten into the development and whatever entitlement necessities that were earlier. With that said, it’s still difficult to bring community count online. As I’ve told you and others before, community count is one of the most elusive parts of our business and it’s part of our balance. It takes a lot executive management to keep focused on it. I think we do an excellent job but it’s the component of business that continues to be a difficult part of management. Rick, maybe you’d want to add to that.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, probably the toughest thing out there to control, Ivy, is the volume going through the municipalities. The towns and cities still haven’t staffed up to date to handle the volume of the activity. And with regard to that, even on the housing side, there is buffers that we have to go through in order to get the approvals, not just the approvals on paper but the site approvals, the inspections. And fortunately we’re blessed because we have really great people. They try to stay ahead of it. The land development business is all about timing and knowing what to do, when to do it and what to expect. And I think we just have good people.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great. Well, enjoy your day. Congratulations.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital: Hi, guys. Congratulations on a strong quarter.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital: I had a couple of questions, not to take anything away from what you’ve done, but wanted to just ask about the SG&A. Over the last three quarters, the SG&A rate if you include corporate, hasn’t really changed much. I know you talked about the fact – you gave some of the reasons for that in your opening remarks and you talked about to some degree the ramping community count that you’ve been experiencing as being a reason why your improvement in SG&A hasn’t manifested itself yet. My question essentially is that if we assume that community count were to grow let’s say – continue to grow roughly at the rate that it’s been growing this year, would the likely impact of that be that SG&A improvement would probably be delayed for another year or so until that growth meaningfully decelerates or are there other factors that you think will allow your SG&A to start showing that sort of 7% incremental that you talk about even if your community count growth remains at let’s say about mid-teens kind of level?
Bruce Gross: Steve, this is Bruce. I’ll take that one. As you look at the community count growth and if you look at the SG&A numbers that we talked about today, the increased communities was the smaller portion of the explanation. So as we go forward, we are expecting to get the leverage and again, we’ve kind of laid out how we get that operating leverage because most of the growth is coming from existing divisions or existing communities. So we do expect to get that leverage and we don’t expect it to be deferred into some future year. We expect next quarter to get some leverage and going into 2015 to get additional leverage.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital: Bruce, if I could just sort of get you to talk a little bit more broadly about, I mean one of the things that we get pushback on and I’m sure you probably do too is the fact that for most builders that we talked too, the 125 to 225 basis points of leverage which some of your graphics would suggest you can achieve seems much higher, much, much more lofty goal than I think other builders would feel comfortable talking about. Some of that has to do with the fact that when you look historically, you guys carried perhaps a greater overhead structure than you intend to going forward and I think you talked about U.S. Home in the past playing a role in that. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on why Lennar may have sort of an outsized opportunity in SG&A versus peers?
Bruce Gross: Well, I think it starts with we already have a national platform. So as you’re comparing across the field, our focus for growth isn’t needing to go into new markets and that’s the more expensive component of SG&A. So in the past we did a lot of aggressive growing in the last decade and we’ve consolidated in the markets we want to be in and we’re now about 30 divisions. Our growth going forward is primarily coming from those 30 divisions where the incremental SG&A is around 7%. And I think that’s probably the biggest differentiator as we think about our program. That’s where most of the leverage will come from.
Stuart Miller: But more specifically to the question that you were asking, Steve, historically we were configured with multiple divisions in the same market. We’ve walked through that with many and we were about 124 different operating divisions across the country; sometimes two or three divisions in one geography. We used the downturn as an opportunity to really rethink the configuration of our operating platform and I think that Rick and Jon have done an extraordinary job of putting leadership in place in geographical places where we’re not going to have to expand into multiple divisions in order to grow this time. Instead, we think that we’re going to be able to comfortably grow. We’ll add a few divisions as we get larger and as geographies get a little bit stretched. But right now we’re 30 divisions. We were at a 124 and we might end up with 35, 40 divisions as we grow our volumes back remembering that the largest opportunity to grow volume and to leverage overhead still remains in recapturing a traditional four homes per community per month absorption rate, and we still haven’t seen that growth. So the ability to leverage overhead directly derives from the way that we’re structured today and we think that we have a hearty focused structure that can bear a lot more growth.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital: Great. Thanks very much. That was a great answer. Last question related to the apartment business. Did you retain an interest in those two apartment complexes that you sold off and can you talk a little bit about what you intend to do in terms of capturing value that you create beyond just the construction of and the lease up of the units as you go forward?
Stuart Miller: In the short term, as we’ve said in the past, Steve, we’re in a build to sell mode. We’ve been dealing with third parties; buying the land, starting a venture, constructing, developing and then selling the asset once it’s stabilized. And we’ve had two of those to-date. I think as we move forward into 2015, given that we’ve got ventures set up with the 19 things that are under construction or completed at this point in time, you’ll see a similar type of trajectory on those assets. We have not retained an ownership interest. We are working on some things where we hopefully will be able to maybe get a profit as well as continue to have an ownership interest but we haven’t set that up yet.
Jon Jaffe: Just to add to that, what we’re trying to articulate quarter-to-quarter is that we are going to define this business as a merchant-build business in order to prove the power of this backlog that we’ve been creating. You’re seeing the first evidence of that. This is a proving ground for what we have in our pipeline to demonstrate that number one, we have a strong pipeline; number two, we can design, build, lease-up, stabilize properties. And as we prove this property after property to a broader market, I think that the next thing that we will focus on is the opportunity that’s embedded in this pipeline of product that’s very desirable to the investment markets and we’ll take that opportunity and wrap some kind of a fence whether it’s a REIT or whether it’s a private equity program around it and have further monetization. But we said very clearly that step number one is to prove the platform and I think that we’re – you’re starting to see the proof.
Stuart Miller: There’s no question we could one way or the other. The true magic is can we get both and that’s what we’re focused on to create a platform where we can generate the income so it’s great for our stockholders on a current basis and predictable, but still have an ownership piece in these assets as NOI as we go forward.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital: Great. Thanks very much, guys, and good luck.
Operator: Your next question is from Stephen East from ISI Group.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Thank you. Congratulations, guys. Just to follow-on that a little bit, you say it was about 15 million – a little bit less than 15 million you profited. If I backed into it, you sold it for around 60 million. Is one, is that accurate? And two, what type of cap rate does that imply because I know, Stuart, you all have talked that you thought you would be able to capture that construction delta on the cap rate?
Rick Beckwitt: Steve, it’s Rick. We have continued to get in those two deals north of the 200 basis points spread on cap versus yield on cost. You’re somewhat in the ballpark with regard to proceeds. There were two different sales and the returns were really off the charts.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay so, so much better than the 25% that I’m sort of backing into there?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, you’re right.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. And you all move forward, you said it was late '15 that you thought you would be able to start rolling these out quarter-by-quarter and judging by what you’ve seen so far as you get later into '15 and '16 for these sales, does that hurdle rate 25% plus? Does it start to ratchet back down?
Rick Beckwitt: Starting with the hurdle rate, I don’t think it does. Everything’s been underwritten to that kind of IRR for us given that – remember that the structures allow us to promote as we work through the waterfall. With regard to potential sales for 2015, it’s probably going to be in the neighborhood of five to six apartment communities. We may see one in the first half of the year and the balance in the latter half of the year. The heaviest quarter would be the fourth quarter.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. And then, Stuart, in our field research we’ve seen not only you all but other builders starting to ramp up broker incentives more versus other type of incentives. And I guess I’m interested in what’s the rationale there, why that which could be true dollars out of the door versus some other things and what do you think happens as you go through call it the next six to 12 months as far as broker incentives versus other types of incentives?
Stuart Miller: Well, it’s an interesting question, Steve. The first thing that we have to recognize is that we live in a competitive world and a competitive field, and so in part we can be self determined and in part we still have to recognize what the competitive field is doing. So to the extent that the field moves in a direction, i.e. ramping up brokerage fees in order to keep within the acceptable ranges with the brokers, we might have to move in that direction too. I do recognize that our business is defined at a very local level. So in some markets you’re seeing some of the competitors move very much in favor of ramping up brokerage fees. I think that our view and the way that we’ve run our business is we’re probably behind others in how they’ve ramped up, but we still want to stay in the good graces of the brokerage community, so we really can’t fall too far behind in those select communities. So it really kind of comes down to the mechanisms by which some of the competitors might at moment in time in specific locations decide that they need to ramp up volume. So you’re seeing some of that move around as people define their business and define their strategies. And it’s not our preferred direction in terms of managing the pact, but at the same time we want to make sure that we stay in the good graces of the brokerage community. They are a vital part of our business.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Yes, fair enough, I get it on that. Do you think the incentives are above normal levels at the broker level right now?
Stuart Miller: Again, I just want to highlight that the way the question is framed, it’s almost like a national question and it is a very local kind of activity that we all average up to the national level. But what I really want to keep in your mind and people’s mind is that the market itself is kind of moving gently upwards but up and down along the way. And it has caused some and in some markets to really try to focus on driving volume at moments in time. So I think I would answer your question by saying that at times, it does get a little bit overheated both in incentives and in the fee for brokers. And at other times it curtails backwards. So it’s a moving evaluation rather than one that’s static and consistent. So I think a lot of it depends on – a lot of the answer to your question depends on how the market kind of gyrates up and down and people need to drive sales or competitors need to drive sales. It gets a little frothy at times; it pulls back. We try to remain pretty consistent and not move just directly in response but remember as it relates to brokers, we’re trying to stay in the game and make sure that we remain in the good graces in that part of our business.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I was just outside of Houston and Katy at a Cinco Ranch and we saw a lot of demand for EI product at the lower end of the price range and it seems like there is a lot of demand for first-time homebuyers. And I wanted to see if you a) are seeing a return of the first-time homebuyer and b) how you’re thinking heading into 2015 if the first-time buyer is coming back, the tradeoff between incremental operating leverage and mix?
Rick Beckwitt: Hi, Bob, it’s Rick. As we said in the past, we have been very focused on that first-time buyer and maybe I’ll give you a little bit of color as to what we’ve been doing over the last year and how it will play out in our operations within the next 12 months. We really view that first-time buyer as a sub 175, sub $200,000 price point. And let’s just take Texas as an example. As we move into 2015, under 200,000 we’ll have about 26% of our communities. In Dallas, it will be about 20%, Austin the same and the same with San Antonio. So we’ve been putting these positions together over the last year to really target that buyer. It’s a little bit tougher to get under 175, much, much tougher because of the land cost to get under 150, but we do view that as a very viable piece of the business. We still will have the higher price stuff, but you’ll start to see that move through in our closings.
Stuart Miller: I just want to go back to something I said in our opening remarks. We haven’t at all neglected the first-time buyer market. About 30% of our business overall is kind of geared towards that first-time buyer. We have that cork squarely in the water. Rick and Jon have been very focused on positioning the company to participate as that market returns, but let’s not underestimate. It’s still very difficult for that market to get reignited until we start to see a little bit more movement in terms of access to the mortgage market remembering that there are really three barriers to the first-time buyer coming back. First, it’s the down payment. Then it’s the very stiff underwriting and the bank overlays relative to accessing mortgage credit. And then finally the process itself has become fairly invasive, at least as far as people see the process and feel the process. And every time I say this to a group, there’s at least three or four people in the group that raise their hand and say, yup, I know what you mean by invasive. So the process is almost designed to scare people away. The barriers are a little bit steep right now. It’s going to moderate. And as I noted, we’ve got our cork squarely in the water and we’re ready to participate as the market really comes back in earnest.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets: I hope it does. Was going to ask Jon, you made some comments about FivePoint making some progress. It looks like the first phase at El Toro is set up. If you can give us a little bit more color what you’re seeing in terms of demand patterns both at El Toro and the shipyard just to give a view on southern and northern California, that would be great? Thanks very much.
Jon Jaffe: Bob, El Toro has remained very strong since we opened in October. We’re 80% sold out of 726 homes from the various builders in a very short period of time that covered the slowest part of the season as well. We’ve seen just continued strength in that market. Irvine is a very desirable location and we see strong demand from builders’ interest in our next phase there. In San Francisco, we haven’t opened models yet. That will happen later this quarter, but we’ve seen strong success with our presales which is just a very quiet program but steady demand, steady traffic, steady sales activity and a building interest. So we’re very encouraged by the early signals that we see there as well.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets: Are you still seeing good ASP growth?
Jon Jaffe: Yes, we are.
Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay, I think maybe we got time for one more.
Operator: Okay. Our final question today is from David Goldberg from UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thank you. Thanks for taking my call and good quarter.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
David Goldberg - UBS: I wanted to follow-up, Stuart, on your commentary in response to Bob’s question there about the entry-level buyer and the constraints that are coming in the mortgage market. And what I’m trying to get an idea of is how do you monitor those constraints and how that’s trending? So presumably you guys want to be a little bit proactive or more proactive than the other builders to kind of get out first or at least get out early to be on top of that. So what are you looking at to try to get an idea about what’s happening in terms of credit availability, and do you think you can get an advantage over the other builders in terms of maybe a little bit earlier by looking at some of the signals?
Stuart Miller: I think, David, that number one, the credit landscape is as I’ve basically described and that is deposit, credit underwriting and then the nature of the process, all being kind of defined and where they are. There has been some loosening of the credit underwriting at the margin, but it hasn’t been as significant as some has been reported. We stay very close to the customer in the field, we see who is coming in, we see what their commentary is. Remember that the rental market has accelerated in terms of its monthly payment requirement, it’s cost of living and that’s really driving people to say, I want to buy a home, I’d like to fix my cost, I’d like to find access to the mortgage market. So we’re watching what happens as they come in and staying very close to the purchaser in the field. Now with that said, the barriers are high and over time the market adjust to those barriers. People start saving, more down payment. They find a way; they get help from family. They start focusing on credit statistics as rental rates go up and they become more volatile because each year there is a re-pricing. People become ignited to get their credit credentials buffed and polished and ready for underwriting. They take a deep breath and they prepare themselves to go through the mortgage process. So you have two things kind of going in opposite directions. People are becoming more prepared and the mortgage market is opening up at the margins. And the only thing that we can really do is stay very close to the purchaser in the field, see what they’re seeing, feeling and finding as they try to access the new home market and use that as a guide post for really diving in and participating. Now, we’ve highlighted that we’ve gone out, we’ve tied up properties and positions that enable us to access the first-time market as it really starts to come back and we’re already very involved in the market. But the indicators to us that it is time to really start focusing on that market will come from the field at a very granular level.
David Goldberg - UBS: That’s very helpful. And then just as a follow-up question, it feels like you guys and maybe a couple of the other builders are gaining share from maybe broadly the other public builders and maybe some of the private builders. Do you think it’s true that you’re gaining share right now and the pie is relatively flat? And if so, do you think it’s sustainable as you go forward?
Stuart Miller: I think there is a reality right now and that is the credit landscape is tight. It’s not just tight for the purchaser looking to gain access to the mortgage market but it’s also been very tight for smaller builders and for traditional land developers to get back in the market and to do the things that they do. So I think the larger, well-capitalized builders with access to the land market in a more comprehensive way have been able to pick up market share and that is something that seems like it’s continuing going forward. Of course, the small builders are resourceful and find their way to participate, but I still think that the larger builders have a distinct advantage in the current market condition and I do believe that the pickup of market share is sustainable and will continue. I know you said that the pie is fairly static. It feels like over time the pie is going to be gently expanding as well, but with a gently expanding pie I think that you’re going to see pickup in market share as well.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. You’re welcome. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We’re sorry for those who weren’t able to get on. Of course, Bruce is available today to answer calls and we look forward to reporting again the end of our fourth quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter update. This morning, I am joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you have just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer are here as is Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto. And they will be available for Q&A today as well. Eric Feder isn’t here today, but then instead we have Brett Ersoff who runs our RMF Rialto Mortgage Finance Group. So, he is available also. Now, as is customary on our conference calls, I want to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and then briefly look at our operations. And then Bruce is going to provide greater detail. As always, we will open up to question and answers. And as in the past we would like to request that we limit ourselves to one question and one follow-up per person, so that we can leave as much time for people as possible. So, with that let me go ahead and begin. And let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to report another very solid quarter of performance for our company. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our company is positioned to be able to continue to perform extremely well in current market conditions due to a carefully crafted operating strategy. Generally speaking, the market continues a slow and steady recovery that is driven by limited supply of available homes both new and existing that are on the market, limited supply of land available to add to the supply of these homes and constrained demand from purchasers who would like to buy, but are unable to access the mortgage market. While many investors have been disappointed that the 2014 spring selling season did not have the steep vertical accelerations that had been anticipated, the market did continue to move slowly and steadily forward driving volume upward marginally and still driving pricing upward though at a somewhat slower pace. We continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of improvement in the housing market remain a steadily improving economy with a slowly improving employment picture unlocking pent-up demand while supplies remain constrained to meet that demand. We continue to believe that there remains a production deficit of both single and multifamily dwellings from the underproduction that took place during the economic downturn and up to and including this year and last. This shortfall is likely to continue to define the housing markets for the foreseeable future and will drive the housing recovery forward. Lennar has begun the first half of 2014 with very solid results as each of our businesses showed strong performance and are well-positioned in the thickest part of the market for continued future performance. The combination of solid management execution of our articulated strategies and strategic investments in core assets have combined to produce strong first half results and will enable continued industry leading performance throughout the year. Homebuilding of course remains our primary driver of quarterly performance. For the second quarter homebuilding revenues grew to $1.6 billion, up 29% over last year, while deliveries were up some 12% over the prior year. Maximizing our strong land position, we focused on balancing pricing power and sales pace while controlling costs and accordingly we produced 14.7% operating margin, 140 basis points year-over-year increase and the highest second quarter operating margin in the company’s history. Our sales pace in Q2 improved to 3.7 average sales per community per month, up from Q1’s pace of 2.8, but slightly lower than last year’s pace of 4 per community per month. Our average sales price of $322,000 was the year-over-year increase of $40,000 or 14%, this improvement in sales pace covered increases in labor, material and land costs improving our gross margin by the 140 basis points year-over-year to 25.5%. Our sales continue to benefit from the execution of our NextGen product strategy, year-over-year sales of our multi-generational brand grew by 58% totaling 368 sales in our second quarter. We now offered NextGen plans in 201 communities across the country and in our second quarter the average sales price for NextGen was 39% above the company’s average. We have continued to focus on homebuilding strategy on the move-up segment of the market as the first time home purchaser has not yet been able to access the mortgage market. Nevertheless, we are strategically positioned with both land and product to capture the first time home buyer demand when it is enabled by the mortgage market and it emerges with inevitable strong and pent up demand. Now complementing our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment continued to build its primary business along side the homebuilder and is working to replace the now diminished refi business with additional business across our national footprint. Bruce will talk a little bit more about our Financial Services progress which had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $18.3 million, though down from the $29.2 million last year when the refi business was thriving. While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer term value creation platforms for the company. We continue to be very pleased with the progress of our multifamily apartment business. As we have noted in the past this business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to become one of the leading developers of new Class A apartments in the United States. As homeownership rates have drifted downwards and as mortgage approvals have remained elusive for first time purchasers and as the large millennial generation begins to leave home and form households, this strategy continues to be an excellent complement to our primary for-sale homebuilding business. During the second quarter, we started development and construction on two additional apartment communities. We now have 17 communities of which two are completed and operating and two are partially completed and starting a lease-up program and the remaining 13 are under construction. These communities have approximately 4,500 apartments with an estimated development cost of approximately $1 billion. In addition to these communities, we have a geographically diversified pipeline that exceeds $3 billion and represents an additional 12,000 plus apartments. As we have discussed in the past, we are building these apartments with third-party institutional capital and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt. With our conservative financing and our conservative underwriting, we are positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than two times. And we anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next four years. Next, Rialto continues to make significant progress in transitioning from an asset-heavy balance sheet investor to a capital-light investment manager, commercial loan originator and securitizer. The initial direct investments were able to continue to return capital to Lennar in the second quarter and we believe we’ll return over $400 million of cash for us to recycle by the end of 2016. Our investment management and servicing platform is growing our assets under management and creating value for investors. We are continuing to build upon the base established with our first two real estate funds. Fund II is already – Fund I is already invested or committed. Fund I is already invested and Fund II is already invested or committed to invest almost $800 million of equity in approximately 60 transactions and has started making distributions of income to investors as well. We expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later on this year. And finally, Rialto Mortgage Finance, our high return on equity lending platform is originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash flow in commercial real estate properties. And we completed our seventh and eighth securitization transactions in the second quarter selling an additional $400 million of RMF originated loans bringing the total to almost $1.3 billion in only our first three quarters of securitization activity. In the second quarter, Rialto exceeded our expectations with operating results of $13.4 million this quarter, reflecting the continued maturity of a three different businesses and its positioning for strong 2014. Our FivePoint Communities Program continues to make significant progress as well in developing our premium California master plan communities. At El Toro, the first phase of 726 homes is over 75% sold out and the second phase of the 1,000 home sites will be sold to builders around the end of this year or the beginning of next year with a grand opening expected in late spring. At Newhall Ranch, we won two sequel lawsuits as well as an appeal of a lawsuit challenging our environmental permits this quarter. We expect any appeals to be concluded around the end of the year allowing us to begin development of the first 5,000 home sites there. And in San Francisco, we are opening the shipyard, Hunters Point, where we are pre-selling homes this quarter and will grand open models in August. Currently, about 250 homes are under construction and another 100 are scheduled to start this year. The venture will begin delivering these homes at the end of the year and the bulk of them delivering in 2015. Lastly, at Treasure Island, we are designing and processing land development engineering with an expectation to break ground in early 2016. Overall and in summary, our company is extremely well-positioned to succeed in current market conditions. We have an excellent management team that’s focused on a carefully crafted strategy that’s positioned us with an advantaged asset base that will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. Additionally, we have a well-diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses continued to mature. We are very pleased with our progress and performance and we are very pleased with the progress and performance in the second quarter and look forward to reporting our progress in our third quarter soon. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks, Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $0.61 per diluted share. The prior year’s earnings per share included a partial reversal of the state deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $0.18 per diluted share. The prior year’s EPS would be $0.43 after excluding the $0.18. Revenues from home sales increased 28% in the second quarter driven by a 12% increase in deliveries and a 14% year-over-year increase in average sales price to $322,000. In our earnings press release, we added additional disclosure by including average selling price by region. Please refer the press release tables to see this data. Our gross margin on home sales was 25.5% compared with 24.1% in the prior year. That’s the 140 basis point improvement that Stuart mentioned. Sales incentive improved by 80 basis points versus the prior year to 5.9% as a percent of home sales revenue or $20,300 per home delivered in the second quarter. Additionally we had $9.6 million of insurance recoveries and other non-recurring items which added 60 basis points to the gross margin percentage for the quarter. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues had additional leverage and improved 10 basis points to 10.8%. And with the improvement in both gross margin and SG&A our operating margins improved again up 140 basis points to 14.7%. In addition to this significant operating margin leverage we have also recognized operating leverage in our corporate G&A line which improved 30 basis points to 2.1% as a percentage of total revenues. Other interest expense declined from $25.1 million in the prior year to $10.3 million in the current quarter as we continued to open communities and increase the qualifying assets eligible for capitalization. This quarter we opened 95 communities and ended the quarter with 579 net active communities. We purchased 5,800 home sites during the quarter totaling $379 million. Our home sites owned and controlled now total 164,000 home sties. Turning to Financial Services, our Financial Services business segment delivered operating earnings of $18.3 million versus $29.2 million in the prior year. This is consistent with our previous guidance that Financial Services profitability would be lower due to a more competitive environment as a result of a significant decrease in the refinance transactions. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $16.7 million from $26.1 million in the prior year. Refinance originations declined 63% from the prior year. However, we were able to replace this loss volume with additional purchase originations to end the quarter with flat year-over-year origination volume at $1.4 billion. Although the volume is flat the heightened competitive pressure has reduced the profit per loan. Our in-house capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 77% this quarter and our title company had a $2.2 million profit in the quarter compared with the $3.7 million profit in the prior year. The reduction was primarily due to lower volume. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $13.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior year. Both amounts are a net of non-controlling interest. The composition of Rialto is $13.4 million of operating earnings by the three types of investments and these are before G&A expenses and Rialto interest expense are as follows. First, the investment management business contributed $28.4 million of earnings. This includes $17.9 million of equity and earnings from the real estate firms and $10.5 million of management fees and other. These numbers don’t include the carried interest which under a hypothetical liquidation increased by approximately $14 million for the quarter and is now at $104 million for Real Estate Fund I. Second, our new Rialto mortgage finance operations contributed $438 million of commercial loans into two securitizations resulting in strong earnings of $18.5 million for the quarter. Third, our liquidating direct investments and again these are the remaining assets in the FDIC and bank portfolios had a net loss of $1.6 million. This included our share of losses in the FDIC portfolio totaling $11.3 million which was primarily due to the share of impairments in the portfolio as a result of loan extensions and modifications extending and reducing the collections while partially offset by higher collections and gains on sales and the bank portfolios. Rialto G&A and other expenses were $24.3 million for the quarter and interest expense was $7.5 million. Rialto’s balance sheet had a strong liquidity position with $245 million of cash at quarter end. Multifamily results for the quarter are consistent with our expectations as we have net startup expenses of $7.2 million. Turning to our balance sheet, our balance sheet liquidity is strong. We ended the quarter with $638 million of homebuilding cash balances and no outstanding borrowings under our $950 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Yesterday, we announced that we completed an amendment to our credit facility increasing our facility to $1.5 billion, which includes $263 million accordion feature. The amendment increased our borrowing capacity and provided more flexible covenants while lowering our borrowing costs. We appreciate the support from the 17 banks in our facility. This revolver increases availability and coupled with our confidence in strong earnings power going forward enables us to continue to deploy more of the cash earning low returns on our balance sheet into high return investments. Our homebuilding net debt to total capital was 48%. Stockholders’ equity grew by 23% year-over-year to $4.4 billion this quarter. Our book value per share increased to $21.52 per share. There are three adjustments I would like to highlight in our 2014 goals. Number one, deliveries, we are maintaining our goal to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 homes for 2014. However, we are adjusting our backlog conversion ratio expectations between Q3 and Q4. We are adjusting Q3 to between 75% and 80% backlog conversion ratio due to the first quarter weather delays pushing some home completion dates into the fourth quarter. However, as a result, we are increasing our expected conversion ratio for the fourth quarter to between 95% and 100% conversion of the backlog. Second, gross margins we continue to expect our gross margins in 2014 to average 25% for the full year. And this excludes the insurance settlements highlighted in both the first and second quarter. We expect the third quarter to be in the high 24% range, while the fourth quarter should be just slightly over 25%. Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits still in the $30 million to $40 million range for the year. We expect a similar trend as we look at the second half of this year to the prior year with the third quarter delivering lower profits than the fourth quarter. We expect the timing of our Rialto Mortgage Finance securitizations to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. And let me just reiterate the reminder of our previously stated goals for 2014. We continue to expect approximately 25 basis points of potential improvement for SG&A for all of 2014 over 2013. Financial Services is still expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million of operating earnings. Our multifamily operations are still expecting startup losses of $15 million to $20 million, which includes one or two apartment community sales later this year. We are not expecting any significant joint venture or land sale activity in 2014 and these categories should be about breakeven. We haven’t changed our tax rate expectations for the year at 37% and our net community count is still expected to end the year in the range of 600 to 625 communities. With that, let me turn it over back to the operator for any of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could talk about community count by segment a little bit and just saw some of the trends there, you had some pretty divergent absorption paces across your different segments, so I just wanted to try to understand what was occurring in those a little bit better?
Jon Jaffe: Hi, it’s Jon Jaffe. We saw our community count growth the greatest in California and Texas, followed by Nevada and Colorado and it was a little slower this quarter in the East and then our Houston regions.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo: Okay. And then second question was on incentives, they have been relatively flat for four quarters in a row now roughly 6%ish, do you think that’s where they will stabilize or do you think there is more room for that to fall in the future?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon again. I think as we came out of the first quarter and we saw our sales pace pickup from 2.8 sales per month to 3.7, we found we didn’t have to use any additional incentives to achieve that sales pace and to maintain our margins. And we will continue to operate that way on a community by community basis. And it’s as expected, the market continues the slow and steady growth. You should expect that our incentive should be in that range.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo: Okay, thanks for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering I guess first in terms of the comments there on margins for the third and fourth quarter, is some of that driven by sort of the changes also in terms of backlog conversion and sort of some operating leverage there or is there an expectation that sort of absent those issues just that margins will be higher in the fourth quarter than the third?
Rick Beckwitt: This is Rick. We generally throughout the year see a progression in our margins from Q1 to Q4. Some of it has to do with what has been left in backlog that hasn’t converted as you pointed out. Typically as we move through the year we can push pricing, but our ability to raise prices is starting to slowdown given that the significant ramp up year-over-year in ASPs.
Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse: Okay, thanks. And then I guess the second question would be, we've have heard some other companies talk about somewhat favorable trends in March or relatively favorable for a bit of slowing in April and May, is that consistent with what you saw as the quarter went on?
Rick Beckwitt: With regard to sequential improvement, April was our least. It was sort of the slowest month, but not dramatically different than March and May. May was the strongest month on a year-over-year basis.
Dan Oppenheim - Credit Suisse: Okay, thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen East of ISI Group. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Thank you. Congratulations guys. Stuart, you talked a little bit about balancing out pace versus price. And if you look at what’s going on in some of the demand trends regionally, Houston jumps out at you, Southeast Florida and California. I was wondering what was going on in some of those key markets from a demand perspective and how you all are looking at pricing? Has pricing gone too far? I noticed three of your regions were down quarter-over-quarter on pricing. So, just trying to understand those relationships?
Stuart Miller: Let me start and then I will ask Jon and Rick to kind of jump in also relative to specific markets, but overall Steve, I’ve said a number of times that I think it’s really relevant that rental rates continue to run higher than fully loaded monthly payments on for-sale product and rental rates have continued to move up. So, there seems to be kind of a push on pricing across kind of the platform. And it’s moving in fits and starts a little bit as you go through the course of the year. And so it’s really incumbent on us and other builders as well to just carefully manage and stay close to the market as it relates to balancing pricing and pace. As noted, there is not a lot of land available to replace communities that are depleted. So, as rental rates are moving, it’s kind of dictating a little bit, where pricing is going on the for-sale side of the business. The for-sale side could probably ramp up volume a lot more, if it held pricing back, but the replacement of communities is very difficult. Land values as you know are stronger than they have been, so that balance of pace and price is a very local matter, each market is a little bit different. But if you take kind of a 30,000 foot view the general trend is still towards the upside.
Jon Jaffe: And this is Jon, Steve. I would add that even within markets, sub-markets can be very different and we do watch this balance very carefully community by community. But as you noted our California was up both in – our growth in community count and sales pace and margin and that market has definitely felt stronger during the quarter than some other markets. Florida, Southeast Florida was also up in average sales price year-over-year, not so much in community count. So we just managed those differently based on what we see in the marketplace, based on what we are bringing online. And also the overall market growth in the community count. So for example Phoenix which we all know was softer had tremendous community count growth in the overall marketplace with sort of flattish activity and that’s why you saw sales pace drop in the Phoenix and accordingly you didn’t see any price appreciation there.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. That’s helpful. And Stuart you mentioned about land buying and it makes it a bit tougher. As you look at your house price appreciation stagnates in all of that, what are you seeing as the implications on the land side and what you are seeing that pencils that type of thing and are you now at the point where entry level land is becoming more and more of a focus as you move forward?
Stuart Miller: Well, look I think you always have to keep in mind that land value is a residual of what you can build on it. Land values don’t really just move aggressively on their own, sometimes they get ahead of themselves just like any other pricing mechanism. But at the end of the day it’s all a residual calculation of what you are going to be able to build on the land, what market is going to desire a particular location that’s going to drive what products you build on the land and what you can afford to pay for it. And ultimately land prices find their way to that kind of equilibrium. So on a market by market basis and within markets in particular locations land prices move sometimes with momentum and pull back a little bit. It’s been my experience and I think it’s the experience in the marketplace today that we are able to continue to purchase land for a product that is going be able to be built on that land. And whether it’s for first-time buyers maybe a little farther out from the best locations or whether it’s for the move-up buyer in the A locations, it really comes down to a residual calculation. Rick maybe you could add some color to that.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, I think in your response – the other thing I would point out Steve is that we continued to be contracting and tying up parcels one year, two years out, so we still have the ability to buy on a wholesale basis. If you look at our land cost as a percentage of ASP it stayed relatively constant in that 20% to 21% of sales price which allows to have a really strong margin. We noticed in the quarter that our land development spend increased pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis. And that’s really the – that’s really evidencing the fact that we have got some land and we tied up or moving that through the process right now which gives us a lot of confidence that our margins are going to be holding up pretty good.
Stuart Miller: At the end of the day as you see home prices move up you are probably seeing land prices move up. If land prices move up with a little bit more momentum and home prices stagnate those land prices are going to drift back downward ultimately as well. So I think that our margins able to still strive even as home prices might not be accelerating quite as much as they were.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Eli Hackel of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. First question just wanted to focus on multifamily for a minute, pipeline continues to grow pretty aggressively, you said you would be able to be a little bit more consistent I guess in the second half of next year. I was wondering what was driving that, were you able to find the long-term land partner, are these buildings already sold and that what gives you the confidence. And I just wanted to confirm I know in the past you said you are able to generally get maybe 150 basis point spread from the build to self cap rate, is that still generally the case?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. This is Rick. I think what gives us the visibility in the consistency of the earnings going into the back half of 2015 really stems from when we started our communities. As Stuart highlighted in his opening remarks today we have about 17 communities that are either complete, two of which are completed the rest of which are under some stage of construction. As we look at the balance of this year we will probably start an additional 20 communities plus or minus and that gives you the sort of a runway with regard to how long it takes to build, lease them up and stabilize and then potentially sell them. So we know when we have started and we will see where the lease up progression is and that allows us to really track the building cycle and when we can sale up.
Stuart Miller: Let me add to that and say, I think about our apartment business as kind of a manufacturing plant. It has a fairly long lead time in production and the startup period which we are going through now takes probably 2.5 years to from start to stabilization and sale of an apartment community. The startup period has been a couple of years in the making. We are just getting to the point where we’re delivering our first few coming off the assembly line. And as we get to the back half of 2015, we started to have enough product that has been started is in the pipeline and is moving through in orderly fashion to where we are going to be able to refine the visibility that we can bring from this part of our company. Now the long lead time in today’s market where rental rates have been moving up fairly aggressively and it seems like they are going to continue to really reflects on our initial underwriting having been low and our execution likely to be very strong.
Rick Beckwitt: And the second part of your question was yield on cost versus exit cap. We are still targeting that 150 basis point to 200 basis points.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Great, that’s extremely helpful. And then just quickly one follow up Stuart just want to get your latest thoughts on lending standards and maybe what you are seeing over the past couple of months suppose maybe now what’s speeches you have talked to some of friends in the banking sector?
Stuart Miller: Lending standards are still tight. It’s going to be interesting to see how the change in leadership at the FHFA is going to actually translate to the market. We still have the stickiness I think of a banking and mortgage banking industry that is having difficulty getting over the penalty phase of the downturn that we have endured and that penalty Phase is really relevant and because to the extent that people see or they put back risk is great and really political and social risk is also great meaning reputational risk it’s hard for the lenders to get back in the business lending on a rational and reverted to normal kind of underwriting standard. I have listened to a number of people speak recently from various parts of the government and there is this kind of consistent reframe that we need to loosen mortgage standards. But we don’t want to go back to the excesses of 2006. Every time I hear that we don’t want to go back to excesses of 2006, the fact that they throw that caveat in there is reflective of the fact that they don’t realize just how far field we are from that. And that reversion to normal is indeed even close to them. And so I feel that that’s still an impediment to a big move and opening up liquidity in the mortgage market. I think it’s going to be a slow after margin adjustment that’s going to take place over time. Now on the negative side, it means it’s going to be difficult to really liberate the first time homebuyer and get them back into the marketplace. On the positive side relative to us, people need a place to live and our rental program still looks very attractive to us.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: That’s extremely helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thanks. I appreciate guys taking the call and good morning. I am – I wanted to ask a bit of a theoretical question, I guess and it’s delving a little bit into the comments that you made, Stuart, about being well-positioned for when the entry level comes back and having the right land position to meet that buyer segment? And what I am trying to figure out is there is so much uncertainty about what the entry level coming back is going to look like? And I am trying to figure out how you underwrite land positions accordingly. I mean, we don’t know what price is going to look like, we don’t know what absorptions are going to look like. And so I am just trying to get an idea as you do buy new land that focuses on the entry level where you don’t necessarily have great comps in kind of nearby communities, how do you think about risk control in that environment?
Stuart Miller: I am going to turn this over to Rick and then Jon, because they have in their areas really crafted our land strategy. And we have navigated these waters pretty well to-date thinking about where the market is going and crafting a land strategy to that. And likewise, relative to a first time homebuyer strategy, I think that they have been completely on top of this and thinking it through comprehensively. So, Rick, why don’t you start?
Rick Beckwitt: Okay. It really has to do with price and affordability and commuting corridors if you will. We have taken a very, not aggressive, but thoughtful path in tying up a bunch of property that we could ultimately build on. So, most of the stuff that we are talking about is smaller, it’s money deposits where we have tied up parcels of land, some of which is finished, some of which is would need to be developed with an aim towards building relatively low-priced homes in those markets for the first-time buyer. We know where the commuting path will be. We have a good idea of how far they want to drive. They aren’t in the heart of where our current communities are, because the land isn’t priced accordingly. And we have just done a lot of market research to see where things would comp out and appraise and more importantly focused on what we need to put into the homes to construct them at a price to sell them to them at a good value, but that’s essentially what we have been doing.
Jon Jaffe: And then in the West, David, it’s a strategy really leads us to the product that we have been focusing on, because the price of the land tends to be a lot higher. There isn’t the quick availability, like Arizona, Texas, where the strategy is well-executed that Rick articulated for that land. So, that the market, the thick part of the market is really the move-up market today and that’s where our land buying strategy has been focused. And we keep a very close eye on the tertiary markets, which will feed that first time buyer market as to what’s available and how to bring it on, but we are not really taking the risk today and until that market presents itself as more viable.
Stuart Miller: So, I think what you heard in my comments is we are fully aware that there is a first time homebuyer market out there that is waiting to be able to be activated. It is dependent on mortgage lending standards opening up kind of reverting to normal. We have recognized that once it’s activated, it is a market that has a great deal of pent-up demand. We also recognized that today’s millennial generation has not yet quite defined itself. Is it going to be focused on something that’s more in the middle the city focused or are they going to be building their family by getting married and having children maybe a little bit later in life, but nonetheless still looking for suburban lifestyle. We have developed a land strategy that’s really crafted on creating as much optionality for ourselves in that space as possible looking at different alternatives and preparing products for when that market presents itself. But with that said we are focused on a current basis on the deepest, thickest part of the market which is the first time move up and regular move up buyer and we stand ready to address the first-time buyer as they are activated.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thank you for the color. That’s very helpful. As a follow-up I was wondering if you guys can talk about cycle times and I guess the question as you know with the weather-related delays and some of the push in closings to fourth quarter, are you finding opportunities to cut cycle times in more of a flat market now relative to where we were – when we were maybe growing a little bit more quickly?
Jon Jaffe: Hi, this is Jon, David. I don’t think that the weather really affected cycle times, it did push things out. I would say what we are seeing as the markets mature is cycle time is flattening. In some places we are able to improve it a little bit and in some places it might slide a little bit. Labor, varies by market as well and most of our markets labor is stabilized which allows us to stabilize the cycle time and in Texas we have seen a lot of activity, labor is tighter and so it’s a little bit harder there. So really the market by market issue is a big focus of our company, cycle time from a perspective of the quality of the home and the quality of process for our homebuyers. And we are trying to find ways to be more efficient, but in general I would say it’s just pretty stable out there.
David Goldberg - UBS: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Good morning guys. Good quarter. Stuart you talked about the demographics and short-term strategy with multifamily being obviously another say tool in your tool box and I believe you told me at one point that maybe Rialto you had several hundred units that were single-family rented, I am wondering what your view on single-family rental is given the more cautious view you have of the renting environment normalizing and whether or not that would be an added part of your growth strategy going forward as you appreciate the deficit in shelter?
Stuart Miller: Well, first of all yes. We probably had single-family rentals through our Rialto, distress portfolios before the rest of market really focused on it. And we had a real opportunity to look at how scattered single-family homes would rent and how they would be managed and of course that business has taken off and it’s been a very successful part of some large fund managers operations and programs going forward. I still think that there are complications in managing a diverse array of products and buildings that are located in scattered locations. But given the fact that we have a long-term production deficit in this country in terms of the amount of homes multi and single-family homes that have been delivered over the past few years since we went into the downturn and we kind of estimate that that’s about $4 million in deficit over the past few years. It seems to me that all product types high tide is rising out both all product types are going to continues to do okay and be pretty strong simply because there is a demand for places for people to live and there is a scarcity of that shelter. So the single-family rental opportunity is a good one. I think it’s difficult to manage. But it’s highly, highly desirable for people who are growing families and need a place to live. The desire to live in the single-family dwelling is very attractive and the inability to get a mortgage augers in favor of renting versus purchasing. So even with the difficulty of management that business is strong. Our apartment business we think is a very strong business. It’s easier and efficient to manage. We think that our bottom line is going be very strong. And whether there is an opportunity in the future to do single-family for rent is something that we have looked at, it’s something that we are considering and we will see as we go forward. I think a little bit of that and the answer to that will depend on how the mortgage market evolves in the near-term. You know that it’s my view that it’s evolving fairly slowly. I know that there are those including yourself, Ivy that think that it might be coming on a little bit faster. And I leave a lot of room for that to possibly play out more the way other see it than the way that I see it, but if it doesn’t, then I think the single-family development for rent might become a part of our program going forward.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great, that’s very helpful. I guess my second question really pertains to the level of incremental supply that’s coming through the top MSAs, where you compete and maybe Jon or Rick can comment on this question? There has been a lot of concern about the level of supply in Phoenix and the pressure that we have seen given the softness in sales and level of pricing pressure. Are there other markets that you think are at risk or do you think there was more of anomaly that Phoenix had some specific drivers that mitigate that in other markets sort of similarly following, I know Stuart you have commented very, very eloquently that there is a very significant deficit of supply, but we do have a lot of growth from the industry as they have loaded up their pipelines with developed lots that they are now going to be opening double-digit increases throughout the builder community for new stores. So, are there any markets that you think that will be following Phoenix’s slowing?
Stuart Miller: I think Phoenix was somewhat of an outlier, Ivy. In that, you had as you know significant price appreciation in the prior year and it led to a lot of activity of bringing new communities online at a time where that price depreciation couldn’t be sustained and volume did not pick up as expected. And I think there are some political factors in Arizona that affected that as well that slowed down job growth from where we thought it was going to be. Don’t see those kind of dynamics in other places. And in the West, it’s not so easy to bring land on fast. I really don’t see that, in Texas, where you can bring land on a little quicker, the absorptions are really kept pace and the job growth is really strong. So, I think in a market like Texas, they don’t see that risk either.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Can I sneak in one quick one just on absorption pace, you said 3.7, I think you said slow and steady recovery, Stuart. What’s the right – what would be this right number for us to think of a normal pace per community, because we used to think 3.5 to 4 was normal?
Stuart Miller: Yes. I think historically 3.5 to 4 is kind of the normal zone, but I think that 1.5 million starts per year is the normal zone also and there are lot of normal historical patterns that we are not seeing right now. I think going back to your prior question and answering this one as well, I think we have got to think in terms of ebb and flow in the market – in the market that we are in. We are going to see markets that get a little ahead of themselves. Pricing is an area that starts to move very quickly and you end up with sticker shock that can be coincident pricing and interest rate sticker shock as interest rates move back and forth. Purchasers in certain markets might find that they want to purchase, but they just can’t get over the sticker shock for a period of time. I still think that the dominant theme is production deficit. And over time, I think there was going to be an evening, a reversion back to some of the more normal trends like a 3.5 to 4 homes per community per month absorption rate, but I think that we are still going to see it ebb and flow as markets kind of find their way to slow steady recovery, but pricing gets ahead of itself or desirability falls off for a period of time. And we will just have to kind of wade our way through some of these numbers.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Do you expect the pace of year-over-year orders growth to pickup in the back half since comps get somewhat easier than what we have seen in the first half?
Stuart Miller: We would expect that would likely be the case, Jade, but we’ll have to wait and see how the market unfolds.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Okay, thanks. Switching to Rialto, I just want to find out if you could comment on the timing of recognizing the carried interest into income? And also if you could comment on what drove the sequential pickup in joint venture income?
Stuart Miller: The carried interest, Jade, we would expect to be able to book that once it’s served in, which is when it comes in, which we still expect on Fund I to be out in the 2016 timeframe at the earliest.
Jeff Krasnoff: Yes, this is Jeff. I would confirm that 2016/2017 before they start coming in. And then what drove the joint venture income was the fair value in the funds, that’s coming from our real estate funds primarily. So, each quarter we go through a fair value and whatever that increase in value is, is booked through the equity and the earnings line.
Stuart Miller: Yes. And the fair value includes actual operating earnings as well from the ventures. So, it’s really the bottom line of the ventures and it’s our share of the – as a limited partner in those ventures and we had a good couple of quarters.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Okay. So it’s essentially your 15% interest in the funds?
Stuart Miller: Yes, it’s less than that. It’s about 11% in the first fund and about 8% in the second fund.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Okay, thanks a lot.
Stuart Miller: Thank you. And in difference of those who want to watch the soccer game, I think it starts at noon, doesn’t it? I think we will take one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. You mentioned limited land availability in the release and so I wanted to see if you could walk us through what you meant by that? Is this in specific geographic areas or is this like infill or are you talking about developed lots, some further clarity on that would be great?
Stuart Miller: Sure. I think that it’s been well-documented that as we went through the downturn, just like the homebuilders were impaired, every land developer or land purchaser found their positions to be impaired and the downturn basically shutdown all entitlement and development activity. And of course, you don’t just restart that engine development and entitlement take years, especially in your most desirable markets. It actually takes years and it takes capital. So, there has been some land that has come back to the marketplace, but the entitlement process and the development process has been very slow to start. Those that are well-capitalized can engage these processes, but there have been fewer groups, primarily the large homebuilders that do have the capital to undertake undeveloped land and get that land position for actually getting building permits. Smaller landowners, historically, active developers have not been able to get engaged in the financing market and therefore have not assumed their traditional role of developing land that’s available for builders to be able to build. So, land continues to be tight across the country, particularly in the markets where land entitlement is most constrained as places like California, places like Florida, the entire Eastern seaboard number of places, it’s very hard to get land activity up and running again. And that’s what produces the constraint. And the land of course that is available and is developed or entitled becomes much more expensive, because there is a shortage and a need to build in some of those areas.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. And one other question I had was since you guys are uniquely positioned to be, you have the single-family and the multifamily perspectives, what are your thoughts on the share of multifamily as a percentage of overall starts going forward? As firstly we kind of meet a mid-cycle level call it maybe 1.5 million in a few years, do you think that the multifamily side is going to have a greater share than in prior cycles or do you think that kind of what’s going on now with rents rising at a fairly rapid pace that’s going to kind of die out at a certain point and then you were going to have a much of kind of a normal single-family percentage of total starts kind of call it mid-cycle?
Stuart Miller: I think it’s an interesting question and we are all going to have to stay tuned. Right now, multifamily is making up about a third of all starts, which is an historical high, but realistically, multifamily is operating or trending to exactly its traditional zone of 300,000 to 400,000 starts per year. It’s just that single-family is awfully low right now. And so we are as an industry we are going to have to wait and see a lot of it depends on how the mortgage market evolves and whether it begins to enable the buyer to come back to the market, especially the first time buyer to come back to the market. As things stand right now, if you think about the math we have trended in homeownership from a high of 69.2% homeownership rate down to something like a 64.7% homeownership rate. And every 1 percentage point move in homeownership rate translates into 1.3 million households either doubling up or looking for a rental. So, we have shifted a lot of demand away from for-sale and into the rental housing market. Some have articulated the belief that the homeownership rate will continue to fall. There are some outliers that say that it could fall as low as 55%, I don’t believe that, but whether it continues to trend the percentage point of the time, we will have to wait and see, but that will define the percentage of total starts that are multifamily or primarily rental versus for-sale.

Stuart Miller: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter update. This morning, I’m joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you’ve just heard from; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt here with me this morning, who is our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, both joining for the Q&A session. We also have Eric Feder here who facilitates our deal flow across our operating platforms and whose birthday it is today and he will join us for Q&A today as well, Happy Birthday, Eric; and Jon Jaffe is available by telephone. He is our Chief Operating Officer and he is in California. As is customary on our conference call, I want to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the housing market and then briefly overview our operation. And then Bruce is going to provide greater detail on our numbers and some additional comments on financial services segment. And then as always, we will open up to Q&A. As in the past we’d like to request that during the Q&A session each person limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. So let me go ahead and begin and let me begin by saying that we are very pleased to report that we’ve been able to begin our 2014 year with a solid first quarter start. Our company is very well-positioned to be able to continue to perform extremely well due to our well-crafted strategy and tied to a clear view of general market conditions. In our year end and fourth quarter conference call, we reported to you that we have seen a clear pause in the rate of recovery in the housing market and while prices had continue to appreciate volume had clearly subsided. In the first quarter, we have seen clear signs that volume is returning to the market, even as severe weather made conditions difficult. As we moved past the seasonally slowest month of the year end, we began to see both traffic and sales volume begin a steady month-by-month improvement throughout the quarter. The progression through our fourth quarter of 2013 and into our first quarter of 2014 continues to fuel our confidence and our belief that the housing market recovery continues as we begin to enter the more vibrant seasonal month of the year. We continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of improvement in the housing market remain a steadily improving economy with a slowly improving employment picture unlocking pent-up demand, while supplies remain constrained to meet that demand. We continue to believe that there remains a production deficit of both single-family and multifamily dwellings from underproduction during the economic downturn and up to an including last year. This shortfall will continue to define the housing markets for the foreseeable future and will drive the housing recovery forward. Accordingly, the builders of both multi and single-family products will continue to increase production as inventories have remained extremely low and pent-up demand comes to the market. And even as the market respond, inventories are likely to remain constrained as production increases are limited by shortage of entitled and developed land to build on in desirable location. While we recognize the potential headwind from a constrained and sometimes uncertain mortgage market, including interest rate volatility and sometimes volatile consumer confidence and also diminishing investment purchasers in the retail market. We feel that the fundamentals of short supply of available home and pent-up demand will continue to define our strategy of land acquisition and growth and drive the recovery forward. Against that backdrop, Lennar has begun 2014 with very solid first quarter results as each of our business -- businesses showed strong performance in the first quarter and are well-positioned for the future. This speaks both to the solid management execution of our articulated strategies and to the positioning of our company for continued performance throughout the year. Now homebuilding, of course, remains the primary driver of our quarterly performance. For the first quarter, homebuilding revenues grew to $1.2 billion, up 42% over last year, as we continue to focus on maximizing pricing power. Deliveries were up some 13% over the prior year. Our sales pace in the first quarter averaged 2.8 sales per community per month, which was essentially flat compared to last year. We opened 60 new communities and closed out 49 during the quarter to end at 548 active communities, which is a 13% year-over-year increase. And our absorption pace in sales improved sequentially through the quarter with the sales in the quarter up 10%, while new order dollar value was up 26%. In the West, where we were not impacted by weather and where we were able to open new communities, our sales were up 45% year-over-year and 40% -- and 47% on the community count growth. Our Western operations made up for some of the markets that were hardest hit by severe weather conditions during the quarter. We continue to focus on maximizing our pricing power. Our average sales price is $316,000 was a year-over-year increase of $47,000 or 18% and a 3% sequential increase from the fourth quarter. This improvement in sales prices covers our increases in labor, materials and land cost, improving our gross margins by 300 basis points to year -- 300 basis points year-over-year to 25.1%. Year-over-year, labor and material costs are up 9.8% to over $47 a square foot and sequentially this is less than a 1% increase from the fourth quarter as lower lumber prices from previous quarters were reflected in this quarters result. We continue, however, to see cost increases in some of the materially -- material, most notably, drywall, lumber and siding that will begin to impact our second quarter deliveries. However, we did see an easing on the labor pressure in many other markets. With SG&A of 11.8%, we continue to improve our operating leverage, as this is 20 basis point year-over-year improvement. This operating leverage combined with our pricing power produced a 13.2% net operating margin for the quarter and -- which is a 310 basis point improvement year-over-year. We’ve continued our focus on cost effective marketing with total Lennar online visits in Q1 increasing 39% year-over-year and this quarter we also surpassed over 1 million social media followers. I’d like to also point out that our bottom line performance has greatly benefited from the execution on our NextGen product strategy. Year-over-year, sales of our multigenerational brand grew by 57% and accounted for 5% of our new orders in Q1. We now offer our NextGen plan in 178 communities across the country and in Q1 the average sales price for NextGen was about $450,000. During the fourth quarter, we continued our carefully crafted land acquisition program and purchased approximately 8,800 homesites for $505 million, while we spent $226 million on land development for the future. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 33% over the prior year period. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets where we saw the best opportunities and the best returns. As quarter end, we owned and controlled approximately 154,000 homesites and as I mentioned before, had 548 active communities. As we noted in our last conference call, we expect to be able to increase community count by approximately 15% over the course of 2014. As we look ahead to 2014 and beyond, we are fortunate to -- to the remainder of 2014 and beyond, we are fortunate to have land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through this year and for all of next year and this positions us very well to maintain gross margins that are consistent with our first -- reported first quarter margin for the remainder of the year. Our fourth quarter performance highlights very strong management execution, but also indicate how well-positioned we are for future performance driven strong -- by strong operating strategy, complemented by an excellent management team and excellent management execution. Complementing our homebuilding operations, our financial services segment continues to build its primary business alongside the homebuilder and its working to replace the now diminished refi business with a vibrant retail business across our national footprint. Bruce will talk more about financial services progress which had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $4.5 million though down from $16.1 million last year when the refi business was thriving. While our Homebuilding and Financial Services division are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our three additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to make significant progress in transitioning from an asset heavy balance sheet investor to a capital wide investment manager, commercial loan originator and securitizer. Rialto today is involved in three different businesses. Our first is the direct investment business where we were able to return or will return shortly over $120 million in cash to the partners in those initial investments, including almost $50 million to Rialto. Our goal is to monetize the bulk of these assets by the end of 2016, generating over $400 million of cash for us to recycle. The second area is our growing investment management and servicing platform. Our objective here is to grow our assets under management and create value for investors. We’re continuing to build upon the base established with our first real estate fund and during the quarter, we completed the race for Rialto Real Estate Fund II closing out with $1.3 billion of equity commitments. And Fund II is already invested or committed to invest approximately $700 million in approximately 50 transactions and has started making distributions of income to investors as well. We expect to begin raising our third real estate fund later this year. And finally our third business is Rialto Mortgage Finance, our high return on equity conduit lending platform. RMF as we refer to it, is focused on originating and securitizing long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash flow and commercial real estate properties. During the first quarter, we completed our fifth and sixth securitization transactions selling an additional $250 million of RMF originated loans bringing the total to almost $1 billion in only our first two quarters of securitization activity. In the first quarter, Rialto exceeded our breakeven expectations with a $2.6 million profit and is well positioned for a strong 2014. As with Rialto, we’re very pleased with the progress of our multi-family apartment business. As we’ve noted in the past, this business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to be one of the leading developers on new Class A apartments in the United States. As homeownership rates have drifted downward and the large millennial generation begins to lead home and form households, this strategy continues to be an excellent complement to our primary for-sale homebuilding business. During the first quarter, we started development and construction on three additional apartment communities. We now have 15 communities of which two are completed and operating and two are partially completed and leasing. And the remaining 11 are under construction. These 15 communities have approximately 4,000 apartments with an estimated development cost of approximately $835 million. In addition to these communities, we have a geographic re-diversified pipeline that exceeds $2.8 billion and represents an additional 11,600 apartments. As we’ve discussed in the past, we are building these apartments with third-party institutional capital and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt. With our conservative financing and our conservative underwriting, we are positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than two times. We anticipate with the construction -- we anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next four years. Finally, our FivePoint Communities program continues to mature as a long-term strategy as well and is quickly moving to bring developed land in our premium California locations to the market to fill the growing demand for well located, approved and developed home sites. Overall and in summary, our company is extremely well positioned to succeed in the current market conditions. We have an excellent management team that’s focused on a carefully crafted strategy that has positioned us with advantage to assets that will continue to drive industry-leading profitability. Additionally we have a well-diversified platform that will continue to enhance shareholder value as our ancillary businesses mature. We are very pleased with our progress and performance -- we’re very pleased with our progress and performance in the first quarter and we look forward to reporting progress on a very successful 2014 year ahead. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thanks Stuart and good morning. Our net earnings for the first quarter were $0.35 per diluted share versus $0.26 in the prior year. Our earnings before income taxes were $126 million which was an increase of 136% over the prior year. Let me add a little color to the numbers starting with Homebuilding. The 13% increase in deliveries resulted in a backlog conversion ratio of 75% for the quarter. This was within our previously announced goal for the quarter despite the tough weather conditions that Stuart mentioned. The 18% increase in average sales price to $316,000 is broken down by region as follows. The East region was $279,000, up 11%. Southeast Florida was $341,000, up 26%. Central region was $266,000, up 3%. Houston was $278,000, up 8%. The West region was 413,000, this was up 41% and although they had a sizable increase in average sales price, they also benefited from some favorable product mix. The other region was $385,000, up 13%. Our gross margin on home sales which Stuart highlighted was up 300 basis points to 25.1%. This improvement was driven by a couple of things. Sales incentives were $21,300 per home in the quarter and that was a year-over-year improvement of 170 basis points. It came down from 8% in the prior year to 6.3% as a percentage of the home price. The gross margin percentage improved in the East, Southeast Florida, Houston and West regions during the quarter and the highest gross margin was in the Southeast Florida region. Additionally during the quarter, we received an insurance settlement totaling $5.5 million, which favorably impacted the gross margins. In addition to the significant operating leverage mentioned earlier, we have additionally recognized operating leverage in our corporate G&A line as our corporate G&A improved 40 basis points to 2.8% and this is as a percentage of total revenues. During the quarter, we closed $91 million of land sales totaling $16 million of profit. $65 million of these land sales were from mothballed assets which were strategically sold to redeploy the capital into near-term producing assets with favorable operating margins. Additionally in one of these sales, Lennar will be the developer and will earn approximately $7 million in fees over two-year period starting in 2015. Our ending community count increased to 548. However, there were about 16 communities that were shifted into Q2 as a result of a delay due to weather conditions. Turning to Financial Services. This segment generated operating earnings of $4.5 million versus $16.1 million in the prior year. This is in line with our year end conference call comments that we expected Financial Services earnings to be below $5 million for the first quarter. Mortgage pretax income decreased to $6.5 million from $16.4 million in the prior year. The decrease in profitability was primarily due to an 83% decrease in refinance loan origination volumes which also resulted in margin compression as more competitors focused on the purchase business. Mortgage originations declined 25% from the prior year to approximately $900 million and we captured 75% of Lennar homebuyers using mortgages for their purchase. Our title companies also experienced a significant reduction in refinanced transactions and in this quarter, which is the seasonally slowest quarter of the year, they had $1.6 million loss compared with $300,000 profit in the prior year. Turning to the Rialto segment. They generated operating earnings of $2.6 million compared to $1.7 million in the prior year. Both of these amounts are net of non-controlling interest. The composition of Rialto’s operating earnings by the three types of investments are as follows, the direct investments which is the FDIC and bank portfolios had a net loss of $1.6 million, the investment management business contributed $5.8 million of earnings and these numbers don’t improve the carried interest which are under a hypothetical liquidation, increased by $9 million for the quarter and is now at $90 million. We expect this number to continue to grow and isn’t recognized as income until proceeds are actually received. Our new Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed $253 million of commercial loans into two securitizations, resulting in the earnings of $3.1 million for the quarter and this is net of their respective G&A. Additionally, there was $1.1 million of management fees, which is net of remaining Rialto, G&A and others. Interest expense for the quarter increased to $5.7 million due to the issuance of $250 million of senior notes in the fourth quarter. Our Rialto balance sheet is very well positioned today. They ended the quarter with $169 million of cash and subsequent to the quarter end, we completed a $100 million add-on to the initial $250 million five year unsecured notes that we closed at the end of last year. This add-on was done at an effective interest rate of 6.31%. The Multifamily segment results for the quarter are consistent with expectations, as we have met start-up operating expenses of $6.2 million. Our balance sheet liquidity is strong. We ended the first quarter with $646 million of Homebuilding cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $950 million unsecured revolving credit facility. We issued $500 million of senior notes due June 2019 in the quarter. This reduces our borrowing cost and also fits well into our debt maturity ladder. Our Homebuilding net debt to total cap was 48.5% and we received positive outlook upgrades from both S&P and Moody’s during the first quarter. Our book value per share at the end of the quarter increased to $20.84. Finally, let me summarized what we said on this call and revisit the 2014 goals from our year end conference calls. First, with deliveries, we are maintaining our goal to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 in homes for 2014. We are also maintaining our backlog conversion ratio expectations, which is between 80% and 85% for both Q2 and Q3 and we expect to be over 90% for Q4. Next, our gross margin expectations are to still average 25% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being higher than the second and third quarter of this year. Our first quarter gross margin percentages were benefited by approximately 50 basis points due to the insurance settlement highlighted earlier. SG&A, we continued to focus on leveraging this line and expect about 25 basis points of potential improvements throughout the year, same as we said at year end. Financial Services earnings are still expected to be in the $65 million to $75 million range for the full year and it’s more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Rialto still expects profits between $30 million and 40 million for the year and those profits are also more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Multifamily still expects start-up losses of $15 million to $20 million for the year and this includes one or two apartment community sales that are possible later this year. Our joint venture and land sale category, we do not expect any significant sales for the remainder of the year, so we expect to be about breakeven for these two categories. And our 2014 effective tax rate is now expected to be about 37%. Net community count for the year, we still expect to end the year in a range of 600 to 625, even though we had a delay of about 16 communities into our second quarter. So with that, let me turn it over to the operator for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Good morning and very happy birthday wishes to Eric. Big picture, Stuart, you have a very solid quarter and you talked about the sequential improvement in pricing. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and any change in your view of builders increasing incentives as they are not seeing sales pace and how it impacts your business? And then just on the bigger picture basis, you had highlighted that your current operating divisions, I think you had said are roughly 30 and the comparison, I think was over a 100 at the peak. How do you operate as you grow with such a lean infrastructure? And is there opportunity to improve SG&A significantly better than where you are today?
Stuart Miller: Ivy, I’m going to let Rick and then, Jon lay in on those two questions.
Rick Beckwitt: From a competitive standpoint, Ivy, the market has ceded up a little bit, partially driven by the fact that there were some weather issues and builders were trying to move inventory close to the end of their quarters, depending on where their quarters were. We’re benefiting from the fact that there is not a lot of inventory out there for sale. So the issues aren’t that pronounced at this point. We did not increase significantly any incentives throughout the quarter as you can see in our numbers, although there are some folks out there that are pushing the number in order to move some inventory. But we’re not alarmed by that. We think that our communities are really well located or in decent places. We’ve got a good mix of build jobs as well as things moving through the construction cycle. So, we are really pleased with where we have inventory and how things are priced. We have seen a little bit of slowdown in price increases as we’ve moved through the year. Prices ran real quick. And so to the extent that there are incentives, it’s sort of balanced between maybe not moving the price up as much as taking something away. Jon, your thoughts?
Jon Jaffe: I would echo what Rick said. There are some isolated cases where competitive incentives are kicked in and particularly if you look at Phoenix or Las Vegas, but we’re well positioned. And we’re focused on really margin over maintaining a pace where there might be those incentives. In the most part, the west has been relatively light in incentives because it’s so land constrained. If you look at the west, it hovers around 3% as compared to the company average of just over 6%. And we feel that we’re very well positioned as we move forward with our community locations, product type. And as well, I would add our EI platform gives us a differentiation that allows us to, I think hold our prices more stable. With respect to the growth in leveraging our -- the way we structured our divisions, I think we learned a lot during the downturn and are very well positioned to be able to leverage that and continue to grow our community count with adding very little in the way of division management. We’ll clearly add out in the field in construction and sales as we add community count. But we see the need to add very little in terms of additional operational groups to be able to grow year-over-year effectively.
Rick Beckwitt: Yeah. And just to add to that, Ivy, from an organizational standpoint, keep in mind, we at the peak of the market were running this thing with nine regions. We’ve got four today. We had 100 plus operating divisions. And while we’re at 30, as some of the markets get a little bit bigger, let’s just use South Florida. We’re probably going to split South Florida into two pieces because it’s gotten so large. But given the fact that we’ve structured this pretty efficiently with product strategy and where things are getting purchased from a regional standpoint. We think we can keep the overhead real well in control and get some operating leverage.
Stuart Miller: And let me add one more point here. And that is, as we went through the downturn, we consolidated divisions in a number of ways. We combined some geographies. Some of those geographies will be unbound, but we were also running two platforms in almost every market. We were running an Everything’s Included in a designed studio platform across the country. And it was really a pretty inefficient way of running, but hard to unwind while the market was ceded. The downturn in the market really enabled us to unify under a single platform. We today have a well crafted EI program that has adapted to each local market. Rick and Jon work together and across our platform to really carefully craft the strategy as a one division market strategy for each unique geography and that marketing platform is very efficient today. So, while there will be some unwinding of some of the geographic doubling up, it will be minor in comparison to the efficiencies that we’ve created by operating under a singular platform that’s really carefully crafted for each market.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Thanks. Good morning. Stuart, I know historically you’ve said credit is loosening, but maybe very, very slowly. And it will take some time before we look back and look back a couple of years and see that action. Seems to me the biggest hurdle is regulatory certainty, so maybe what or maybe some specific, what are you doing and maybe a little bit more about what the industry doing is, maybe to get a thought of Mel Watt? Or for whoever else, potentially gets some more regulatory certainty in the market, maybe not such big things as GSE reform, but maybe some other things on the margin that the industry could potentially do to get things moved on a little more quickly? I would love your thoughts on that.
Stuart Miller: Well, it’s a good question. And let me say first of all that the industry is not just working on and getting in front of Mel Watt, but all of the participants in the discussion both in Congress and the Administration and making sure that we are heard and that the pitfalls of rapid change is not carefully thought out that doesn’t properly regard the plumbing system that’s in place should be of great concern. So when I say the industry, I mean, I’m included in that, but most of the CEOs are working together within the industry to make sure that the industry’s voices heard. So what are we doing other than trying to make sure that our voices are heard? I think a lot of the same things that investors and analysts and others are doing and that is we’re going to have to wait and see what actually does shake out. I know that we’ve seen some initial readings from the Senate, I guess Finance Committee or Banking Committee that has already approved GSE reform in a sense, but it’s a long way until those reforms are adopted by both houses of Congress and actually move forward. A lot of people think that there might not be much movement this year and maybe not for a couple of years. We will have to wait and see. What we have seen though in the field is that the margins credit has been reverting to more normalized levels in the very slow kind of orderly fashion. I will say that mortgage approval and tight money is a constraint to opening up demand and bringing demand to the marketplace, but at the margins and over time, I think we are seeing that reversion to normal. So you kind of have to sit back and rely on the fact that let the Administration and Congress understand how vital housing is to economic recovery and rely on the fact they probably won’t do something that materially alters the landscape and we will continue to see that reversion to normal as we go forward. That’s kind of how we’re thinking about it and incorporating that thinking into our business strategy.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. Just curious about how you view your ability in terms of one of the only companies to grow substantially in the last -- how you’re able to do that? And then quickly just curious about the South Florida decline there, maybe that just community count driven but was curious on that? Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. On California, Jon, why don’t you weigh in and Rick why don’t you take these?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. Hi, Eli. In California and West, in general, we’ve got out early and aggressive as we talked about on prior calls with our land acquisition strategy and positioned our ourselves for strong community count growth year-over-year, ‘13 over ‘12, ‘14 over ‘13. And what we said today, we are well positioned into ‘15, ‘16 and even into 2017. So it’s really been that strategy of getting out in all the primary markets in California, acquiring some flagship communities to have a stable presence in a lot of the markets as and then adding on to that and position ourselves for significant kind of growth that you’ve seen. So enable us to increase our sales activity 45% in the west and sales price up 37% and that’s on that community count growth of 47%. And we see that growth, I’m not saying at the high level community count but significant as we move forward.
Rick Beckwitt: And with regard to Southeast Florida, that’s really been a conscious effort on our part. We did not want sales to get ahead of us. This is a very strong market here. We’ve been very focused on pricing. We saw during the quarter we were up about 9% in South Florida on pricing. A little bit of it had an impact with regard to the timing of some grand openings that we had last year, particularly in the Doral area, but we are very comfortable with the strategy that we’re executing here. It’s tough, the market that has perhaps the highest margins that we have in the country. We’ve got great land assets and we want to make sure we don’t build through them too quick and building up backlog if we can’t deliver them doesn’t make a lot of sense for us, so we slowed it down.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Go ahead, your line is open.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: First question I had was on sales pace. And I think in the press release, it was noted that still maybe a little bit too early to call the spring, but at the same time, obviously, we’re about a month and half in February, obviously contributed to a solid quarter and you have an early look on March. With the comments also about sales pace, I guess, improving sequentially throughout the quarter, I was curious if you could give us a sense of, on a year-over-year basis sales pace was down roughly 4% versus the year ago quarter, if that was different at all intra-quarter? And as you’d kind of with the momentum I guess, or of at least February and into March, if there is any additional comments you might want to provide about your comfort level or confidence about the next couple months?
Stuart Miller: Yes. So Mike, we haven’t gone through the monthly absorption rate. What we did highlight is that we did progress favorably through the quarter. We were pleased as we got into February, but we didn’t get to the specific absorption rates month by month, but we are optimistic with what we are seeing with traffic, traffic improved throughout the quarter as well. Again, that’s a drill down into the numbers exactly. We felt like this is a normal progression through our first quarter going into the spring. We haven’t commented on March. We typically don’t do the intra-quarter commentary, but this is a normal progression that we would expect going into the spring selling season and wait and see what happens for the next three months.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Okay. Appreciate that. I mean, I guess, the second question just on gross margins, not to nitpick too much, but just so, I have -- more than just that I understand correctly your comments earlier Bruce about fourth quarter, you expect fourth quarter gross margins to be better than I believe say 2Q and 3Q. Obviously with the first quarter coming in around 25%, it might imply 2Q or 3Q being a little bit less than that. I just want to know if I’m interpreting that correct. And I know you haven’t really talked about margins beyond this year, but given the high level of margins relative to history, at the same time you have a great backlog of land that might create some above average visibility or sustainability of those margins. How you guys are thinking about margins past 2014?
Bruce Gross: Okay. So let me start with the first part of that question. In the first quarter, just a reminder, we had the benefits from the legal settlement. So excluding that, we’re at 24.6%. We expect Q2 and Q3 to be a little bit higher and therefore, it would likely be below the 25.1%, if you included the legal settlement and then the fourth quarter would likely be higher. So look at the 25% without the legal settlement included. And then for the second part of the question, we haven’t given any guidance to next year yet, but we do feel really good about the land. As Stuart said earlier, we do have locked and loaded the land for this year, next year. We feel very comfortable with the efficiencies we have in the business. So there is no reason to think that there is a going to be a falloff in the margins at this point. We will continue to update as we go through the year, but we are very encouraged and enthusiastic, as we think ahead into next year.
Stuart Miller: Just to add to that, let me say, as we look ahead to 2015 and ‘16, Mike, we’ve articulated in prior conference calls that we are thinking about volumes. Remember that this recovery has been somewhat different than prior recovery in that it is -- we’ve led this recovery with price increase recovery as opposed to volume recovery. But as we go forward, we suspect that we are going to see volumes increase and it’s altogether possible, but as volumes increase, we will add shorter term, more retail-oriented positions to our land portfolio. And as we do that that could alter the landscape of margins going forward, that is gross margins in favor of operating margins as we leverage our platform. So we are not going to look too far ahead. Right now, we have a great deal of confidence in our margin composition and where we are going in ‘14 and into ‘15, but that can -- the complexion of that can change and be altered a little bit if we decide to pick up volume by adding some community count. So we don’t really want to give a firm projection, but do want to highlight that we have excellent land positions to carry us into next year.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Great there, much appreciated.
Stuart Miller: Sure.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen East with ISI Group. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Stuart, you all gave us a lot of good information on multifamily, Rialto, et cetera? And we should be able to start to unlock value a little bit more from a modeling perspective? As you sit and look at those businesses and the timelines for monetization, you talked a little bit about potentially selling one or two apartments, but as you all think internally, how do you start to unlock the value from a monetization standpoint and when do you think that starts to occur?
Stuart Miller: Well, as I noted, Steve, these businesses are maturing and maturing right on track. When you look at the apartment business, you’re really starting to see a business that is defining the kind of a recurring program though we’re not quite there yet. Right now, we have two communities that are completed, two communities that are partially completed and 11 that are under construction. As we look ahead, we’re pretty confident that we’ll start construction on another seven or so this year and maybe even more. As we start to develop kind of a monthly tracking mechanism and a way of thinking about how long it’s going to take to actually put something online, take it offline and monetize. That’s when we’re going to start to be able to bring visibility to you as the business matures. And more importantly, start to think about what kind of monetization program might be most efficient in creating shareholder value. Likewise, Rialto is starting to present itself in a more normalized way. We highlighted three business segments, it’s actually really two. The first business segment is the liquidation of our legacy assets. The other two businesses are really starting to perk up and present. The asset management business is really fortifying itself with assets invested that are starting to generate real returns and perhaps, more importantly, promote that is not realized and as that starts to get realized, the maturity of that business will present itself alongside of our math, which is our make loans and securitize business, which is basically a fee business based on volume. So over the next year or two we’ll really start to see some visibility come out of those businesses and that visibility will be a stepping stone to getting to some form of monetization.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. Thank you. And then, just going back to the core business, just sort of looking at it, as you talked about this year, you’ve highlighted to some degree that you’ve got a little bit of SG&A leverage, but when I listened to Rick and Jon, it sounds like the potential for the SG&A leverage could jump up quite a bit, if you can get the volumes through the 15% type growth on communities? Just where, do you all think about your business, are you basically there on SG&A leverage or is this a story with some multiyear and we can expect to drive to levels that maybe lower levels that we didn’t see in prior cycles?
Rick Beckwitt: Steve, its Rick. I don’t think we’re there quite yet, but it’s coming pretty fast. We were a little bit delaying on the quarter because we had some weather impacts. New community openings, as Bruce highlighted, starts were a little bit impacted by 100 to 150 starts over the quarter. So it’s going to queue up as we move through the year. But as we said earlier, with regard to the restructuring that was done in the business and our focus on moving towards incremental volume and absorptions in these communities, we think that you’ll see the leverage. When it comes through it’s, probably, you are not going to see it, you will see sequential improvement as you’ve seen in prior years, but just give us a little bit of time and you will reach the benefit from that.
Stuart Miller: Let me just add to that for a second and say that, operating leverage is going to come in a couple of forms, but not just the efficiencies that you’ve already seen but the efficiencies that we continue to be focused on. We highlighted our digital platform in a small way in our opening remarks. The migration from conventional marketing and advertising to a more digital platform is something that we still think is in its infancy and our business and offers an opportunity to further enhance the operating leverage that we can have by bringing some new systems and programs to our regular platform. So, I think that, I think, we’re quickly getting to some of the efficiencies that are embedded in what we’ve done. But I think over the next few years, there is opportunity, not just for us, but for others in the industry to really enhance efficiencies by changing the way that we operate our business.
Stephen East - ISI Group: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Kim with Barclays. Go ahead. Your line is open.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: Great. Thanks a lot guys. Another strong quarter, congratulations on that. I wanted to just start off just little bit comment, which I think, Mike, earlier was trying to get at, which is that he just made an observation that sort of things in the fourth quarter were a little bit softer in terms of the demand side and the progression now with, of course, the first quarter was kind of normal sequentially and so if that would be the -- what you described the implication might be that, if things are still a little bit not as good as maybe things had been in the past? So I just throw that out in terms of an observation there maybe something getting lost in translation, because I’m sort of hearing from your body language the things are good but not great, they’re certainly not bad, you used the word optimistic which can mean a lot of different things? But my question actually relates to the first time buyer. You and many other builders have sort of talked about the fact that there is sort of some difficulties in that market, I know you’ve talked about it in the past, it’s sort of not yet fully come into its own yet? And I was curious as to when you think that market, that buyer type might start coming back into the market in greater format and what you’re doing to prepare for it? And I’m specifically interested in the timing of it and what you’re doing in terms of like the land and things like that to particularly go after that market?
Rick Beckwitt: On the land side, Steve, its Rick. As we said in prior quarters when this question has been brought up, we’ve been focused on securing land positions that are right for this type of buyer. Price point needs to be low. Volumes need to be high, because you’re making a small amount per copy when you’re closing the home. So in order to be in this business, you need to structure as a volume-oriented business because it’s generally skinnier gross margins but rapid pace.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: Right.
Rick Beckwitt: Since we benefit from the fact as that we’ve secured the lion share of our deliveries for ‘14 and ‘15 gives us an opportunity to tap out there and tie-up some pieces of properties, so when this buyer comes out, we’re positioned for it and that’s exactly what we’ve done.
Stuart Miller: I would just add to what, Rick said that, we’re also working with the buyers that are first-time buyers and sitting down with them and helping them from a credit counseling perspective. So that we’re helping them to prepare to be able to qualify for a mortgage as that first time market comes back.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: So I just want to make sure that I’m understanding what I heard. So is this your view Rick that your company because of the fact that you’ve been sort of proactive in this and have identified this market as one that’s going to come back, did you already take in steps maybe perhaps more than your competition to position yourself to capture this market when the buyer demand increases there or is this not a strategic focus for you versus your competitors? I’m just trying to understand how important…
Bruce Gross: I’m not going to talk about what the competition is doing because I don’t think that’s particularly relevant to what our investor base is interested in. What I will tell you is that we have made conscious effort to address this as a potential augmented business as the market recovers. Right now, the financing is a little bit tough. There is down payment issues with this type of buyer. But given the demographics and what we know about the market, this market is going to come back. I think that’s why Stuart foreshadowed earlier in the call that our margins maybe impacted a bit as we pursue a more volume-oriented approach as we capture and expand the business. So we are very focused on it.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: Got it.
Bruce Gross: It’s something that will come, but there has got to be a conscious effort to both tie up the land, build a program and run a business that’s a little bit different than the core business.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: Okay. Got it. Great, that’s actually very clear. Thanks very much for that. The second question I had related to your just another sort of a buyer type, it’s the foreign buyer. I know this isn’t a huge deal for you guys, but in certain of your communities, particularly on the West Coast and in essence, South Florida, it’s kind of like hard to not notice that there is an awful lot of concentration for a particular type of buyer that’s not really making it home, their homes here in the U.S. traditionally, but they are buying property here in the U.S. And I was curious as to whether you could just sort of comment on how are you targeting that buyer? Are you just sort of creating communities based on what has sold and this buyer is just sort of coming forward or you have to be specifically marketing to a foreign buyer. And then, maybe as sort of a follow on to that is the -- is there any change given the exchange rate because the Chinese yen had weakened pretty considerably against the dollar recently. Have you seen anything on the West Coast? I guess it’s a question for Jon.
Stuart Miller: Yeah, Jon, why don’t you go ahead and take all of that?
Jon Jaffe: Sure. We’re definitely seeing more demand from the Chinese buyer and offshore buyer. But you have to really break it down into its bucket, Steve. It’s -- you have those that are U.S. residents and then you have foreign nationals. And I’d say that the mix has changed over last year, what we’re currently seeing. You probably have a little bit more weighting towards the foreign national buyer that’s coming in, either all cash or 50% down. We really haven’t seen any change in the demand from that buyer because of currency activity. It’s stayed pretty healthy and you tend to see it in certain markets. So at San Francisco, in Irvine, L.A., are very strong markets for that buyer profile. And we do selective marketing to that buyer profile for those markets, but we don’t do it for the markets that aren’t as popular for that profile.
Stephen Kim - Barclays: Great. That’s really helpful. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead your line is open.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets: Hi. This is actually Desi filling in for Bob. You talked about labor and material costs rising by nearly 10% in the quarter. You also mentioned that you’ve seen less pressure on the labor side. So do you expect to continue seeing maybe some relief on labor cost as volumes recover and contractors come back to the market or is that a temporary development?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. I think that we’re seeing as the recovery matures, the labor force is getting more and more comfortable with hiring and acquiring equipment. So the labor force we feel is catching up. I wouldn’t say it’s caught up yet but we’re not seeing as much pressure as we saw before and that’s why we described that’s been easing. We will still overall costs go up. As Stuart mentioned, certain material categories are going up. Lumber has gone up slightly in the fourth quarter and first quarter. We’d expect lumber to go up a little bit more in the second quarter. So I think you’ll see a moderation of the year-over-year cost increase but think it’d probably be sequentially based on what’s already in our system, 3% to 4% higher in our Q2 deliveries over Q1. I mean, that’s slowly coming down sequentially and year-over-year.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets: Great. Thanks. And then getting back to the topic of pursuing land deals with maybe slightly lower gross margins but minimal SG&A outlays. Are these projects you’ve already started to pursue or is that something you would start to do once the market reaches higher volumes?
Rick Beckwitt: This is Rick. This is something that we’ve already started pursuing and that I think are starting against now.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Go ahead, your line is open.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you provide any color on how land prices have moved over the last quarter and year-to-date. I noticed you picked up your pace of acquisition and I want to see if you could comment on that.
Rick Beckwitt: So on the land acquisition side, keep in mind that a fair amount is what we have purchased during the quarter was put under contract several quarters ago and maybe even years ago. So it’s just the timing as it moves through the snake. From a pricing standpoint, prices have moved up a bit, in some markets they have been flat. It really depends on the flow of activity in the individual markets. We’re pretty comfortable with where the market is right now. And as we’ve said in prior calls, we benefit from the fact that we’re not primarily looking for immediate delivery type of things. Jon, any flavor from your side?
Jon Jaffe: Yeah, it’s very market specific. So if you look at Phoenix, it definitely has flattened in that kind of market. But in Coastal California, it continues to be very heated and increases. But as Rick said, we are really well positioned with what we need for next couple of years. So, we tend to be looking at either the short-term, quicker turns or more of an entitlement play where we can patrol land for the future and still have healthy margins.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Great. I appreciate the color. Just on the Financial Services side, I think you noted in the opening remarks about the retail strategy. You mentioned that could supplement volumes. Can you discuss that in further detail and what that actually entails?
Stuart Miller: Sure, Jade. Right now in total, we have over 90% of our origination or purchase originations. But we have a retail platform called Eagle Mortgage and it was heavily focused geographically on the West part of the country. We are looking to open branches and expand that from the West Coast of the country across to the East Coast and expand that platform. So focusing primarily on purchase business, but leveraging our back office and our systems to get more operating leverage on that platform. So this will be a slow methodical growth program over the next several years.
Jade Rahmani - KBW: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Stuart Miller: Okay. And why don’t we take one last question.
Operator: Our last question is from David Goldberg with UBS. Goldberg, go ahead. Your line is open.
David Goldberg - UBS: Yes. Thanks for taking my call. Very good afternoon.
Stuart Miller: Hi, David.
David Goldberg - UBS: My first question was on -- actually, I wanted to ask a follow-up to a question Eli had asked earlier and Stuart mentioned. It seem some loosening starting to come through that’s really the first we’ve kind of been hearing from builders with some of the bank efforts to loosen, are starting to show up in actual builder result. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on, what is it, is it procedural loosening, is it credit loosening, is it loosening in terms of standards? Can you just give us some increased color on what you meant by the comments and where you have seen it?
Stuart Miller: Actually, I think we’ve been hearing it from most of the builders over the past quarters and the loosening has been a gradual, very gradual acceptance by the banks that the standards articulated by the GSEs and FHA, VA, are not going to give rise to put backs. And where they feel comfortable that there are not going to put backs, they have been loosening up some of the overlays that have been in place for some period of time. Some of this is derived from the just the practical application of the evaporation of the refi market. As the refi business has dissipated, the banks have started to expand their desire to lend this to more primary purchasers as they try to fill the void, that’s been left behind by the refi market. And we’ve seen that over the past year. Bruce, maybe you would like to weigh in on?
Bruce Gross: Sure. And additionally things like the mortgage insurance market coming back, we now have close to 40% of our conventional loan that’s getting mortgage insurance. So they’re putting down 20% of the tune of that 40%. So all of these things are small steps, but we are seeing it directionally heading in the right direction. I don’t think you’re going to necessarily see a fixed spike up, but all these things are helping on the margins. We have seen some of the overlays, as Stuart said, have eliminated. We are seeing some of the people coming out of the short sale and foreclosure time expiration period. So the trend is positive with a lot of small steps.
Stuart Miller: And I think we’ve also heard some of the banks articulate that they’re going to rethink the subprime market and start looking at the other avenues through opening up lending channels.
Bruce Gross: Right. They’re going to look to replace that revenue. They lost the refinance volume like everybody else and they were looking to replace that. And they’re eliminating the overlays that were put in place both with FICO scores coming down as well as some of the conditions to be able to get loans.
David Goldberg - UBS: That color is really helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up, with the move-in to the retail, some more retail operations on the mortgage, on the finance side, can you talk about the regulatory scrutiny you are facing? We have heard from a lot of lenders that they’ve been facing increased regulatory scrutiny including from the CFPB. Can you talk about costs in the business and if you think being in the retail side increasingly would open you up to more scrutiny as a mortgage originator? Thanks so much.
Stuart Miller: Sure. As you know, on the regulatory side, the increased costs, we had already put those in place over the last year or so with respect to more quality control. So that’s been embedded in our program. We haven’t seen additional scrutiny. We follow the right procedures. I think some of the scrutiny you might be referring to has also been on the servicing side with some companies that have bought large servicing portfolios. But our program is a methodical program following the same procedures we do on the purchase side. So, we’re not expecting to be in a position that there’s going to be scrutiny on the retail side. We have a great group of associates with Eagle Mortgage. We are looking to leverage which worked well for many years for us. So, we’re not expecting any issues there.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thanks so much. I appreciate the color.
Stuart Miller: Very good. Well, that wraps it up for today. Very happy to report our results for the first quarter and look forward to circling back and reporting on our progress throughout the year. Thank you for joining us and we will speak soon. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like now to introduce your conference host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter and year end 2013 update. We're very pleased to share our results with you this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you've just heard from, who's our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here as well for our question-and-answer session. And Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is with us by telephone from California. I'd like to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the overall state of the housing market and then briefly overview our operations. Bruce, as usual, will provide further detail on our overall numbers and some further comments on our Financial Services segment. And then we'll open up to question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] So let me begin. Over the past months, we've seen a pause in the rate of improvement in the recovery of the housing market as both volume and price appreciation have moderated in response to political turmoil and interest rate increases. We noted in our third quarter conference call that we were beginning to see signs of this moderation, but we believed then, and we continue to believe now, that the housing market remains on track for a solid recovery and is likely to continue to improve over an extended period of time. We continue to believe that the overriding driver of recovery in the housing market remains the production deficit of both single- and multi-family dwellings throughout the economic downturn and up to and including this year. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the builders of both multi- and single-family products will need to increase production, as inventories have remained extremely low and pent-up demand comes on to the market. And even as the market responds, inventories are likely to remain constrained, as production increases are limited by a shortage of entitled and developed land to build on in desirable locations. While we recognize the potential headwinds from recent moves to lower loan limits and raised guarantee fees on government-sponsored mortgages and the continued pressure on interest rates, we feel that the short supply of available homes and pent-up demand, along with a generally improving economy, will continue to drive the housing recovery forward. And we're anticipating a robust spring selling season, which historically begins just after the Super Bowl. Our view, and the primary driver of our business strategy, is that the housing recovery is still very much intact and that the fundamentals of that recovery remain solid. Currently, we are seeing, in the field, traffic patterns that indicate that buyers are coming to the market and finding short supplies. While this time of the year is our seasonal slow -- seasonally slow time of year for actually closing sales, we are continuing to see healthy interest in the field, which indicates that the 2014 selling season will prove to be very healthy for those who are well positioned with well-located assets and product. Against that backdrop, Lennar has finished up 2013 with a very solid fourth quarter and full year results that speak both to the solid management and execution of our articulated strategies and to the positioning of our company for performance in the future. Each of our businesses showed strong results for 2013, and we are well positioned for the future. As a company, we took advantage of the market cycle and, accordingly, we feel we have excellent asset positions to drive future growth. Homebuilding, of course, remains our primary driver of quarterly performance. For the fourth quarter, revenues grew to $1.9 billion, up 42% over last year, as we continued to focus on maximizing our pricing power. Our sales pace in the fourth quarter averaged 2.9 sales per community per month, which was flat or just short of last year at 3 per month. Our average sales price advanced to $307,000, which was a year-over-year increase of $46,000 or 18% and a 5.5% sequential increase from the third quarter. This improvement in sales prices covered increases in labor and material and the cost -- and land costs, as reflected in our gross margin. The fourth quarter gross margin improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 26.8%, a 330-basis-point improvement, reflecting the strength of our well-positioned communities. With SG&A of 9.9%, a 140-basis-point year-over-year improvement, we continue to improve our operating leverage. An example of this focus is in our advertising spend, where, for the full year, we increased new orders 21% over 2012, but we spent less in nominal dollars than we did in 2012. This operating leverage produced a 16.9% net operating margin for the quarter, which was a 490-basis-point improvement and close to peak quarterly operating margins. In our fourth quarter, new orders were up 13% over last year, while our new order dollar value of $1.4 billion was up 34% over the prior year, and our dollar value of backlog is up over 40%. We opened 77 new communities and closed out 54 communities during the quarter to end at 3 -- 537 active communities, a 17% year-over-year increase. As expected, our backlog conversion ratio was 95% for the fourth quarter, and we expect Q1 to be between 80% and 85%. Our fourth quarter performance highlights strong management execution but also indicates how well we are positioned for future performance. During the fourth quarter, we continued our carefully crafted land acquisition program and purchased approximately 11,000 homesites for $365 million, while we spent $197 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 76% over the prior year period. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets where we saw the best opportunities. In addition, we signed contracts to acquire approximately 3,000 homesites. As we look ahead to 2014 and beyond, we feel fortunate to have the land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014 and well into 2015, and this positions us well to maintain gross margins that are consistent with our reported full year 2013 25% growth. While recent sales have seen mild increases in the use of incentives on selected inventory, we expect that margins will continue to remain steady. Over the past quarters, we've augmented our land strategy with the addition of shorter-turn, quicker -- shorter-term, quicker-turn purchases with high IRRs in order to continue to leverage our existing operating platform in 2014 and 2015. These are excellent deals for the company, even if they are at lower gross margins, because we can increase our operating margin, given that we already have the divisional fixed overhead covered for the next 2 years. At November 30, 2013, we owned and controlled approximately 154,000 homesites. And, as I mentioned before, we had 537 active communities. In 2014, we expect to be able to increase community count by approximately 15% year-over-year. Overall, our homebuilding operations have improved and will continue to improve due to a strong operating strategy complemented by an excellent management team and management execution. Complementing our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had a very respectable quarter with operating earnings of $17 million, though down from the $33.2 million last year, when the refinancing business was booming. Our mortgage company captured some 75% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which we operate. While mortgage and title operations have benefited from a robust refinancing market in past quarters, that part of the business has now all but evaporated. Lennar home mortgage and title continue to grow, however, alongside our expanding Homebuilding business, as well as to serve a growing number of non-Lennar purchasers in a growing number of markets across the country. While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating divisions are all continuing to mature as excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Rialto has continued to grow as a blue chip capital investment management company and commercial real estate capital provider. While past quarter earnings slowed as we have shifted from a balance sheet investment company to a fund investment model, the current quarter results for Rialto demonstrate prospects for future consistent earnings. Almost 2/3 of the almost $14 million pretax contribution from Rialto this quarter is a direct result of our new mortgage loan origination business. As we mentioned last quarter, earlier this year, we brought on board one of the industry's most experienced commercial real estate loan origination teams. The initial objective for Rialto Mortgage Finance has been to originate and securitize long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized cash-flowing, institutional-grade commercial real estate properties. By quarter end, we had successfully originated approximately $700 million of mortgage loans and completed 4 securitizations, generating over $23 million of gross profit. This business has also been a perfect fit with our existing Rialto franchise, which already has been the market leader in CMBS B-piece investing and special servicing. In addition, now that the business is ramping up, we expect it will begin to generate more predictable and -- a more predictable and recurring component of earnings for Rialto and also begin generating excellent opportunities for our other investment vehicles and for us. The rest of this quarter's contribution is from our previously existing real estate investment business. Our first real estate fund, in which we invested approximately $1 billion of private equity, including $75 million from us, continues to perform well above expectations. With next week's distribution, our investors will already have received back $420 million, representing 60% of their original equity commitments, in less than a year since we closed our final investment in the fund. Our second real estate fund is also well on its way, finishing out its $1.3 billion equity raise this week. We far exceeded our $950 million fundraising goal, and Fund 2 has already invested or committed to invest approximately $600 million in 40 transactions. We are also continuing to raise our first mezzanine fund that is focused on investments in real estate loans that fall below -- just below the Fund 2 return threshold. We've already raised and invested a little less than 1/3 of our targeted $300 million of equity. In addition, we are now managing a $200 million separate account for a major insurance company. At this point in time, while we currently are paid fees and are reimbursed certain costs by our investors from these vehicles, our financial statements do not reflect any carried interest, as we don't recognize this component of income until it becomes due and payable. Looking forward, we continue to see compelling opportunities in our core areas of expertise, including the continued clearing of distressed and sub-performing assets from financial institutions, providing the vital capital and management to reposition and refinance real estate assets as the markets continue to expand, and the growth of commercial real estate finance, where we've been a market leader in new B-piece investing and special servicing and, now, new loan origination and securitization. As with Rialto, we are pleased with the progress of our multi-family apartment business. This business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to be one of the leading developers of new Class A apartments in the United States. We've assembled a seasoned team of professionals across the country that is leveraging every aspect of our company. In the fourth quarter, we commenced construction on 5 new apartment communities and now have 11 active communities and 1 completed community, totaling approximately 3,250 apartments with an estimated development cost of some $590 million. In addition to these communities, we have a geographically diversified development pipeline that exceeds $3 billion and represents over 12,500 additional rental apartments. As we've discussed in the past, we're building these apartments with third-party institutional capital, and each deal has been conservatively financed with nonrecourse debt. In addition, we've underwritten our investment using today's rents and unlevered yield on cost that are 125 to 200 basis points over prevailing cap rates. With our conservative financing and underwriting, we're positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than 2x. We anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next 4 years. And as a merchant builder of apartments, we plan to sell our apartments once rents and occupancies have stabilized. We should begin to see returns on invested capital by the middle of 2014 with a more meaningful contribution from our Multifamily segment in fiscal 2015. Finally, our FivePoint Communities continues to mature as a long-term strategy as well and is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium California locations to market to fill the growing demand for well-located approved and developed homesites. In our second quarter, we saw our first earnings contribution from this division. We believe that FivePoint will create excellent long-term shareholder value for the company. In conclusion, let me say that, while we are aware of the concerns that are being reflected in current market volatility, our company strategy continues to be driven by our belief that the market remains positioned to continue to recover and that our company is very well positioned to benefit. The housing market is healing, and we believe that the recovery is driven by shortage of available inventory, by pent-up demand and limited land available for building. While political and interest rate headwinds have tended to slow the recovery for the short term, our traffic patterns indicate to us that a generally improving economy will drive improved household formation and increased demand as we enter the 2014 selling season. Lennar's homebuilding operation and asset base is extremely well positioned for the year ahead. We have excellent land positions in all of our major markets, while the overall land market is very constrained, and we have continued to fortify that position. Our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations will continue to be the company's primary driver of current earnings. Our ancillary businesses of Rialto, Lennar Multifamily communities and FivePoint continue to mature and expand their franchises and will provide excellent longer-term opportunities to enhance shareholder value. We are very pleased with our progress and performance in 2013 and look forward to a very successful year ahead. Thank you, and let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. I'll add some color to the numbers that were in the press release today, starting with Homebuilding. Our results reflected strong top line growth as our revenues from home sales increased 50% in the fourth quarter, driven by a 27% increase in deliveries and an 18% increase year-over-year in average sales price to $307,000. Let me give you some more details of that average sales price by region: the East region was $274,000, up 12%; Southeast Florida was up 13% to $299,000; Central region, $270,000, that was up 17%; Houston, $277,000, up 15%; the West region was up 31% to $407,000; and Other was $382,000, up 9%. The gross margin on home sales that Stuart talked about, up 330 basis points to 26.8%, was driven by a couple of things. Primarily, sales incentives were $20,600 per home in the quarter, and that was an improvement of 270 basis points. It came down from 9% in the prior year to 6.3% in the current quarter. The gross margin percent improved in every one of our regions during the quarter and was highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. Our new communities purchased since 2009 continued their margin outperformance and represented approximately 2/3 of the company's deliveries in the fourth quarter. The strong gross margin performance was partially offset by a 12% increase in labor and material cost to just under $47 per square foot. Sequentially, this is about a 3% increase from the third quarter. Labor costs were up a little bit more than material costs during the quarter. And we did benefit from the lower lumber cost earlier in the year that started to benefit our closings in the current quarter. We do expect that there will be continued cost pressure in 2014 as the supply chain works to catch up to increased production levels. In addition to the significant operating margin leverage that Stuart commented on, we have additionally recognized operating leverage in our corporate G&A line, as our corporate G&A improved 60 basis points to 2.3% of total revenues, and that compared to 2.9% in the prior year. The other income net line totaled $13.3 million of profit during the quarter, and this was due to the sale of a rental operating property. This transaction resulted in a net loss of $3.2 million after including the reduction to the noncontrolling interest line of $17.6 million because this was a consolidating joint venture. This is not part of our new Multifamily operating segment. This building was repurposed from condo to rental use during the housing downturn, and the sale positively impacted the balance sheet by generating $53 million of cash and retiring $88 million of consolidated debt during the quarter. Turning to Financial Services. This segment generated operating earnings of $17 million versus $33.2 million in the prior year. Our mortgage pretax income decreased to $14.3 million from $30.9 million in the prior year. Mortgage originations declined approximately 9% from the prior year to $1.3 billion. As I have been highlighting for several quarters, we have been expecting the number of refinanced transactions to decline and the profit per transaction to moderate, and we did see that in our results this quarter. Refinanced loan origination volume declined about 80% from the prior year's quarter, and this has also resulted in margin compression as more competitors focused on the purchase business. Our mortgage operations have shifted to purchase business, with the mix now 93% purchase transactions and only 7% refinance transactions. Our title company also experienced a significant reduction in refinanced transactions but delivered a $3.4 million profit in the quarter, compared with $2.9 million of profit in the prior year. Turning to our Rialto segment. They generated operating earnings of $13.9 million, compared to $4.6 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of these earnings by type of investment is as follows: the investment management business, these are the funds that we manage, contributed $7.2 million of earnings; the direct investments, which are the FDIC and the bank portfolios, contributed a net of $9.2 million of earnings; and these amounts were reduced by $12.7 million of G&A and other, and that's net of management fees. Our new Rialto Mortgage Finance operations contributed a net $10.2 million during the first full quarter of operations. Rialto's balance sheet is well positioned, as we fully paid off the remainder of the $627 million of FDIC debt. And during the quarter, we issued $250 million of 7% senior notes due in 2018 in Rialto. The net proceeds were used primarily to originate loans in Rialto Mortgage Finance and repay $100 million of capital to Lennar for the monies that were advanced to start up Rialto Mortgage Finance. Turning to the Multifamily segment. This is a new segment that we separated this quarter as a result of the significant growth in the multi-family business. The initial results are the start-up expenses relating to the strong team that we've put in place that has already built the $3.7 billion pipeline that Stuart highlighted. Turning to our balance sheet, our liquidity and leverage both improved during the quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with $700 million of cash and 0 outstanding under our $950 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Our Homebuilding net debt-to-total cap declined sequentially from 53% to 45.6%, driven by strong earnings and the conversion of the entire $277 million of principal amount of 2% convertible senior notes. The shares from this convert were always included in our fully diluted EPS calculations, so there's no additional dilution that is suffered from this conversion. Stockholders' equity increased by $754 million during 2013 to end at $4.2 billion. Our book value per share increased to $20.39 per share. So now let's look forward to 2014. I'd like to summarize some of what's been said on this call and highlight a few additional goals for 2014. Number one, deliveries. We are currently geared up to deliver between 21,000 and 22,000 homes for 2014. I want to clarify the backlog conversion by quarter. We do expect a backlog conversion ratio between 75% and 80% for the first quarter, and then it jumps to 80% to 85% for the second and third quarters. And then, over 90% is expected for the fourth quarter. As Stuart mentioned, our gross margin is expected to average about 25% for the full year, and then there's going to be the normal seasonality applied between the quarters, which is lower at the beginning of the year and higher, typically, in the fourth quarter at the end of the year. SG&A expenses. We do believe that there's an opportunity to continue to increase the operating leverage that we've been seeing, and we expect up to another 25 basis points of potential improvement in 2014. Our Financial Services operations are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million for the year. We have very tough comparisons in the first half of the year, due to the loss of the refinanced business that I discussed. We expect the first quarter, which is typically the slowest quarter for Financial Services, to be under $5 million of profit for that quarter. Turning to Rialto, we expect a range of profits between $30 million and $40 million for the year, with the first quarter close to breakeven and then picking up and having more consistent earnings for the rest of the year. The Multifamily segment, we expect, will be another start-up year. We might sell a building or 2 later in the year, with the bottom line expected to be between a range of $15 million and $20 million of additional net start-up loss, while we're positioning for a much stronger 2015. On the joint venture line, some of you might have heard recently, we had a press release about the El Toro community. We received entitlements for the 9,500 homes at the El Toro Great Park Neighborhoods, and during this process, we held off on incorporating the expected development changes until those entitlements were finalized. As a result, we're not expecting any large land sales to third-party builders until our first quarter of 2015. However, Great Park has been a tremendous success. It's approximately 30% sold out already, and we're experiencing rising sales prices. So we continue to build tremendous value in the FivePoint assets. However, the joint venture profit line for the entire year is expected to be about breakeven. Our 2014 effective tax rate is expected to be about 37.75% for all of 2014. And then the net community count, as was highlighted, is expected to increase about 15% from our ending count of 537 to a range of 600 to 625 by the end of 2014. So with that, let me open it up for any of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Stuart, I'll just get it over with so you won't have to answer the question and over and over. Can you talk about the progression of the orders through the quarter, what you were seeing, trend-wise, anything post-quarter? I know it's not very long. And then also, could you just -- your West was much better than we expected; and Southeast Florida, worse than expected on orders. Just maybe a little guidance on that, what was going on?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes, let me turn that over to Rick and to Jon, Steve. Rick, go ahead.
Richard Beckwitt: So Steve, from a quarter standpoint, we saw a sequential improvement during the quarter from September through November, pretty consistent month-to-month. That was consistent with regard to both number of homes sold, as well as pricing, ASP increases. So I think that, that -- we view that as a positive. As you know, it paused in sort of the late summer, and it was nice to see the improvement sequentially. As we look at -- just specifically with regard to Southeast Florida, we made some conscious decisions there to slow things down, so don't be alarmed with the decline in year-over-year new orders. The thing I would point out is we have an incredibly strong backlog there, up 50% year-over-year. And if you look at the price, ASP in Southeast Florida, you'll see that, that was dramatically up as well. So we made some conscious decision to slow things down. Jon, how about California?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Yes, Steve. In the West, we saw pretty consistent sales throughout the quarter, following the same sequential trend that Rick spoke about. But certainly, we were benefited by the grand opening at the Great Park, El Toro, generating a lot of sales there. We found Vegas was a strong market for us throughout the quarter, with good sales, and Northern California. And compared to some of the reports that you and others have put out, showing sort of declining sales in the West, we found our sales held up pretty strong and had very limited incentives that were needed to move inventory.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's very helpful. And then Stuart, if you look at -- you talked about being optimistic on the spring. What are you looking for? When will you start getting signs of what the spring is doing, and what type of milepost would you look for to either continue to ratchet up pricing or start to use incentives in a greater way?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, historically, the exact date that the spring starts to be indicated moves around a lot. And especially over the past years, that has been the case. We always peg Super Bowl. I mean, it seems a little bit irrational, but it seems that when the Super Bowl ends, people start getting out there and looking for homes. It's more towards wintertime than actual spring, but that's when we start to get our early indications as to what's coming. What makes us think about spring as a -- or early indication being that spring is going to be a pretty responsible season is the progression of sales. As we've watched the market adjust to the interest rate increases and to the political environment being in a pretty solid state of turmoil, we did see the market adjust. And it started with traffic, but as Rick indicated and Jon indicated, we did see sequential improvement as we went through the quarter. And that, together with our traffic patterns, gives us pretty good sense, right now, that the spring selling season is starting to shape up. I'm not going to say -- I'm not going to be too aggressive in my statement, but we feel that it's shaping up to be pretty strong, given the demographic trends that we know exist, the pent-up demand that we are pretty sure exists, and some of it just coming pent-up demand from the political turmoil that we've seen. We think it's going to reveal itself in the spring, and we feel like we're really well prepared for it.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC: It's actually Alan on for Ivy. Stuart, just on the spring and your comments there. And obviously, you said you expect to see some robust activity in the spring. I was curious what kind of the mix of that looks like between volume and price because a lot of other builders, and maybe you guys to a lesser extent this year, obviously, focused on price over volume. And I think that this quarter, we've seen a modest uptick in your incentives. And I'm curious, when you think about what a robust spring selling season means, is that double-digit volume growth for you, or is it some type of combination between pricing and volume? And if the volume doesn't materialize, at what point do you use price as a lever to drive additional sales?
Richard Beckwitt: Maybe I'll take that. This is Rick. It's going to be a combination. I think that we've seen and, as you've noted, in our numbers throughout the year, you've seen some pretty dramatic price increases. I think you'll start to see some of that normalize to maybe single-digit, low double-digit paces. And as Stuart mentioned early on, we are very focused on operating margin as opposed to just the pure gross margin line. So you'll see us play a little bit with pace to accentuate some communities where we can pick up some incremental absorption to push the bottom line.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC: That's really helpful. So just to kind of interpret that, then, you're confident that you could drive additional volume, even continuing to push price in that high single-digit or even low double-digit range in 2014?
Stuart A. Miller: Generally speaking, we're -- it remains our view that inventories are pretty tight out there, both on the existing and the new home front. And with rental rates having continued to climb, we feel that, as the season starts to present itself, we feel it's more likely that we're going to be able to both see volume increases and be able to manage the higher ASP.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Great. And then, just one additional one. On the gross margin guidance for flat margin guidance next year, obviously, this quarter came in above your expectations that you laid forth last quarter. Curious, what portion of that conservatism is a function of more of those quicker-turn deals that you referenced earlier? Or is it truly just higher land cost, higher cost falling through that you expect to offset the benefit of the robust selling season?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, it's a combination. We have some of those shorter-term positions that are starting to -- that are flowing through. But let's not minimize the fact that, in what I have characterized as a somewhat squishy environment, given the higher interest rates, given the political environment, now, incrementally, as we start to look at what the FHFA announced yesterday with higher guarantee fees, lower loan limits, although that's a little bit varied across the geography, there are some areas that you have to look at and conservatize your outlook. And that's exactly what we did as we presented for the third quarter. We were interested in looking and watching at how the market evolved. Likewise, as we look ahead to 2015, remember, we're getting pretty close to peak margins, both at the gross line and at the net line. And so we want to take a responsible and conservative look at where we think we're going to be. We feel comfortable with a flat and attractive margin for 2014. And we think that the environment will enable us to maintain those high and responsible growth margins as we grow our business.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My first question relates to land spend. I noticed that the percentage of revenues that's your land spend declined pretty noticeably this quarter, which would -- particularly from what you'd been running at earlier this year. And I guess I was curious as to if you could comment on if there's anything that we should read into that about what you believe the trajectory, near-term trajectory of land prices is likely to be or if you've see the value of land actually decline, generalizing there across the country, since, let's say, the second quarter or so?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, Steve, remember, we got way out ahead of the rest of the pack. And we bought sizable parcels of land and land positions in all of our major markets early on. We really used the cycle in a very constructive way in positioning our company for the future. So as we look ahead, I've noted in my remarks that we have been adjusting our land strategy. We are focused on leveraging the good parcels that we've purchased. It necessitates buying somewhat less land as we go forward. Now, of course, growth will necessitate that we pick up that amount -- or the amount of the spend. But you are seeing somewhat of a trend. Our land spend is down a little bit right now, and if you look at the number of homesites that we've put under contract, I highlighted 3,000 homesites that were put under contract. We are moderating. As land prices have bumped up, we're in the enviable position of not having to push the market, and we're really carefully managing the land spend. And as the market matures, you can expect to see that we will be purchasing less in the way of longer-term positions, auctioning land more aggressively and also making sure that our land purchases, land that we put under contract, comes onto our books in more of a just-in-time fashion.
Richard Beckwitt: Steve, the other thing I'd point out is -- and you see it in the numbers that our land development spend increased. And that's a function of the fact that, when we were early-cycle in buying some of these pieces, we're now putting the money into the ground in order to maximize the value of these assets and build on it. So I think, as Stuart said, we're in a transition point right now.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. Absolutely. Okay. That's very helpful. The second question relates, I guess, more to a comment I thought I heard Bruce mention about operating leverage. And by that, I'm reading into that as sort of SG&A. And I think, Bruce, you made a comment that you still think that there's additional opportunities for overhead -- or rather, operating leverage. I think you said 25 basis points in 2014. Is that -- should I be thinking that, therefore, SG&A/corporate, as a percentage of homebuilding rev, might be down like 25 basis points, but probably not drastically more than that?
Bruce E. Gross: That's our expectation right now. We've gotten down to a point that is lower than we've been at for the last number of years. We do have some leverage, and I think 25 basis points is a good place to think about us as we look at next year. So I wouldn't go beyond that at this point.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question I had was on gross margins, just to go back to that, obviously a pretty important area in terms of modeling going forward, notwithstanding additional SG&A leverage. But with the guidance of roughly flat for the full year, and you also alluded to some seasonality, weaker in the -- lower in the first half, stronger in the back half. It would imply, if you're just kind of working off of 25% as an average, pretty sizable sequential decline from where you are right now relative to, let's say, at the end of '12 into early '13, it was more of like a 150-ish type sequential decline. And so just trying to get a sense if there's any conservatism there or any product mix shift or geographic mix that might be influencing those comments because, obviously, to end the year with an average of around 26% is pretty strong. And as you've alluded to, you still have a lot of high-quality land coming through the income statement.
Richard Beckwitt: Well, this is Rick. I think you've got to keep in mind that we are going into the seasonably lower period where we're going to get deliveries in our first quarter. Historically, our gross margin in Q1 has been 100 to 200, 300 basis points, depending on the year, lower than what our Q4 has been. You've got costs associated with winter starts and deliveries. So it's consistent with where we were last year. Keep in mind, last year, in Q1, I think we were at 22.1% gross. So guiding towards -- we're still, on a year-over-year basis, much higher than where we were last year. I guess the other thing I'd point out is, when you look at gross margins, we are so far ahead of where the rest of the pack is out there that at 25% growth, it's pretty strong.
Bruce E. Gross: And I would just add, Mike, when you think about the first quarter gross margins with that lower volume, all of our field expenses for all the construction we have get allocated over fewer closings. And that's one of the reasons why the margins are lower in that first quarter.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. No, that makes sense. And just on this topic, longer-term, I think, Stuart, you mentioned that perhaps you'd be trying to shift over the next year or 2 towards more auctioning and faster-turnover type land deals. If you could just give us a sense what type of gross margin those might represent relative to the land that's flowing through now or that you've worked on, where you had more of a longer-term approach that, typically, higher risk, you require a little bit more of a margin to offset that. If -- certainly, from an, again, an operating margin perspective, you're looking for still very solid results and further leverage on SG&A, but would that also kind of influence this idea that, hey, gross margins might move a little bit perhaps away from peak, that the shift in land purchases are part of that overall comment?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes, listen, I think that we are looking at varied margins across the platform. Some of that -- some of the shorter-term land positions are kind of at our average, and some of them are down into the high teens. So it's really a varied mix across the platform. But I don't want to overstate the shorter-term positioning that we're taking. We are also looking at more conventional land sales. It's just that, given the fact that we are able to look for land for 2016, 2017, we're really able to put things under contract that we don't have to take down until later. And those will keep -- those will be underwritten to much higher margins. So really, our averages should remain very, very strong. Some of the shorter-term positions, where we have an operating platform that's already paid for and in place, really makes sense for the company as we drive volumes and prices going forward into the recovery.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And just clarification on a prior guidance. Can you just restate, Bruce, what you said the tax rate you expected to be for '14? And in the SG&A leverage, is that inclusive of corporate G&A? Or would you expect, maybe, another 10 or 20 bps of incremental leverage on the corporate G&A side?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. We did bring down our expectations for our tax rate for next year from 38% to 37.75%. And the 25 basis points of leverage I would look at as a combined leverage between those 2 categories at this point.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about the Rialto lending business. Can you speak to the kinds of loans you're looking to close and what the pipeline is and whether you -- I think your comments alluded to this, but whether you would do any on-balance sheet lending, such as transitional first mortgages and mezzanine loans?
Stuart A. Miller: Jeff?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: In terms of the securitization business, what we're doing is we're originating what would be more typical conduit loans, which are stabilized loans on pretty much everything from office, retail, hotel, et cetera. So it's pretty much straightforward. There's clearly an active and growing market in that arena, and our team has been doing it for over 20 years. As it relates to transitional lending, we are not doing any balance sheet transitional lending. And we are doing some mezzanine loans, but we're doing those mezzanine loans, as Stuart mentioned, in a separate vehicle, for which we are in the process of raising additional capital right now.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Great. Can you talk about if -- I mean, what you kind of expect for overall origination volume next year and what the size of the current pipeline is? And if you could just speak to the average loan size that you're able to take down?
Stuart A. Miller: We haven't started looking forward and putting out projected numbers. This is still -- we still view ourselves as being in a startup mode. We think that the $700 million of originations and securitization in the fourth quarter gives a good indication of the potential power in this segment of our Rialto business. And we do think that, over time, it's going to help define and refine a visible and predictable stream of earnings. But I think it's a little too early to start putting out projected numbers and to start putting too much quarterly pressure on that group. As I say, we're still starting up and getting the engine well oiled.
Operator: The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: You mentioned -- I think, it was in the release that the -- and in your prepared commentary, that the Rialto segment was transitioning into more of an asset-light segment. And I was curious -- I understand the light activities that you're doing there. I was curious what the -- if there was any change or any speedup in terms of the plans for disposition of the more heavier assets, meaning the FDIC and the bank portfolios, and what the strategy there is?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. As we're positioned right now, we have about $400 million invested on balance sheet in some of those earlier asset-heavy kind of acquisitions. We expect, over the -- if you kind of straight-line over the next 3 years, we think that's kind of a good benchmark. There will be some stragglers that go into the fourth, but that's kind of a good benchmark as to how those assets will be liquidated and, ultimately, come back into cash. As far as investing going forward, we really aren't doing any new investing outside of the platforms that we have in place. And of course, with the $1.3 billion raise now basically completed, that gives us a lot of runway in terms of being able to invest in new assets going forward. And the mezzanine program, of course, is a complement to the fund management business that we've had in place to date.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then, did I hear correctly that the FDIC loan is paid off, so that, that $400 million, or the underlying investments behind that $400 million, will start flowing back to you now?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes, that's correct. We had a little over $600 million of debt that had to be paid off in its entirety first. That was paid off in 2013. And we are already seeing cash flowing back on the equity investment. Jeff, what was the amount that's actually come back?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: It was -- in total, so far, it's $80 million. We're 40% of that, so it's a little over $30 million that's coming back -- that has come back or is coming back over the next couple of days.
Stuart A. Miller: And we anticipate seeing greater cash flows as we go through 2014.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Gentlemen, versus your guidance, do you think you're more likely to be over on gross margins or closings? As it seems to imply, your guidance for closings, vis-à-vis your community count, seems to imply only modest sales gains in the sales pace, so basically seasonality. What does that ramp look like in communities off the 4Q base?
Stuart A. Miller: Look, the balance between volume and margin is more of an art than a science, and we'll have to manage that as market conditions present themselves. I think the question as to whether we're more likely to beat on one or the other, I think that we're giving guidance thinking that's where we're going to actually be. And as we go through the year and as we feel market conditions present themselves, I think we're going to navigate that balance on a day-by-day basis in each division at a very local level. One of the complications in our business is the business is so local that, that balance being struck at the local levels, you can't really nationalize what's actually happening until you actually roll up the numbers. So to give you a good answer on that, as it stands right now, I would -- looking at -- looking ahead to next year, I would have to say where we're more likely to outperform is probably both, and that's kind of our feeling right now. But staying conservative, we've given numbers that we feel comfortable with.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And if I could follow up, given your -- I appreciate your conversion rates. I think it tends to reflect the fact that you build homes outside of backlog. Could you comment on the margin spread you are seeing between spec homes and backlog? Given the conversion rate, that could be part of your margin swing as well. And, to the extent you noticed a difference between spec buyers who might be moving related to jobs compared to someone that's perhaps more patient and taking down a home out of backlog?
Stuart A. Miller: Jon, you've been quiet. Why don't you take that one?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Those tend to be higher-margin on our backlog, which are presales before construction. But as Stuart said, it's a very local business. And that will range dramatically from state to state and even within local markets, depending on product type. So a multi-family condo or townhome will have a smaller spread than, perhaps, a larger single-family home. But we do see the buyers who are relocation tend to be more of that spec buyers or someone coming out of an apartment, whereas someone coming out of an existing home is someone, typically, that is going to be a presale.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: My first question, obviously, the pickup in incentives was very small. And I not to put too fine a focus on it, but I kind of want to think a little bit bigger term here and think about other builders are reacting when they're seeing an increased use of incentives. Are you finding your competitors in markets are trying to match you guys, outdo you for sales at this point, or are they kind of holding back more? And I mean, how would you expect that -- just given your historical experience, how do you think that's going to play out as you go through the selling season if it ends up that demand isn't quite as good as you think?
Stuart A. Miller: I think that everybody is really carefully managing the balance between leveraging their overhead, increasing their average sales price and maximizing the good land assets that they have, recognizing that they're very, very difficult to replace. So you have, in my opinion, a very responsible competitive environment pretty much across the platform right now. And if you think about that and put it in historical perspective, David, there have been times where land has been more plentiful and more easily replaceable. And in those kinds of times, you probably have a much more competitive spirit in terms of just driving volume. That does not seem to be the case right now. Everybody's trying to manage that balance between volume and maximizing return on what they view as a scarce asset.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: That's very helpful color. I was wondering, Stuart, you've given some really good color on the mortgage market loosening in past quarters. And I wonder if you could talk about kind of what you've seen in the most recent quarter? I know you talked about the FHFA and higher G fees and maybe some changes with the FHA, but as you look out to 2014, what are your expectations in terms of mortgage market, maybe from reemergence of private mortgage insurers and the impact that's going to have on the entry level as we move kind of into the next stage of this recovery?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, we're at an interesting inflection point where the mortgage market is evolving, in a free market sense, but the government is very involved, and there are a lot of opinions at the governmental level right now. We see an outgoing Ed DeMarco waving goodbye in a very complicated way at a complicated time with the announcement yesterday. And we have an unknown in the incoming head of FHFA. I think that everybody's aware that a derailing of the mortgage market in the context of a somewhat tepid recovery to date is problematic for overall economic recovery. So I think we're going to have to kind of wait and see over the next month how the mortgage market presents itself and what kind of governmental adjustments will or might be made. I wouldn't be surprised if some of what's been that gets rolled back. I wouldn't be surprised if there are more incremental difficulties presented for the mortgage market. That being said, I think that they will be incremental. I think that the overall housing market will find its way to adjusting, and we'll have to navigate our way through it. But I think that there are some question marks and headwinds out there, but I think that the strength in the recovery and general strength in the economy are going to overcome them.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: But is it fair to surmise you're not expecting much loosening as you move into next year as you kind of look out to your estimates in your land purchasing?
Stuart A. Miller: That I would not be expecting as much loosening? I think the banks are going to continue to loosen. Remember, the refi business has all but evaporated. It's a small shadow of itself. And the banks are really replacing some of that income stream by taking away some of the overlays that they've had in place. I think there's likely to be some loosening as we go forward, but there will be some counterbalancing to that with some other elements, higher interest rates and other things. But overall, I think, everybody is holding hands, recognizing that a vibrant mortgage market is the key to the housing market continuing its recovery and, ultimately, to creating jobs and creating economic prosperity across the country.
Operator: The last question is coming from Jack Micenko, SIG.
Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Two questions. First one. Looking at, first, wondering if you could help us on homebuilding land sales. The top line sale number's come down year-to-year, and I'm thinking about it in the context of slowing your land investment and more of this old high-margin land becoming more of the mix. Should we think about homebuilding land sales continuing to decline on sort of the trajectory we saw in '13 versus '12, or can you give us any feel for how that would look, potentially, for modeling purposes?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. From the standpoint of modeling purposes, we're not expecting much in the way of sales of land. So the number came down. We're certainly not anticipating it -- sometimes, you have the opportunity to move out of one position into another opportunity that's nearby. So generally, we're not anticipating land sales. If they happen, it's more of a strategic focus as we're looking at other opportunities. But for modeling purposes, generally, we don't model land sales, and it's something I would say not to include in the model any land profit. It's not what we're focused on.
Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then, Jeff, on the commercial mortgage side. With the $700 million in production, I'm wondering if you're seeing any behavior changes at the competitor banks. Are they potentially responding based on -- if you're hearing anything around price on the spread or maybe on the term or duration of the loan, anything there, as you sort of create another option for stabilized borrowers out there?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: It's a competitive market, but we have a very, very strong eye on credit. So we maintain our position. But it's a growing market. And you have -- over the next several years, you have hundreds of billions of dollars of loans that are coming up -- coming to maturity that are going to need to be refinanced. So we see our position as a great position as that market continues to expand.
Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Good. And then, on the credit side, do you said you have recourse on those loans. And what's the nature of the recourse if you do?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: The typical conduit loan is a nonrecourse loan, and we're looking to the credit of the underlying real estate as support for the -- and again, these are stabilized assets that have cash loans coming from rents or under leases.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay. Very good. That wraps up our conference call for 2013. We look forward to reporting a successful 2014. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our third quarter 2013 update. We're very pleased to share our results with you this morning. This morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; David Collins, who you've just heard from, who is our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here with us for our Q&A session. And Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is available for Q&A from California by phone. I'd like to begin this morning with some brief overview comments on the overall state of the housing recovery in the context of today's ever-changing market conditions, and then briefly overview our operations. Bruce then is going to, as usual, provide greater detail on our overall numbers, as well as some further comments on our Financial Services segment. And then, as always, we'll open up for Q&A. As in the past, we'd like to request that during Q&A, each person limits themselves to one question and just one related follow-up. So let me begin. In preparation for today's call, I reviewed my comments from last quarter's conference call to consider those comments and see how my thoughts might have changed. When we reported last quarter, our results were very solid, though the interest rate environment had begun to change, and talk of the pending taper of federal stimulus had just recently begun. We believed then, as we do now, that, generally speaking, the housing market remains in a solid recovery mode and is likely to continue to improve over an extended period of time. While the rate of that improvement is likely to moderate as the market has now snapped back from the abnormally severe downturn that we experienced, we nevertheless believe it will continue to improve. Clearly, interest rates have moved higher and mortgage rates have moved from their unprecedented low point towards more normalized levels. Accordingly, over the past couple of months, we've experienced a slowdown in our sales pace and traffic in our communities as the consumer has adjusted to the change in the interest rate environment. But it is our belief that this change is mild and temporary given the extremely low levels of housing inventory in the market. In our view, the primary driver of our business strategy is that the housing recovery is still very much intact and that the fundamentals of that recovery remain solid. The overriding driver of recovery in the housing market remains the production deficit of both single family and multi-family product throughout the economic downturn, and up to and including this year. This year, even with significantly stronger building activity, we will produce approximately 900,000 to 950,000 single and multi-family dwellings, and again, will underserve the country's needs by a wide margin. We have more than absorbed the overbuilding of the early- to mid-2000s and have been underproducing for a protracted period of time. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the builders of both multi- and single family products have been pushing to increase production as inventories of rentals, existing homes and new homes have remained extremely low, and pricing for all of these products have been moving up. And inventories are likely to remain low as production increases are constrained by a shortage of entitled and developed land to build on. Interest rates, though somewhat higher, are still at historically very acceptable levels. Consumer perception at this point remains that today's low interest rate still presents a unique opportunity to lock in a very low cost of capital, and this opportunity might not be available forever. Even with more significant movement in both interest rates and pricing, homes remain affordable by all measures and will continue to remain attractive relative to rental options as well. Finally, while demand for homes has been constrained by an overly restrictive mortgage market, which has limited access to home ownership with highly conservative underwriting criteria, the landscape continues to improve as lenders are beginning to reconsider their credit underwriting overlays and open the doors for more approvals. While this process has been and continues to be slow to mature, we've come a long way since last year at this time, and we expect to see further easing of credit standards to normalized levels and further extension of credit to the markets. As we've seen over the past quarter, there have been, and still are, economic and political uncertainties ahead that will affect and bring questions to the future of housing. The pending debt ceiling debate, the future of the taper discussion and the international swirl around Syria and the Middle East will all produce bumps in the housing recovery road. We continue to feel, however, that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for dwelling units. We believe we're still in the beginning stages of a recovery that will be sustained for several more years. And strategically, this is how we are positioning Lennar for the upcoming years. Now turning to Lennar specifically, we feel that our company is really hitting on all cylinders. Lennar has been and continues to be very well positioned for current market conditions and recovery in housing. This is reflective in our third quarter 2013 results and in our positioning for the future. In our third quarter, new orders were up 14% over last year, while our new order dollar value of $1.5 billion was up 32% over the prior year. Our dollar value of backlog is up 53%. Gross margins improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 24.9%, a 170-basis-point increase over last year. And operating margins increased 350 basis points to 14.7%, reflecting the powerful operating leverage in our platform. For the fourth quarter 2013, we expect that our gross margins will remain consistent with current levels. Margins continue to benefit from our aggressive land acquisition strategy, as well as higher home prices and operating leverage. While recent sales have seen a mild increase in the use of incentives on selected inventory, margins are remaining steady. During the quarter, we continued our aggressive land acquisition strategy and closed on approximately 11,600 homesites for approximately $610 million. And that land has basically been contracted for between 1 and 2 years prior to its closing. Additionally, we spent $160 million on bringing land to developed status and ready for production. Our average selling price for the third quarter was $291,000, a 13% increase over last year, which covered the increases in labor and material costs which increased approximately 8.4% over the prior year to around $45 per square foot. Lumber costs have been -- have recently come down, but this has been offset by increases in labor. The most labor-constrained categories are framing, drywall, plumbing and concrete. We expect that costs for fourth quarter closings will be slightly higher than our third quarter. But our average selling price of homes in the third quarter was up 16%, and those price increases will continue to cover the increase in costs. Our Homebuilding operations continue to improve due to the strong operating strategy, strong land position, complemented by an excellent management team and management execution. Additionally, we opened 77 new communities and closed out 57 communities during the quarter to end up with -- to end up at 514 active communities, a 16% year-over-year increase. Today, we are fortunate to have land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014 and much of 2015 as well. And as a result, we're pursuing land opportunities for 2015 and beyond. Complementing our Homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating earnings of $23.5 million, down slightly from the $25.3 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 70% -- 77% of Lennar home buyers within the markets in which we operate. The mortgage operations have benefited from a robust refinancing market in past quarters that -- and that part of the business is now starting to subside. Lennar home mortgages continues to grow, however, alongside our expanding Homebuilding business, as well as serve a number of non-Lennar purchasers in a growing number of markets, making up some of the shortfall from the slowing of the refi business. While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating segments are all maturing to be excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to grow as a blue chip capital investment management company and commercial real estate capital provider. While current earnings have slowed as we have shifted from the balance sheet investment model to a fund investment model, the prospects for future consistent earnings continue to improve. In Fund 1, we invested approximately $1 billion of equity in 60 separate transactions, and actual performance continues to well exceed our original projections. So in addition to being able to recycle and invest an additional $300 million of capital with only 2 -- within only 2 quarters subsequent to becoming fully invested, we have already been able to distribute $365 million to our investors, or over 50% of their initial capital contributed. In addition, if we continue on our current path, the carried interest to Rialto as manager of the fund will exceed our expectations, and none of that potential is yet reflected in our current earnings picture. While Fund 1 is now fully invested, our opportunistic program has continued uninterrupted through our second real estate fund, which has already closed private equity commitments of almost $650 million compared to the $260 million reported at the end of the second quarter. And this is well on its way towards our goal of raising approximately $1 billion by year end. Fund 2 has already invested over $230 million in 17 separate transactions. And following on the theme of high-return-on-capital businesses, earlier this year, we brought on board one of the industry's most experienced commercial real estate origination groups led by Brett Ersoff and John Herman. Our initial objective for Rialto Mortgage Finance has been to originate and securitize long-term fixed rate loans on stabilized, cash-flowing, institutional-grade commercial real estate properties. And this program is now well on its way to profitability. Although the shorter-term earnings have slowed, we have morphed into a private equity and high-return-on-capital program, and our Rialto program is maturing on plan. We are very excited about the long-term prospects for value creation from this platform. As with Rialto, we're really pleased with the progress of our multi-family rental business. This business began operations in early 2011 and is positioned to become one of the leading developers of new Class A apartments in the United States. We have assembled a seasoned team of professionals that is leveraging every aspect of our company. In the third quarter, we commenced construction on 2 new apartment communities and now have seen -- and now have 7 active projects totaling 2,100 apartments with an estimated development cost of approximately $326 million. Including these active communities, today, we have a geographically diversified development pipeline that exceeds $2.5 billion and over 11,000 apartments. As we've discussed in the past, we're building these apartments with third-party institutional capital, and each deal has been conservatively financed with non-recourse debt. In addition, we have underwritten our investments using today's rents and unlevered yield on costs that are 125 to 200 basis points over the prevailing cap rate. With our conservative financing and underwriting, we're positioned to earn IRRs exceeding 25% and cash multiples greater than 2x. We anticipate that the construction of our development pipeline will be completed over the next 3 to 4 years. As a merchant builder of apartments, we plan to sell our apartments once rents and occupancies have stabilized. Given our construction timeline, we should begin to see returns on invested capital by the middle of 2014 with a more meaningful contribution from the multi-family segment in fiscal 2015. Finally, our FivePoint Communities program continues to mature as a long-term strategy as well and is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium California locations to the market to fill the growing demand for well-located, approved and developed homesites. In the second quarter, we saw the first earnings contribution from this division which will continue to contribute as additional land becomes entitled and developed over the next years. Again, we believe that FivePoint Communities will create excellent long-term shareholder value. In conclusion, let me say that while we are aware of the concerns that are being reflected in current market volatility, our company's strategies continues to be driven by our belief that the market remains positioned to continue to recover, and that our company remains well positioned to benefit. The housing market is healing and recovering, and we -- as we produce shelter that is needed for a growing population and return to more normal levels of household formation. Lennar's Homebuilding operation is extremely well positioned and continues to gain market share. We have excellent land positions in all of our major markets while the overall market is still very constrained, and we have continued to fortify that position. Our Homebuilding operations will continue to be the company's primary driver of current earnings. Homebuilding, of course, is supported and enhanced by our Financial Services division, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance the bottom line. Our ancillary businesses of Rialto, Lennar multi-family communities and FivePoint continue to mature and expand their franchises and will continue to provide longer-term opportunities to enhance shareholder value in the longer term. Although there continues to be political and economic headline risks, the primary drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. I'm confident of Lennar's position in the marketplace today as our strong balance sheet and exceptional group of leaders will continue to be able to navigate through the challenges of today's market landscape and towards opportunities ahead. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the third quarter were $0.54 per diluted share, and I'm going to review the financial highlights, starting with Homebuilding. Our results reflected strong top line growth as our revenues from home sales increased 55% in the third quarter, driven by a 37% increase in deliveries and a 13% year-over-year increase in average sales price to $291,000. That sale price by region is as follows: the East region was $261,000, up 7%; Southeast Florida region was $299,000, up 8%; Central region, $261,000, up 16%; Houston was $272,000, up 15%; the West region was $361,000, up 21%; and other region was $394,000, up 10%. The 24.9% gross margin that was up 170 basis points over the prior year was driven primarily by new communities purchased after 2008, which continued to outperform the company's average gross margin and they represented in this quarter 61% of the company's deliveries. Sales incentives were $18,700 per home in the third quarter, or 6% as a percent of home sale revenue. The sales incentives improved by 330 basis points, or $7,400 per home delivered versus the prior year. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was the highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. SG&A percent as a percent of revenues from home sales improved 180 basis points to 10.2%, and we are realizing significant operating leverage as our Homebuilding volumes increased. That resulted in a 350-basis-point improvement in our operating margin. Additionally, we have seen significant operating leverage in our corporate G&A line as our corporate G&A improved 60 basis points to 2.3% as a percent of revenue during the quarter. During the quarter, equity in the earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $10.3 million versus a loss of $6 million in the prior year. This is primarily a result of income related to the sale of homesites at our El Toro joint venture to third-party builders. Turning to Financial Services. As Stuart mentioned, our earnings were $23.5 million in the quarter versus $25.3 million in the prior year. Our mortgage pretax income decreased during the quarter to $18.8 million from $22.3 million in the prior year. As I have been highlighting for a few quarters, we have been expecting the number of refinanced transactions to decline and the profit per transaction to moderate, and we did see that in our results this quarter. Our Eagle Mortgage retail channel experienced a reduction in refinance volume from 49% of the total originations being refinance-oriented versus now 26% in the current quarter. Our Universal American Mortgage Company subsidiary provides mortgages to our home buyer customers and, therefore, almost all of these are purchase transactions. In total, our mortgage operations are now 88% purchase transactions and 12% refinance transactions. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 7% to $1.4 billion as we have been effective in growing our purchase transactions to offset the reductions in refinances. However, there has been margin compression in the market as a result of more competition targeting the purchase business. Our Title Company had a $5.2 million profit in the third quarter, and this compares with a $3.6 million profit in the prior year. And this is on a 7% increase in revenues. Turning to Rialto. We generated $1.5 million of profits compared to $7.7 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of those profits by type of investment is as follows: the Rialto Real Estate Funds contributed $5.2 million of earnings; the FDIC and wholly-owned bank portfolios contributed a net of $2 million of earnings, and these amounts were reduced by $5.7 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $9.3 million. One thing to note, the prior year amount included $15.4 million of earnings from the PPIP program, which was successfully completed in 2012. The FDIC originally provided $627 million of seller financing, which had to be repaid before we could make distributions back to the company. As of today, we now have enough cash in Rialto to fully retire the remaining debt balance, which will allow us to make additional distributions in the coming quarters to the partners. Additionally, it positions Rialto with an underlevered balance sheet. Turning to our balance sheet, our balance sheet liquidity remained strong in the third quarter, with $434 million of cash and $100 million outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility. During the quarter, that credit facility was increased to $950 million, and its maturity was extended to June of 2017. Our stockholders' equity increased to $3.7 billion during the quarter, and our book value per share increased to $19.10. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 147,000 homesites. 119,000 are owned and 28,000 are controlled. Our completed unsold inventory remains low, averaging about 1 home per community. I wanted to summarize what's been said on this call and highlight a few additional items for the remainder of 2013. First, we remain comfortable with our backlog, and we continue to expect to deliver between 18,250 and 18,500 homes for all of 2013. This will result in a backlog conversion ratio exceeding 90% for the fourth quarter. Second, the strength of our backlog has given us confidence for our gross margin guidance to be maintained around the third quarter actual gross margin level of 24.9%. Third, Lennar Financial Services' earnings are expected to decrease sequentially from the third quarter as we book our mortgage profits based on loan locks, and this is due to the normal seasonality that occurs in our fourth quarter. And then last, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 36% as we were favorably benefited by several tax credits which were applicable to the third quarter. And as we look at the fourth quarter, we now expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 38%. And with that, let me turn it back to the operator and open it up for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Bob Wetenhall, RBC Capital.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to ask -- it was a strong quarter in terms of gross margin performance and incremental operating leverage. Could you help give us a sense of where you see gross margins going in the next 2 or 3 years if volumes continue to recover?
Bruce E. Gross: So Bob, looking forward, as we think about gross margins, there are several opportunities still for gross margins to grow. We think we have the opportunity for margins to exceed our past peak, which was around the 26% to 27% range if everything goes according to plan. And that's based on the following: it's based on average sales prices continuing to grow as there's still room and affordability; sales incentives still have room to go down from the current 6% level over time to what's more normal at 3%; we have more of our new communities that would come online that have a higher gross margin than the company average. Currently 61% of our deliveries, as I mentioned, were coming from new communities, so that should be helpful as well. And then as absorption increases and gets back to normalized levels, we have the ability to amortize fixed costs over more deliveries. So if everything happens according to plan, there is room for upward mobility in the margins over time. We think the next quarter, however, will probably be somewhere close to the level that you saw in the third quarter that we just reported.
Richard Beckwitt: Hey, Bob, this is Rick. Just one other thing I'd point out is, as we have typically discussed in the past, we're more focused on our operating margin than by -- than the gross margin. We're very focused on leveraging the overhead, the infrastructure of the company. We will, within any quarter, adjust pricing and pace to maximize the underlying value of the assets. So gross margins will move up and down, but the real thing you should focus on is the operating margin line.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: That's really informative. I appreciate the granular detail. If -- on a follow-up, Stuart had said that interest rates are probably having an impact on order growth, but he characterized the impact as been temporary and mild, and touched on the production deficit. If rates stay in the current context for 30-year fixed, how do you think the recovery looks from here on out during the next 12 months?
Stuart A. Miller: Bob, it's our view that the recovery -- it just continues forward. I think that the first move in both sales pace and pricing has been stronger than people anticipated, in large part because it's a reversion as opposed to just a straight-line recovery. When I say reversion, we had a very, very unusual downturn. It was much more severe than we've seen historically, and I think there's been somewhat of a snap back. The fact that the rate of growth in sales and sales price will and should moderate does not derail the recovery. We think that the recovery will be more orderly and slower in nature. But we think that over the next 3 to 5 years, we're likely to be in a steady recovery mode.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Stuart, you talked about what you were seeing with demand a little bit, if you could talk a little bit more just what you all were seeing as you went through the quarter and post-quarter for demand and pricing? And then as you go through this a bit slower time, what's your strategy? Or how has your strategy changed a little bit to navigate through this period?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. Let me turn that over to Rick and then to Jon. They have a real close -- they're in close touch with the people in the field, and you'll get a better answer from them. Rick?
Richard Beckwitt: As we look at the quarter, Steve, I would tell you that July was the slowest month for us, and we saw August actually being the strongest month on both a nominal and year-over-year basis. That was pretty much consistent with both number of sales and dollar pricing power. There was a little bit of sticker shock associated with the rate increase so dramatically, a little pause on the market, and we saw buyers starting to come back to the market. And as Stuart said in his opening comments and his talk about the economy, we see just strong viable fundamental demand out there. But it's cooled a little bit. As a result of that, we have -- from a pricing standpoint, we've selected some of our inventory, select inventory, and have increased some incentives associated with that inventory. But blended across the overall pool, it's got a relatively modest impact on pricing and net sales price. It varies dramatically by market. The A communities are performing extremely well, and -- but we're really focused on discounting. If there was discounting on stuff that was ready to close and we -- it was just the best way for us to focus on a return on investment. Jon, any further comments?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: As we manage through what is apparently more of a normal season, as Bruce highlighted, we're focused on our unsold inventory, which is about one home per community. And we'll manage the levers of price and pace to make sure those homes are delivered, they're sold and they close, and that will create some fluctuations from community to community. But as I look at our backlog and look at the end of third quarter sequentially compared to the second quarter, I feel very comfortable that we are managing our average sales price in a level or upward trend and the same with our gross margin. So I think we managed through this somewhat bumpier time because our inventory is under control -- we're not under pressure to incentivize any greater than the market needs to keep that pace.
Richard Beckwitt: And just a final thought on that, Steve. I think this is at the top of the mind of the market right now. What we're hearing from customers in the field, clearly there's a little bit of sticker shock relative to interest rates moving. At the same time, the prices have been moving up. We saw across the country, in the Case-Shiller report this morning, that prices are up in a healthy way. And so, as interest rates have moved, people have had to confront the fact that the price that they were looking at a few weeks ago might be different than the price -- or the monthly payment might be different than today. But by and large, they still have to measure their decision on where they're going to live against rental rates. And they still have to -- and they still have the opportunity to look at reasonably low interest rates that are going to hold them in good stead for years to come. The attitude of the consumer in the field still seems to be positively oriented towards finding a way to purchase and making it through the mortgage maze right now and finding their way into homeownership.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, if we look, you can grow 1 of 2 ways. You can buy the lots and the land or you can buy the company. There are -- both are pretty fluid right now on the M&A side. We're seeing some small deals, but then we also have the 2 big ones that are sitting out there and the land environment itself looks like it's getting a bit more rational. Can you talk about those 2 and how you all view your appetite for potential M&A? And then, what's actually going on in the land market?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. As has been the case with our company for a very long time, there is nothing that we don't look at and consider. We look at M&A the same way that we look at organic growth. It's all about competing capital, and we measure the returns on capital that we can generate from a company acquisition against comparably deployed capital in a well constructed organic program. And wherever the best returns for our company are going to lie, that's where we act. So there is nothing off the table as it relates to Lennar. We are focused on and have reviewed every M&A transaction that's out there, and we are looking at just about every organic opportunity to purchase new land positions. It's all about returns on the invested capital.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Has the land market changed?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, Steve, this is Rick. The land market has been going through a state of evolution, as we've discussed in the past because there are more ready-to-go, finished homesites out there that have been priced up. That's not to say that you can invest in communities that produce a good return and a decent gross margin. But clearly, not the margins that we've seen in current deliveries. And as a result of that, as Stuart mentioned, most of our land acquisition activity or contracting activity -- and I want to really focus on that -- things that we've been putting under contract are things that we'll probably be closing on in 2015, 2016, 2017. We benefit from the fact that we were early in, aggressive and you can see that reflected in the gross margins.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Two questions, and one question really pertains to incentives. Recognizing, I think, the way you described it, Stuart, is that you're using it selectively where necessary to move inventory. Maybe, Rick, you were the one that said it, 1 per community. One of the concerns we have is that unlike any other cycle we've actually seen pricing spikes at the front end of the cycle and volumes usually are the ones to increase and follow that pricing. So now that we've weaned the consumer with the spike in pricing, off of incentives after 6 tough years of negotiations, aren't you opening up the door for a slippery slope of undermining consumers' confidence in the value of the homes they're buying? And not just you, I'm talking about the industry because there a lot of private builders that want to take their working capital out of the ground, and we're hearing more of them talk about using selling incentives. Although still moderate today, how do you control it? And in prior cycles, have you seen the use of selling incentives after periods where home prices had gone up and then see it resume?
Richard Beckwitt: Hey, Ivy, it's Rick. In any market, good, bad, modest, we have used incentives. The industry has used incentives whether it's closing costs, landscape packages, additional spiffs in the home. It's just part of the normal course of business. Those percentages of incentives change depending on the state of the inventory, the development status in the community, and it's just part of the normal course of business in the industry and in our company. What we identified is that we are -- we have started to use a little bit more. And by a little bit, we're talking maybe 1 point, 1.5 points on selected inventory out there in order to get some activity. And it may be 3 or 4 homes in that community, but not necessarily anything beyond that. It's a price leader. It gets activity out to the job.
Stuart A. Miller: Let me just back up for 1 second, and you talked about the spike in pricing as opposed to pace and the like. But let's now remember that a large part of this recovery has been defined by very, very limited inventory both in existing homes and in new homes and, frankly, in apartments. And so, it's not surprising to see the recovery reflected more in pricing than in pace because you simply can't get the pace where inventories are low and land is very constrained. And that's what we're seeing out in the field. And then, additionally, you look at the smaller builder component of the overall industry, the smaller builders have not been able to come back in the sizable way that they have in prior recoveries. So as I articulated before, I think that price -- the initial movement in price is somewhat of a spike and a reversion to where pricing might have been in a normalized downturn. We'll see more moderate reflection in price as we go forward. And as the market goes through minor gyrations and corrections on the way to a broader recovery, we think that we'll have to use incentives on a select basis. But the limitation of inventory is going to be definitional to where the market goes and how we price going forward.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay. That was very helpful. One more question. A big bad bear view out there that I'd like you to dispel if possible is that today the housing starts normalizing given the deficit shelter out there with respect to single-family production predominantly if you can drill in on that. Given where your average home price is and many of the builders focused on more of a move up, more affluent buyer. With today's student loan debt and the young adults that historically have been a first-time home buyer, many believe this demand just isn't there with credit constraints and debt burdens that today's first-time entry market won't be there to support a resumption or a normalized level of new construction predominantly on single family. Can you comment please, Stuart, on that?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. Look, I think over the past just few weeks, you've started to see some of the banks in the context of a declining refi market -- you've seen some of the banks start to talk about the adjustment of some of their overlays as it relates to mortgage approvals. I think that everyone, from the banking world to the political world, is acutely aware of some of the impediments to the first-time homebuyer market finding its way back into this housing recovery. And I think that solid work and thinking is being brought to bear in the market. It doesn't mean we're seeing broad swings of first-time homebuyers being able to find mortgage approval. But I think, as we look ahead, we're likely to see that open up, open up first at the margins and then revert to normal levels of underwriting standards, which should enable first-time buyers to get back into the market and open up the market in general.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Will you provide the lots for that entry-level buyer with respect to recognizing whereas today your average home prices are? Strategically, do you feel that that's a market that you'll expand as the market fluctuates or the credit loosens? How should we think about the industry's penetration of that market? Is it fluid?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, I think -- look, we have a diversified offering, a diversified program and have over decades now. We have a sizable first-time buyer component. We'll continue to focus on that part of the market as opportunity opens up. And we'll remain focused on gross margins as well. I guess the question is, does that mean that as you average in first-time buyers, does average sales price start to decline somewhat as a matter of averaging and I guess we'll have to wait and see how big a component it is. But remember, we are bottom-line return-on-capital-focused. And so, where opportunity presents itself, we'll be focusing on our operating margin first and foremost.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So there's been a lot of talk on incentives. I think you guys obviously did a good job, better than we were fearing actually in the quarter on incentives actually coming down. But I guess, in general, you've talked about stepping up the incentive activity a little bit here. Can you give us a sense for what the response has been so far on the part of buyers to this very selective increasing of incentives on standing inventory?
Stuart A. Miller: Let me have Jon and then Rick take that.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: I think you can see, by the fact that we have very little standing inventory, that we have used those selective incentives very carefully and very effectively. And they are a lever that each of our divisions exercises community by community, home by home to make sure we're accomplishing that goal. But I think we feel very comfortable that we're -- we have the right amount to move the inventory that we want to make sure we move. So as we get to month end and quarter end, we're in a very similar position that we're in now.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes. Steve, as you look at the operation of the business, the incentives for the consumer haven't really moved the needle per se. It's really a way for us to generate activity from the brokerage community, and it's a traffic generator. When people come out to the communities, they still find sentimental value. And whether there is an additional 1%, 0.5%, 2%, it's not what is impacting the investment decision.
Stuart A. Miller: Just let me add as a third thought here. In the context of sticker shock, everybody wants a deal, everybody wants to feel that they've lost a little bit and they're getting a little bit back. So it's just an ignition point right now to just keep the market kind of attentive in the context of a time when pricing moved on people.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes. That's very helpful. Another question that I had -- I guess a second question, sort of a broader question about your opportunities that you see currently in the land market and for your company generally. You've talked about the fact that you're stepping up and you've been very active on the land purchasing side. We can see that in the numbers that you've provided, much higher levels than relative to your burn rate, if you will, than is -- would be considered sustainable, and that I would say almost double what would be considered sustainable. So clearly, there's a cyclical component to what you're pursuing. But you've also talked about shortages in the land market more broadly. That struck me as being also somewhat cyclical and, therefore, somewhat temporary. And I'm curious as to whether you can comment on how much longer you think the land market is going to be in its current severely constrained state so that it would justify your accelerated level of land purchases. We're talking 2 years, 3 years? Do you think this is somewhat systemic? If you could just give us some sense of that, that would be great.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay. You're clearly noting that we've remained an aggressive purchaser of land. As we've noted, this started a number of years ago. We were early to the land purchasing program, and we've maintained that early position -- the properties that we're closing on in large dollar amounts today, the properties that we've contracted for at a much earlier stage. We remain focused on the land side of the business. The land market is constrained, and we would rather be buying early rather than late. We have a 3- to 5-year time horizon on this recovery. We've articulated that, and that defines and informs a good portion of our strategy. To your question about how long will the land market remain constrained, of course, I can't answer that definitively, but it's been -- our view has been formed by the fact that like the smaller homebuilders, the land developer business has had difficulty gaining access to capital except through opportunity-type funds where the cost of capital is rather steep. And so, this acts as its own constraint to the expansion of the supply of land inventory in the marketplace. So at least, for the foreseeable future, until capital markets find a way and with non-opportunistic capital to open up to land developers, we think that land continues to remain constrained and, therefore, constrain inventories overall.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Let me just add one more thought to Stuart's comment is that compared to the last cycle, the environmental, in an entitlement situation, the conditions are much stricter than they were last cycle. So that's going to add to the capital situation land developers face, and I think continue to have a slightly more constrained land environment as we move forward.
Richard Beckwitt: And, Steve, I guess, the final point is, strategically, assuming that there is a new level of development -- third-party development activity coming on stream 2 years, 3 years out, it really plays strategically with how we've invested our capital because we have the ability to supplement our core purchases with incremental immediate delivery opportunities as the market unfolds and starts to continue to grow. And we think that it's consistent with what our overall strategy has been from the get-go.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just a quick one on your average sales price. Given the average order price, do you expect the average sales price on deliveries in the fourth quarter to be in the $300,000 range?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. Jade, if you look at our backlog average sales price, it always runs a little bit higher than what we actually deliver because the larger homes sit in backlog a little bit longer. So we would expect there to be a slight increase in the average sales price going into the fourth quarter.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just on Rialto. I think you mentioned the balance sheet is underlevered with the FDIC debt having been fully defeased. Can you talk about options to add leverage? And on Rialto Mortgage Finance, when do you think that the CMBS loan conduit originations would commence in full and start contributing to earnings?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. Well, look, I think that we have created a terrific optionality in our subsidiary operations. And clearly, that's one point of access to capital that we have in our arsenal. Rialto is really well situated today, having defeased the FDIC debt, with a very strong balance sheet. It's positioned as a stand-alone enterprise that is separately reported. We have all of the levers available to us.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Available for the addition of leverage?
Stuart A. Miller: Leveraged equity -- we've really maintained maximum flexibility in terms of -- by segmenting the business. And as we've grown the business in an unlevered way, we've just afforded ourselves maximum flexibility to go in a number of different directions.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: And the loan conduit, do you think that is something that would contribute to earnings in 2014?
Stuart A. Miller: As I noted in my remarks, we have brought on an exceptional team in that space. It is -- they've been working hard getting positioned. While we haven't projected profitability, we think that we're well positioned for profitability in 2014.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut at JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question I had was on sales pace. So far this year, you've been doing plus or minus 3 to 4 a month on average. And as far as my understanding, generally, builders will typically look for, depending on the market, et cetera, 4 per month is a pretty good yardstick, maybe sometimes a little more depending on the ASP and the density. Is there something that you're comfortable with at this stage in the cycle? And as we get more towards, let's say, the middle part of the cycle, would you see that sales pace change at all materially?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, listen, absorption rates are a cyclical phenomenon. I think that if you look at our absorption rate for this quarter, it was somewhere around 3.2%. If you look at last quarter, the spring selling season, we were closer to 4%. And sales pace moves around a little bit, as you go through the seasonality of the year. So I think we're comfortable with where our sales pace has been, and we feel that, again, the market continues to be pretty solid.
Richard Beckwitt: The other thing I'd like to add to that, Michael, is as we purchase communities and underwrite communities with various absorption paces depending on the type of asset that we're buying, and they range from sort of higher end, more affluent type of opportunities where maybe we're looking at an absorption pace of 1.5% to 2% because the operating margins on those closings are so significant, and it justifies the investment of capital. Then there are some communities that we're projecting 4, 5, 6, 7 because it's more of a volume-oriented opportunity. And what skews some of the pace that you see quarter-to-quarter is the mix of deliveries that we're closing from the communities that we have across the country.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: No, I understand and I appreciate that. It's kind of why I gave a range of 3 to 4 and understanding seasonality. I guess I was just thinking more from the perspective that there are other builders, let's say, that have kind of put sales pace out there and said, "Hey, you know, relative to the early 2000s, late 1990s, overall, we're still 25%, 30%, even off of our what we consider a normalized sales pace with all those factors considered." I was just wondering if that's a statement that applies to you or that, again, given the mix and everything else, that the sales pace that you're currently seeing is something that you would expect either more in the middle of the cycle or maybe that's just not the case for you that you're more or less hitting what you were hoping to hit as the communities are coming through?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, I can tell you that we're exceeding underwriting with regards to pace for the most part. That on a historical basis, absorptions have been higher at various points of cycles and we run the business to maximize the operating margin in the individual communities.
Stuart A. Miller: I would just add that we manage our pace also to match our construction pace. And again, we've mentioned a few times about our low level of spec homes. We really don't want to sell at a faster pace than we're constructing homes. And that, of course, is somewhat controlled by our community count and the land supply that we've spoken about.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: No, I appreciate. That's helpful. I guess, second question just on equity earnings in Rialto, the $10 million of profit in the equity earnings line, I guess, from some additional sales of homesites from El Toro, when you reported the profit from El Toro last quarter, I believe then you said that you would be releasing the next phase somewhere over the -- in mid '14. Just thinking about that, going forward, is that something that, the $10 million or this additional flow of lot sales, is that something that we should expect to be a little bit more regular? And also -- I'm sorry to kind of bring in another question. But on Rialto, now that you've defeased the debt, should we expect a different flow of earnings from the -- now that the distributions might come in a little bit more on a regular basis?
Bruce E. Gross: Let me answer the first question, Mike. With respect to the joint venture profit, we didn't sell additional homesites than the 726. There was some profit relating to the 726 homesites that were booked in this quarter. We still believe that the next group of homesites at El Toro are about, call it, sometime in 2014. So we didn't elect to sell additional homesites at this point. And then, relative to additional earnings in Rialto, because the debt's defeased, there's nothing there. So that doesn't pair up well relative to the debt being defeased. So as far as earnings go going forward, there'd be no change.
Operator: The next question is coming from Eli Hackel, Goldman Sachs.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just 2 questions. First, Stuart, you mentioned a little bit more on banks loosening up. Can you just give a little bit more color? It sounded like in the last couple of weeks you noticed a change, have you seen anything related to just them saying, well, QRM is here, refi revenue is down, wanting to make that up? And then, just on the incentives, I know you talked about it a little bit, but is there any region or price point that was more prevalent in?
Stuart A. Miller: Bruce, why don't you go ahead? I think as it relates to the banks, the banks have made their own announcements.
Bruce E. Gross: Yes. I'm sorry. Could you just repeat that first part, Eli?
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sure. Just in the beginning of some prepared remarks and some questions, just from banks maybe potentially loosening up a little bit more. You said you noticed some signs of that. I just was hoping for a little bit more color there, and then sort of how fast could that -- maybe it speeds up, but the refi revenue is down 50% or 60%. I just wanted your thoughts there.
Bruce E. Gross: Yes, sure. So what we did here with some of the major banks is that FICO scores have been announced that they've been reduced into the low 600 range. And then, additionally, in several states, the down payment requirement has come down to as low as 5%, and that is something that we believe is being implemented over the next month. So you're starting to see some benefit there. And in addition to that, you're also seeing that there's more mortgage insurance that's being used. In this quarter, over 1/3 of our conventional buyers had down payments less than 20%. And down payment is the biggest issue for our buyers typically. So we think that's very helpful for what's already changed and what's coming down the pike over the next month or so from the banks. So as refinance volume, as you mentioned, continues to trail off, that's a big component of bank earnings as we all know, and you're seeing the layoffs out there. And so, the tendency would be we would expect for a continuing easing with some of the overlays that they've had in place. So we look at that as real positive going forward.
Stuart A. Miller: But I think you've actually seen JPMorgan and Wells make announcements that their underwriting standards are starting to moderate, especially as that refi business has bled off.
Bruce E. Gross: Right.
Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then, just on incentives, just if they were concentrated in a region or price point?
Stuart A. Miller: The incentives have been pretty widespread -- I mean, across the country and have been in select communities, where they might have been needed as a re-spark.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So your guys' delivery can come through more communities or greater sales pace. If the sales pace is going to follow vagaries of the market, and it seems where it is seasonal versus cyclical right now. Can you -- with all your land in hand, can you give us -- or comment on '14's expected community count -- growth rate right now?
Bruce E. Gross: We haven't laid that out at this point, Ken. That's -- we're intending to give an update into 2014 on our next conference call, which we're expecting to be about the 3rd week of December.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then, the second point. With your closing guidance suggesting mid-90% backlog turn, it obviously indicates quite a bit of pre-built homes already in inventory. So does that -- 2 questions here, does that approach -- is that more common in less land-constrained areas, or are you actually using that kind of pre-built but not sold on the price as the way to kind of leverage price gains, kind of call options for your margins. What's in that, is there -- it's an obvious margin spread between your pre-sold homes as opposed to ones you started building and then sold them?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, on the inventory side, I think we've consistently said over time that we have a spec program where we try to maintain 1 to 2 per community across the country in every community. We have some that are starting construction, some of which is presold, some of which is a speculative unsold home. And what we do is, on each community -- at each community, we measure pace and price to figure out what our start program would be. And we haven't really adjusted that program in the market over the last several quarters, pretty consistent with what we've been doing.
Stuart A. Miller: Right. And with that, why don't we make this -- the next one the last question?
Operator: And our last question is coming from Susan Maklari of UBS.
Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: My first question is on the cancellation rate. Can you give us a little more detail into what caused the sequential increase that we saw? And then, are you comfortable with the current level? Or how should we think about the potential trends in that going forward?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, our cancellation rate has really been pretty modest. If you look historically, cancellation rates are generally around 20% and maybe even trending a little bit higher. We've always articulated and felt that not having that kind of level of cancellation rate means that our sales folks just aren't pushing or working hard enough. You're going to have a certain number of buyers that, for one reason or another, don't go forward. So our cancellation rate, at least by historical norms, is still relatively low. We're in the 18% range right now. So I wouldn't ascribe too much importance to that cancellation rate for the fluctuations around that range. Bruce, would you add to that?
Bruce E. Gross: No, no, I agree. I think you said it well. We've always said that normalized cancellation rate is around 20%. And when there was a buildup of inventory and we needed to monetize inventory in the downturn, it got up to much higher levels. But we would like to see the can rate be at a healthy level, closer to that 20% range, give or take a little bit.
Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. Perfect. And then, just one last question. You spoke to the fact that you're still able to offset the input cost increases that you're seeing with the home price appreciation that you're getting. If we get to a point where the home price depreciation falls somewhat from what we're seeing, can you talk about maybe potentially some of the things you can do to help offset those input prices and continue to maintain somewhat the margins that you're seeing now?
Bruce E. Gross: Okay. So as input prices are changing, again, we've been offsetting them with our price increases and with sales incentives coming down. And keeping in mind that our direct costs are 40% to 45% of the sales price, so they would have to go up twice as fast as any net benefit between the sales price improvement or the sales incentives coming down. So that's the main item that we see offsetting these costs as we go forward.
Stuart A. Miller: But additionally, we are primarily focused on our operating margin. And as our volumes continue to improve and as our efficiency continues to improve, we think that the net bottom line is also improving even as sales price starts to slow a little bit. All right. So we'll end it there. We would like to thank everybody for joining us for our third quarter update and look forward to reporting the fourth quarter. As Bruce said earlier, it will be the 3rd week of December, and we look forward to telling you more about the progress of the market and our company. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, very good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2013 update. We're very pleased to share our results to you this morning. We are here in our Southern California office, as we're here to host our Board of Directors meeting, and to have our board spend some time with our California management team and to see some of our product out here as well. In the context of our board meeting, let me take this opportunity to welcome our newest board member, Teri McClure. Teri brings a tremendous amount of background and experience to our board, as she is General Counsel for UPS, and you can read more about Teri's experience and history in the press release that we put out this morning. Now this morning, I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you've just heard from, who's our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here as well for our Q&A session. I'd like to begin this morning with some brief overview remarks on the overall state of the housing market recovery in the context of today's volatile market conditions, and then briefly overview our operations. Bruce, then, is going to, as usual, provide greater detail on our overall numbers, as well as some further comments on our Financial Services segment. And then as always, we'll open up for Q&A. As we have in the past, we request that during Q&A, each person limit themselves to one question and just one related follow-up. So let me begin. And to begin, let me state the obvious. Interest rates have moved higher and mortgage rates have moved from their unprecedented low point towards more normalized levels. And while this movement is not a surprise, given the improvement in economic conditions and in the housing market in general, it seems that the timing has caught the investor community off-guard and has shaken investor confidence in the overall housing recovery. Our view, though, is that the housing recovery is still very much intact and that the fundamentals of that recovery remain solid. The overriding driver of recovery in the housing market remains the underproduction of both single and multifamily product throughout the economic downturn and up to and including this year. Over the past 5 years of housing production, we've built an average of under 700,000 single and multifamily homes total per year, with an average obsolescence rate of approximately 300,000 per year. This compares to a need for new dwelling units per year of between 1.2 million and 1.5 million. This year, a significantly stronger year of building activity, we will produce approximately 950,000 single and multifamily dwellings, and again, will underserve the country's needs. We have more than absorbed the overbuilding of the early to mid-2000s, and have been underproducing for a protracted period of time. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the builders of both multi and single-family products have been pushing to increase production. The increase in production has been slow and difficult because of 2 factors. First, there's a shortage of entitled and developed land to build on and land prices have been moving higher. Secondly, the increased production has created labor shortages in many major markets. We hear of the labor shortage not just from the builders in the field, but also from the manufacturers and distributors that serve the industry. While these shortages add to the cost to build in the short term, they also fuel the longer-term prospects for housing, as employment drives confidence and the wage increases that lure workers off the sofa and back into the field to meet demand also enable more families to afford to purchase or rent. While production continues to lag the need, we are experiencing supply shortages against a growing demand. While some have argued that increased demand is being driven by low interest rates, we believe that it's being driven by a generally improving economy, driving household formation and a decoupling of households under one roof. New families are seeking to find independent shelter. Where attractive financing is available and obtainable, households seek for-sale product. But in the absence of a for-sale option, they seek rentals. But that just increases demand for rentals and drives up the rental rates, making for-sale monthly payments even more attractive. The bottom line is that there are too few dwellings for a growing population and for normalized household formation. Inventories are low for both new and existing homes, as well as for rentals. As demand increases, there are fewer homes or apartments to purchase or rent, and prices are being driven higher, as you can see in today's Case-Shiller results and today's new home sales beat. Distressed homes are being absorbed by the investor community and repurposed as rentals. In the short term, these rentals are helping to fill the void of the short supply of rentals for growing demand. The relationship between rental rates and for-sale monthly payments has favored homeownership for some time now. Even with interest rates edging upward to more normalized levels, the monthly payment math continues to push families to find a way to purchase, in order to lower their monthly payment, to increase their disposable income, and to stabilize their living expenses without annual repricing. And interest rates, though modestly higher, are still at historically low levels. Customer perception at this point remains that today's low interest rate still presents a unique opportunity to lock in a very low cost of capital, and this opportunity might not be available forever. At current interest rates, affordability remains at historically very high levels. Even with more significant movement in both interest rate and pricing, homes remain affordable by all measures, and will continue to remain attractive relative to rental options as well. Finally, while demand for homes has been constrained by an overly-restrictive mortgage market, which has limited access to homeownership with highly conservative underwriting criteria, the landscape is improving, as lenders are beginning to reconsider their credit underwriting overlays and open the doors for more -- to more approvals. While this process has been and continues to be slow to mature, we've come a long way since last year at this time, and we expect to see further easing of credit standards to normalized levels and further extension of credit to the market. As we've seen in the past week, there have been, and still are, economic and political uncertainties ahead that will affect and bring questions to the future of housing. We continue to feel that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for dwelling units. We believe we're still in the beginning stages of a recovery that will be sustained for several more years. Now turning to Lennar. Lennar has been, and continues to be, very well-positioned for recovery in housing. This is reflected in our second quarter 2013 results and in our positioning for the future. In our second quarter, new orders were up 27% over last year, and our dollar value of backlog is up over 76%, to its highest level in 5 years. Gross margins improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 24.1%, a 160-basis-point increase over last year. And operating margins increased 410 basis points to 13.3%, reflecting the powerful operating leverage in our absorption rate growth. For the full year 2013, we expect our average gross margin to continue to improve throughout the year. Margins continue to benefit from our aggressive land acquisition strategy, as well as higher home prices, lower incentives and operating leverage from greater absorption per community of approximately 4 per month now, which is a significant improvement over last year, and then, of course, from more sales as well. During the quarter, we continued our aggressive land acquisition program and closed on approximately 8,700 homesites for $450 million, and that land had basically been contracted between 1 and 2 years prior to its closing. Additionally, we spent approximately $122 million on bringing land to developed status, ready for production. Combined, our land acquisition and land spend is up about 100% year-over-year. Our average selling price for the second quarter was $282,500, a 13% increase over last year, which covered the increases in labor and material costs, and increased -- which increased approximately 8% over the prior year. Our Homebuilding operations have been improving due to a strong operating strategy, complemented by an excellent management team and management execution. Additionally, we opened 93 new communities and closed out 83 communities during the quarter, to end at 9 -- 492 active communities, a 12% year-over-year increase. Today, we are fortunate to have the land in-hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014 and as a result, we're pursuing land opportunities for 2015 and beyond. This is an enviable position in today's market, and is a position that was earned through our very strategic land acquisition program that began back in 2009. Complementing our Homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating earnings of $29 million compared to $18 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 79% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which it operates. Mortgage operations have also benefited from a robust refinancing market, which of course, is now starting to subside. Lennar home mortgages should continue to grow alongside our expanding Homebuilding business, as well as serve non-Lennar purchasers in a growing number of markets. While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating divisions are all maturing to be excellent longer-term value-creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to grow as a blue-chip capital investment management company and commercial real estate capital provider. While current earnings have slowed as we have shifted from balance sheet investment to a fund investment model, the prospects for future consistent earnings continue to improve. We have now invested or committed almost $1 billion of equity through Fund 1, and we are now harvesting those investments. Performance for the fund is already well ahead of original projections, and we started distributing capital back to investors and have returned almost 1/2 of the original investment. In addition, if we continue on our current performance path, we expect we will exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means that the carried interest to Rialto, as the manager of the fund, will exceed our expectations, and none of that potential value is reflected in our current earnings picture. Finally, in December, Fund #2 had its first closing of commitments of approximately $260 million, including $100 million from us. And in the second quarter, we closed an additional $260 million to bring the total in Fund 2 to $520 million closed, which is about halfway to our total goal. And we have already started investing that capital as well. Although the shorter-term earnings have slowed, we have morphed to a private equity program and our Rialto program is maturing. We are very excited about the long-term prospects for value creation from this program. Lennar multifamily, our apartment division, has now commenced construction on 5 apartment communities nationwide, totaling approximately 1,500 apartments and $225 million in development. And it's moving forward with a growing pipeline. We expect that rental will continue to thrive alongside the for-sale market, as many will not be able to access the for-sale market and rentals will meet their housing needs. Even with the step-up in apartment production nationally, additional product will be needed to meet the demand to fill the shortfall from prior years. Finally, FivePoint Communities is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium locations to the market, to fill the growing demand for well-located, approved and developed homesites. This quarter, we saw the first earnings contribution from this division, which will continue to contribute as additional land becomes entitled and developed over the next years. In conclusion, while we are aware of the concerns that are being reflected in current market volatility, it is our belief that the market remains positioned to continue to recover, and that our company is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit. The housing market is healing and recovery is accelerating as we produce shelter that is needed for a growing population and a return to more normal levels of household formation. As the housing market continues its overall trajectory back to normal, it is providing stimulus to the overall economy through job creation and building long-term consumer wealth, which, for generations, has been the benefit of homeownership. Lennar's Homebuilding machine is extremely well-positioned and continues to gain market share. We have excellent land positions in all of our major markets, while the land market, overall, is very constrained, and we have an excellent management team that will continue to be our primary driver of current earnings. Homebuilding, of course, is supported and enhanced by our Financial Services division, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance its bottom line. Rialto continues to expand its franchise and invest in high-yielding alternative investments, while supporting the homebuilder with access to off-market homesites. Our growing multifamily platform will continue to provide an additional long-term complementary growth opportunity for the company. And FivePoint, with its large long-term California land assets, could not be better positioned to reap the benefits of an appreciating land-constrained housing market. Although there continue to be political and economic headline risks, the primary drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. I am confident of Lennar's position today in the marketplace, and rest assured that our future growth is supported by a strong balance sheet with an exceptional group of leaders, who will be able to navigate through the challenges and towards the opportunities that lie ahead. With that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce E. Gross: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. Our net earnings for the second quarter were $0.61 per diluted share. If we excluded the reversal of the deferred tax valuation allowance in both years, and normalized the tax rate at 39%, the EPS comparison per diluted share would be $0.43 for the quarter versus $0.15 in the prior year. Revenues from home sales increased 58% in the second quarter, driven by a 39% increase in deliveries and a 13% year-over-year increase in ASP to $283,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: East region, $263,000, up 14%; Southeast Florida, $273,000, up 3%; Central, $257,000, up 12%; Houston, $253,000, up 10%; West Region, $321,000, up 5%; Other, $399,000, up 25%. The gross margins from our new communities purchased after 2008 continued to outperform the company average gross margin during the quarter, and they represented approximately 59% of the company's deliveries in Q2. Sales incentives were $20,200 per home delivered during the quarter, or 6.7% of home sales revenue. The sales incentives improved by 400 basis points or $9,600 per home delivered versus the prior year. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was highest in the East, Southeast Florida and West regions. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues from home sales, improved 230 basis points to 10.9%. And this is the incremental operating leverage that we've been discussing, primarily as our volume, and particularly, our absorption per community has been increasing. Again, our absorption per community this quarter was 4 sales per community per month. That's an increase over last year's 3.5 per community per month, and 2.9 in the first quarter of this year. This was the lowest SG&A percentage, as a percent of home sales, in the last 7 years. During the quarter, Stuart mentioned the El Toro joint venture sold their first homesites to homebuilders, including Lennar. Our 25% interest in the joint venture resulted in a $13 million profit on our joint venture line. Lennar purchased 3 of these communities that were sold by the venture, and the profit relating to the communities purchased by Lennar are deferred and recognized in our gross margin at the time that Lennar delivers the homes, which we expect to start in fiscal 2014. Turning to Financial Services. The second quarter improvement was again helped by the strong refinance environment, leading to higher volumes and higher profit per transaction. The mortgage pretax income increased to $26.1 million from $17.2 million in the prior year. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 45% to $1.4 billion. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers were 51% of the total originations this quarter. And again, that was helped out by the increase in the number of refinance transactions. Our title company had a good quarter as well. They had a $3.7 million profit during the quarter compared with $1.4 million in the prior year. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $2.8 million, compared to $4.3 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of Rialto's $2.8 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: the Rialto real estate funds contributed $4.4 million of earnings; the FDIC and wholly-owned bank portfolios contributed a net of $4.5 million of earnings; and these amounts were reduced by $6.1 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $9 million. The prior year amount included $2.7 million of earnings from PPIP, which was successfully completed in the prior year. At quarter end, the FDIC debt net of cash available in the defeasance [ph] account and in Rialto's cash account was down to $48 million. We expect this debt to be paid off around year end, and then there will be more significant cash flow generated back to the parent. During the quarter, we reversed approximately $41 million of the remaining tax asset reserve, all of which pertains to state taxes. This was the remaining reserve we expected to reverse this year, and going forward, we expect an effective rate of 39%. Turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet liquidity remained strong in the quarter, at $728 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. In June, this facility was increased to $950 million, and the maturity extended to June of 2017. During the quarter, we issued an additional $50 million to our $525 million of 4.750% notes due 2022. And in the last 4 quarters, we have now issued a total of $1.2 billion of long-term senior notes, with an average coupon of 4.6%. I wanted to summarize what was said on this call and highlight a few items, additionally, for the remainder of 2013. Number one, we have noted an increase in our cycle time and have generated a high percentage of pre-sales during the spring selling season, and as a result, we expect our backlog conversion ratio to be between 75% and 80% for the third quarter. Although the backlog conversion is declining in the third quarter, we are well-positioned with our backlog and expect to deliver between 18,250 and 18,500 homes for all of 2013. As Stuart highlighted, our gross margin is increasing throughout the year. And with the strength of our backlog, it gives us confidence to increase our gross margin guidance to approximately 24.25% for Q3 and 24.75% for Q4. For a couple of quarters, we have highlighted that we expect the number of refinanced transactions will slow as we progress through the year, and the profit per transaction in our mortgage business is likely to moderate a little bit. Additionally, we are required to book profit on our mortgage originations at the time that we lock the loan. As a result, the profit for Financial Services is higher in the spring selling season, and we expect that profit in Financial Services will be sequentially lower, both in Q3 and Q4. As highlighted on the call, Rialto is in a transitional year, and we expect Rialto's profitability to continue to be backloaded to the fourth quarter of 2013. With that, let me open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, LLC: It's actually Alan on for Ivy. The first question I had just relates to kind of your stock performance year-to-date, which has underperformed despite, obviously, the very strong performance in your Homebuilding business. And we've heard from some clients just general concerns or questions about your expansion into some of the other ancillary businesses, such as apartments and obviously, the Rialto business, which the profitability has declined here a little bit. I was hoping you might be able to just put the rising rates -- put some perspective behind that on the impact on those ancillary pieces of your business, and obviously, in Rialto specifically, given the high-yield investments there, if you would expect to see any impact on future profitability from higher rates?
Stuart A. Miller: Wow. That's a lot of questions in one, Alan. But let me see if I can attack that. First of all, as it relates to stock performance, as a management team, we're highly focused on operational performance in the company, and the investor community is going to have to interpret things as they might. We, of course, have pretty much gotten out ahead of the rest of the market in terms of land acquisition and -- okay, so let me just continue. So we've gotten out ahead in terms of land acquisition and margin enhancement, and we've had pretty strong margin growth early on in the recovery cycle. So we've enjoyed, I think, a pretty good program relative to our position within the industry and our stock price as well. Perhaps that subsides it [ph] a little bit. I'm not really sure and, of course, interest rates have kind of altered the landscape for the entire industry, at least over the short term. As it relates to our fundamental business, we've said consistently, our primary driver is and continues to be our Homebuilding operation. We are extremely well-positioned from a land standpoint. We're well-positioned in terms of margin generation, and our management team really is hitting on all cylinders. With that said, our ancillary businesses are really well-positioned for future growth and for future contribution. Frankly, I have not been more excited than I am today about the prospects for Rialto, and as well, the prospects for our multifamily, even given the increase in interest rate that we've seen and the changing environment. Rialto has morphed from an on-balance sheet to a private equity model. In doing so, you're seeing fewer earnings flow through to the bottom line right now. That will change over time as our press starts to be brought into earnings in the future. But as it relates to our Fund 1 performance, it has been nothing short of exceptional, and Fund 2, monies are already starting to be invested. We are providing capital for commercial real estate financings and other positions within capital stack [ph] . We think that this is business is going to continue to grow, and is going to be a very exciting part of our story going forward. As far as the rental apartment properties division is concerned, we have a growing pipeline, growing from $1.5 billion to $2 billion in properties that are going to be coming online. As I noted in my opening comments, we have 5 properties under construction. And I think in the context of a market that is short on dwelling units overall, people are going to be looking to purchase because the monthly payment is lower, if you're able to purchase. But if not, there's a growing demand for rentals, and we think that rental rates are going to continue to be pushed up higher. So even with interest rates going up, we feel pretty comfortable about the rental community development as well.
Richard Beckwitt: I guess the only thing I'd add, too, is all the time we've been expensing startup costs associated with these businesses and our pretax income has doubled on a year-over-year basis, and our margins are up on a year-over-year basis. So I think we've been a good steward of the capital.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: Okay, Rick, I appreciate that, and sorry I jumped on late. You guys couldn't hear me, I was muted. But I think that Stuart, as the most senior tenured leader of the industry, I think people would really appreciate maybe a little bit more specifics on your view of the backup in rates. I know you said that -- you commented that we have a lot of room to go. But what rate starts to get you nervous? And I recognize you can't really think about rates in isolation, so can you give us your more elaborate sort of expectations on what really starts to make a difference from the consumers' affordability?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, Ivy, the first thing that I'd say is that rates have been at historically low levels. They're reverting, and maybe they're actually starting a movement, or maybe it will ebb and flow a little bit. But they're going to ultimately revert to more normalized levels. Now, but you can't look at the interest rate in isolation. We have to be looking at interest rate in the context in which they're moving, which means an improving economy, an improving employment picture. We are seeing labor shortages across the country, not just for the homebuilders and people in the field, but for manufacturers and distributors. We're hearing from all of those people that, not only are there labor shortages, but wages are moving up in order to get people off the sofa and back into the field. And this portends good things for demand for housing, both on the for-sale and the rental side. Interest rates that are moving higher in the context of economic improvement, employment improvement, at the same time, really reflects a healthy economy and a healthy movement. And for housing, in general, has historically meant that housing is going to thrive, as more people are able to afford to buy or to rent and to match-up with the supply that is available. And of course, right now, we're looking at a supply shortage, so that means that even in the context of rising rates and a better economy, we're likely to see price increases and rental increases as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask on Homebuilding SG&A. I think last quarter, you provided some sequential comparisons and expectations for the rest of the year. I think given the step function down this quarter, would you be comfortable providing any expectations for the rest of this year on that line item?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure, Jade. This is Bruce. I think as you look at the next quarter, I would expect a similar type of SG&A percentage as we had this quarter, and a little bit more leverage as we go into the fourth quarter, as we expect to have more deliveries in Q4. So we'll see what that percentage is. But figure flat next quarter, and a little bit of improvement going into Q4.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Regarding Rialto, is there a way we can think about the value of the carried interest benefit that you could receive? And have your -- are your comments meant to suggest that this could be a 4Q event? Or would that be next year?
Stuart A. Miller: I think I'd be looking to next year, and we haven't given guidance on the magnitude of the carried interest. But we are becoming more enthusiastic about our prospects in all of our fund investing. And I think that we'll have to ask for you to be patient, until we have better clarity to bring to the market.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And finally, the pick up or the -- reportedly Rialto has begun conduit operations or is in talks regarding that, I think you alluded to that in your commentary. Should we expect all of those lending programs to flow through the private equity funds rather than through the wholly-owned subsidiary earnings?
Stuart A. Miller: A lot of the capital activities will be wholly-owned. So it will be -- some of that will be split between the private equity and the on-balance sheet. But the operations that are kind of the natural evolution of that business, the conduit activities, the origination side, is generally on-balance sheet. The purchase of securities and special servicing is going to flow more through the private equity, so it's kind of split.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I had a couple of questions for you. One, I guess the question we're getting a lot from investors relates to the impact of rising interest rates on your business and obviously, you've done a good job here of addressing the fact that you really haven't seen that yet. Implicitly, it would seem that if you have not -- if you're not anticipating seeing, let's say, a 100 basis-point rise that we've almost absorbed, affecting demand, implicitly what you're saying is that the buyers who have been buying over the last year have not been maximizing their purchase -- purchasing power and therefore, are able to absorb somewhat higher rates, and still make a decision to buy, essentially, the same unit and the same price that they would have bought, let's say, 6 months ago or prior to the higher rates. My observation is that that's probably true because the lending standards are much more difficult right now, and so if you can actually get a mortgage, you're probably a solid-enough citizen with a solid-enough balance sheet that you're probably being relatively prudent. But I'd love to hear your particular view on whether or not your buyer, over the last 6 months, has been able to buy more than they have been buying and therefore, can tolerate a higher rate environment?
Richard Beckwitt: It's Rick. As we were coming out of the downturn and people were trying to get a sense of footing of where the economy was going, I think they didn't put everything they could into the home. They left a little bit on the table. They wanted to feel and see the economy improving. And we've seen, over the last 12 months, incremental changes in the type of spec level that we've been putting in our homes, given the fact that people have a little bit more appetite and purchasing power today than they had a year ago. But the other thing that sometimes gets skewed as you look at it from a lofty level, is that it's a different mix of buyers every day out there. And while we try to draw some comparisons on a trend line, it's real difficult to do because you have different groups of people, different products at any point in time that are for sale. But generally speaking, you're correct. There is increased purchasing power today, notwithstanding the fact that people had that muscle before.
Stuart A. Miller: Let me just add to that and say that there are a lot of different stories out there. I think in part, there has been a more conservative approach to using all of the buying power, as Rick just described. But additionally, this decoupling that is going on, people having been 2 generations under one roof during the downturn, and unwinding that has really enabled the generation that's moving out and finding its own new shelter to save money, to reposition their credit, and to be positioned to be able to purchase. That new entrant into the marketplace, or reentrant into the marketplace, as the case may be, is positioned to be able to make a lot of choices because they've saved some money and they've gotten their credit history in good position to be able to afford something. And the important thing right now, Steve, is the relationship between monthly payments in for-sale relative to monthly payments for rent, is really a driver and very compelling for people to find a way to afford as much as possible on the for-sale side.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. That's very helpful. My second question relates to your land spend activity. I think you did a good job of talking about the fact that you have a very strong land pipeline, and you've done a lot of things when times were bad, so that you don't really have to force anything now that times are getting better. I wanted to ask you, though, if you could help us understand what you would likely do differently in the near term, if, over the course of the next few months, God forbid, you did see something happening out in the field that was markedly worse, if the environment got markedly worse and you saw that in your selling communities, what would be the likely response in terms of your land spend activity? And I'm really trying to frame sort of how much of your land spend, that you've been doing and that you're expecting to do here over the remainder of the year, is for communities that you don't really need, in other words, like 2015, 2016 versus stuff that you actually kind of need to open in various markets in the next year or 2?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, Steve, It's Rick. As we've shared with you before, and Steve -- and Stuart highlighted on the call earlier, we've been way ahead here. I can tell you that while we're continuing to look for opportunities where we can feather in some things for the balance of 2013 if they fall in our lap, or early 2014, mid-2014, the lion's share of what we're looking for is 2015 and 2016. So with that said, a dramatic shift in the land environment, for us, would possibly be a good thing because it would create some turmoil out there in the market. From a general perspective, as we're looking at those type of opportunities, given the long runway that has to happen through entitlement or processing, and zoning, and those type of things, the values for those assets are still incredibly wholesale opportunities. So we probably wouldn't approach it in a different way, we might be a little bit more cautious. But given that's where we're looking, it wouldn't dramatically change what we're doing.
Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Are you buying those or are you optioning those kinds of properties out to 2015 and '16?
Richard Beckwitt: More often than not, what we're doing is we're working with the owner of the land, putting it under contract, giving them a small amount of earnest money, and helping them with the entitlement process by using our intellectual capital and expertise with the cities as currency.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen East of ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I don't know if this is for Stuart or Rick. But if you look at your markets, when you think about higher rates and lower affordability, what would be the top 2 or 3 markets that you think are most susceptible to having problems with the higher rates? And which markets do you think would be in the best shape?
Stuart A. Miller: I think, Stephen, pretty much across-the-board, affordability right now is at a place where the markets are going to -- look, we all recognize that there isn't a national housing market and each market is local and unique unto itself. But I think that affordability is in such a comfortable place right now, that when you ask about market susceptibility to interest rate movement, if you're in a range of moderate increases in interest rates, as we have seen, I think that all markets, pretty much across-the-board, are going to continue to be reasonably strong. So I wouldn't differentiate the markets unless you saw some kind of violent move in interest rates, which I'm just not projecting at this point.
Richard Beckwitt: Steve, it's Rick. I think it's more of a price-point issue as opposed to a market issue. I think when you get down into that sub-120 price point, if there is interest rate moves or confidence issues, then that business starts to get a little bit more difficult. Similarly, although most people would say that at the high-end of the market, those buyers don't necessarily need a mortgage, they're sophisticated buyers and they're getting one. And a movement in interest rate tends to, after time, affect the very high end. Given the fact that we're a first-time, move-up, middle-market, and some of our things are sort of second-time move-up, we think that we're pretty well insulated, to a large degree, from interest rate movements in the market.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful to me. And then if you look at El Toro, you had some nice community sales this quarter. As we look out over the next -- the rest of this year and '14, can you talk about -- give us some timelines so we can understand how we sort of forecast these businesses unwinding, not only El Toro, but some of your other parcels that you have in California?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Yes, Stephen, it's Jon. El Toro should see its next delivery homesites in 2014, about a year out from this first group that was just delivered. It would be a similar size, perhaps a little bit larger. What we just closed recently was about 725 homesites, and you should see an offering about once a year coming out of El Toro. In San Francisco, we just broke ground this month at Hunters Point, with product -- that product is being built within the venture, and you should see actual home deliveries from that in about 14 to 18 months.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: All right. And just one last question, you talked about 59% of your delivery sort of from your new communities. Can you remind us what the differential was on gross margin? And whether you're still seeing that consistency, new versus old legacy land?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure, Steve, it's Bruce. We're still seeing approximately 200-basis-point increase in gross margins from the new communities we've purchased since 2008. Now the legacy communities are still doing well from a gross margin perspective, but the new communities are about 200 bps higher.
Operator: Our next question is from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I wanted to follow-up actually on Stephen East's question and Rick's response, which I thought was a really interesting and good response on the buyer segment and price point, and how rates affect different buyer segments. And I'm going to ask a question, I don't know if it's answerable, but I'll give it my best shot, which is, when you think about that sub-120 price point, how important is that to the overall recovery of the housing market long-term when we think about past peaks and we think about getting margins -- excuse me, volumes back to starts, or new home sales back to where we were? And how important was that for Lennar in the last cycle? And kind of how important do you envision it as you go through this cycle?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, as far as how important it is for the industry, I think it's a function of 2 things. One is what employment growth is going to be, to a large degree, people buying that -- and whether it's sub-120, I used that as a number, it could be sub-110, that's probably a better number. There's people that buy. I think it has more of an impact on the resale market than on the new home market, because people will be not able to buy some of that product because there is less of a new construction market in that sub-120, 110 market. We're not really in that market except for a couple of divisions that offer some product like that. Bruce, you want -- or Stuart, talk about how this affected Lennar in the past cycles?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. As Rick said, our -- primarily, what we're delivering is in the middle market. So as you're dealing with those people who are just trying to enter the market for the first time, that really didn't have a big impact on our business. And as you look at markets like California, which tend to do very well on the upswing, the big price movements, you're not in that price point anyway, even in the Central Valley. You're starting in the mid-2s to $300,000 price points.
Richard Beckwitt: And David, one other thing I'd say is this may be a different set of cards this time. And the reason I'd say that is there was such deferred purchasing. You're seeing an older group of first-time buyers coming into the market that may have double income associated with that. So I'm not sure you can truly draw parallels to what happened in the past, although I'm sure that someone can.
Stuart A. Miller: I just want to say, David, I think you might have gotten it right in the beginning when you said this question might not be answerable. I think at the end of the day, this is a new environment. We're going to have to wait and see how it unfolds in terms of -- every part of the market kind of interacts with other parts of the market. The move-up buyer historically has been selling a home to a first-time buyer in order to move up. Right now, the move-up buyer is coming out of mom and dad's home or a coupled environment. So we have a new evolution this time around. I think that one of the other defining components of this particular market recovery is the fact that we are dealing with a housing shortage overall, both on the rental side and on the single-family side. And so some that might be move-ups have to look at rentals, but rental rate is high, so instead they go for something that's smaller in nature and more affordable. It's going to be interesting to see how it evolves, and I don't think there's a clear answer.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just one other quick question. Stuart, you mentioned in the prepared comments that you're seeing some easing on the credit standards side. Maybe you can talk about is that additional liquidity, more players, some of the more traditional, big correspondent lenders coming back to the market? Is it actually showing up in standards? Or is it just additional liquidity that you're seeing coming back?
Stuart A. Miller: I was watching CNBC as the CEO of LendingTree was talking yesterday, and I watched him struggle with some of the same questions. It's hard to put your finger on exactly where the loosening is taking place. I don't know if the customer is coming to the table better prepared with more down payment and more documentation, or if it's the lenders that are really opening the doors a little bit. But it's at the margins, and it's hard to identify exactly where the loosening is taking place, but it is. More people are getting approved, more people are finding their way to mortgage approval, and I think it's a trend that we're going to continue to see. Appraisals are clearly loosening up as part of the process as well. So I think the important thing to do is to look backwards a year or 1.5 years. And if you look backwards, you see we've come quite a long way in terms of people finding access to the mortgage markets. I think, as we look to next week and next month, it's hard to see where those incremental moves are going to come from. But I think a year from now, we're going to continue to see loosening and reversion to normal underwriting standards as markets, the financial markets, governmental markets, become more and more comfortable with an improving and recovering housing market overall. I think the overlays are just going to dissipate very -- at the margins.
Bruce E. Gross: One other thing I'd add to that, David, is one area that we are seeing some improvement is with the mortgage insurers. So there's a greater percentage of mortgage insurers coming back in, and that's allowing somebody that previously was going for a 20% down with a conventional mortgage, you're now seeing the ability to have lower down payments, and we see that that's likely to increase even further as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question is from Desi DiPierro of RBC.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: On the labor and material side, you said it was up 8% in the quarter. In recent months, have you seen in a slowdown in the rate of increase, or even a decline in material prices, given lower lumber and OSB prices?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. For example, lumber has just come down recently, but the way that the pricing works is that will affect our starts in this quarter and our deliveries into the fourth quarter and first quarter. So you'll see a trend up until those deliveries hit. Other products have been relatively flat. Of course, some commodities are down, like copper. So on one side, you have pressure from labor, that's pushing cost up. And then on the materials side, things tend to be plus or minus flat, with the exception of lumber, as I just mentioned, which came down for panels about 25% and dimensional lumber about 15%.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And then just looking at Financial Services, I know you said that operating income would be lower sequentially due to the seasonality. And so I also wanted to see if you, in addition to lower volumes, are you seeing a change in the spread on the mortgages that you're originating when you go to sell them as well, given the results [ph] ?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. Spreads have been at high levels compared to historical norms. So we're expecting that, that will be the case as we go into the second half of this year. We haven't seen a lot of that yet, but the expectation should be that, that will be moderate as we go through the rest of 2013.
Operator: That is all the time we have for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Stuart for closing remarks.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay. Well listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us. As you can see, we're pretty enthusiastic about our positioning as it relates to the future, and we feel pretty strongly that the housing recovery is intact and likely to continue for some time to come. Thanks for joining us, and we'll report back at the end of next quarter.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phones at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter 2013 update. We're pleased to share our results this morning. I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Dave Collins, who you just heard from, our Controller; and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of Rialto, are here with us here as well. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is available by phone for the Q&A session. We also have with us Eric Feder, who has been a bridge for deals within the company, and today is his birthday, so we asked him to join us for the conference call today. So happy birthday, Eric. I'd like to begin this morning with some remarks on the overall state of the housing market recovery and then briefly overview our operation. Bruce is then going to provide some detail on our Financial Services segment as well as some additional color on our overall numbers. And as always, we'll open it up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] So to begin, let me make 4 macro points about the housing market recovery. First, housing is recovering, and the recovery is consistent, healthy and growing stronger. We saw from yesterday's housing starts and permits numbers that the recovery in housing is continuing to progress in both multifamily and single-family products. This data confirms what we've seen in the field for some time. There has been an underproduction of housing during the downturn, as we produced as few as 550,000 homes per year during the downturn of both multi- and for-sale product. This is very close to the rate at which homes become obsolete. So for some of those years, we had essentially no net production against the normalized household formation rate of some 1.25 million annually. This shortfall will have to be made up, and the market is beginning to move in that direction. Second point, national numbers continue to be tricky to interpret. On Monday, the U.S. homebuilder confidence number showed a decline, which suggested that the recovery might be stalling or might not be as robust as expected. Against that backdrop, yesterday's numbers confirmed continued recovery. In our view, the conflict in the information rests in the fact that the homebuilder confidence survey is primarily a polling of smaller private builders. Their lowered confidence reflects their limited access to capital and, in turn, a limited access to land. The larger builders have had access to capital and land while the market was depressed. And since then, land prices have moved significantly. Late participants in the land market are having difficulty participating in the market recovery and are not able to solve to acceptable margins in their underwriting. The lack of builder confidence against the backdrop of increased starts and permits supports our thesis that larger builders will increase market share while also participating in the broader market recovery. Land positions owned in the context of housing recovery is driving homebuilder confidence. I suspect that a builder confidence survey of the larger, well-capitalized builders would reveal substantially higher confidence. Third point, the recovery is based on strong market fundamentals. Low interest rates and relatively low home prices continue to produce low monthly payment rates, which compare favorably with local rental rates. Not only is for-sale housing extremely affordable, but it is a preferred and more stable alternative to rentals, which reprice every 12 months. Inventories are low for both new and existing homes as demand increases, there are fewer homes to purchase and prices are being driven higher. Distressed homes are being absorbed by the investor community and repurposed as rentals. While these homes are primarily in secondary and outer fringe locations, they would not compete with new product anyway, and they're being taken out of the for-sale pool as the market rebuilds. In the short term, these rental homes are helping to fill the void of the short supply of rentals for a growing demand. In the longer term, as these homes are put back on the market, they will likely be purchased by the renters that are in them as they find that they can qualify for homeownership. We do not view this as a looming inventory problem. Finally, resurgent demand for homes is constrained by the mortgage market currently, which has constrained demand with an overly restrictive underwriting criteria. Slowly, however, the landscape is improving as banks are beginning to reconsider their credit underwriting overlays and open the doors to more approvals. While this process has been and continues to be slow to mature, we've come a long way since last year at this time, and we expect to see further definition of the regulatory environment leading to a further extension of credit to the market. While there have been and still are economic and political uncertainties ahead, we feel that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for housing. We believe we are still in the beginning stages of a recovery that will be sustained for several more years. Now turning to Lennar. Lennar has been and continues to be very well positioned for the current recovery in housing. This is reflected in our first quarter 2013 results and in our positioning for the future. In our first quarter, new orders were up 34% over last year, and our dollar value of backlog is up over 100% to the highest levels it's been in 5 years. Gross margins improved year-over-year to an industry-leading 22.1%, a 120-point -- basis point increase over last year. And operating margins increased 410 basis points to 10.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our absorption growth. For the full year 2012, we expect our average gross margin to be between 23% and 24%. Margins continue to benefit from our proactive land acquisition strategy as well as higher home prices, lower incentives and operating leverage from greater absorption community of 3 per month, which is a 20% improvement over last year, and then, of course, from more sales overall. Our average selling price for the fourth quarter was $269,000, a 9% increase over last year, which covered the increases in labor and material costs, which increased approximately 4%. Our homebuilding operations have been improving due to a strong operating strategy complemented by excellent management execution. Additionally, we opened 80 new communities and closed out 55 communities during the quarter to end at 484 active communities, a 14% year-over-year increase. We continue to expect our year-end community count to be approximately 550 communities as our land acquisition strategy drives our growth. Today, we are fortunate to have the land in hand to meet our projected deliveries through 2014. As a result, we are primarily pursuing land opportunities for 2015 and beyond. This is an enviable position in today's market, a position that was earned through a very strategic land acquisition program that began in 2009. This program has put us several steps ahead of the competition and allows us to fish in a different pond. We're using our balance sheet to tie up land opportunities that will produce strong margins for years to come. Many of those assets are large-scale multiyear flagship development deals. Rialto has continued to play a very big part in our land program, and I want to thank the team for their hard work and dedication. Complementing our homebuilding operations, our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter with operating earnings of $16.1 million compared to $8.3 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 79% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which it operates. Mortgage operations have also benefited from a robust financing market. Lennar home mortgages should continue to grow alongside our expanding Homebuilding business as well as serve non-Lennar purchasers in selected markets. While our Homebuilding and Financial Services divisions are the primary drivers of near-term revenues and earnings, our 3 additional operating divisions are all maturing to be excellent longer-term value creation platforms for the company. Rialto continues to grow as a blue-chip private capital investment management company. While current earnings have slowed as we have shifted from balance sheet investment to a fund investment model, the prospects for future consistent earnings continue to improve. We've now invested or committed almost $1 billion of equity in Fund 1. Performance for the fund is already well ahead of original projections, and subsequent to year end, we started distributing capital back to investors. In addition, if we continue on this performance path, we expect to well exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means carried interest with an oar to Rialto as the manager of the fund. None of that potential value is reflected in our current earnings picture. Finally, in December, Fund #2 had its first closing of commitments of approximately $260 million, including $100 million from us, and we've already started investing that capital. Lennar multi-family, our apartment division, commenced construction on an additional 2 communities in the quarter and now has 4 communities under construction nationwide with a growing pipeline. And FivePoint Communities is quickly moving to bring developed land in premium locations to the market to fill the growing demand for well-located approved and developed homesites. In conclusion, as I reflect on the current positioning of Lennar and the state of the current housing recovery, I could not be more optimistic about our future. The housing market is healing and recovery is accelerating as we produce shelter that is needed for a growing population and a return to normal levels of household formation. As the housing market continues its overall trajectory back to normal, it will provide stimulus to the overall economy through job creation and building long-term consumer wealth, which for generations has been a benefit of homeownership. Our homebuilding machine is extremely well positioned and continues to gain market share. We have excellent land position in a constrained land market, and we have an excellent management team that will continue to be our primary driver of current earnings. Homebuilding is supported and enhanced by Financial Services, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance its bottom line. Rialto continues to expand its franchise and invest in high-yielding alternative assets while supporting the homebuilder with access to off-market homesites. Our growing multi-family platform provides an additional long-term and complementary growth opportunity for the company. And finally, FivePoint, with its large long-term California land assets, simply couldn't be better positioned to reap the benefits of an appreciating land-constrained housing market. Although there will be political and economic headline risk, the drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. I am confident of Lennar's position in today's marketplace and rest assured that our future growth is supported by a strong balance sheet with an exceptional group of leaders who will be able to navigate through the challenges and towards the opportunities of 2013. And with that, let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce E. Gross: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. I'll provide additional colors to the numbers, starting with the homebuilding segment. Revenues from home sales increased 40% in the first quarter, which was driven by a 28% increase in deliveries and a 9% increase year-over-year in average sales price to $269,000. The increase in deliveries resulted in a 79% backlog conversion ratio, which exceeded the 75% expectation given on our fourth quarter conference call. The average sales price by region is as follows: The East region was $251,000, up 13%. The Southeast Florida region was $271,000, up 2%. The Central region was $258,000, up 17%. Houston was up 12% to $258,000. The West region was $294,000. This was down 7%, but that was due to product mix. And then the other region was $339,000, down 6%. Our gross margin on home sales was 22.1%, and that compared with 20.9% in the prior year, an improvement of 120 basis points. The gross margins from our new communities purchased since 2008 continue to outperform the company average gross margin during the quarter, and they represented 57% of the company's deliveries in the first quarter. Sales incentives were $23,300 per home, and that was 8% as a percentage of home sales revenue. The sales incentives improved by 420 basis points or $10,900 for home delivered versus the prior year. The gross margin percentage for the quarter was highest in the East and Southeast Florida regions. However, this quarter's results had an increased product mix coming from the Central and other regions, where the gross margin percentage is lower than the company average. As we highlighted on our fourth quarter conference call, there is seasonality in our gross margins, and it tends to be lower in the first quarter and then typically increases throughout the year. This is due to lower closings in the first quarter, as well as higher field cost due to preparing to open more communities as well as winter-related costs in our communities. Our SG&A percent increased -- improved by 290 basis points to 12% this quarter. This is the incremental operating leverage that we have been discussing for some time as our volume and particularly our absorption per community increases. Through the downturn, we transformed the entire company to be on our Everything's Included platform, and we eliminated our design studio divisions remaining from the U.S. home acquisition. This move allowed us to eliminate multiple divisions in the same markets. And as a result, the number of homebuilding divisions has been reduced from 124 divisions at the peak in 2006 to 29 today. This is resulting in significant operating leverage on our G&A line. Additionally, we have focused heavily on using social media to attract our homebuyers, which has significantly reduced our advertising costs. With the improvement in both gross margin and SG&A, our operating margins, as Stuart mentioned, improved by 410 basis points to 10.1%. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 9,400 homesites, totaling $472 million, and we invested $120 million in land development. Our homesites owned and controlled now total 135,000 homesites. Turning to Financial Services. Mortgage pretax income increased to $16.4 million from $8.9 million in the prior year. The first quarter improvement was again helped by the strong refinance environment leading to higher volumes and higher profit per transaction. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 60% to $1.2 billion, and originations with non-Lennar homebuyers were 58% of total originations this quarter. Again, that was primarily driven by a robust refinance market. Our title company had a $300,000 profit in the quarter compared with a $100,000 loss in the prior year. Turning to our Rialto business segment. They generated operating earnings of $1.7 million during the quarter compared to $9.4 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of Rialto's $1.7 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: The first Rialto real estate fund contributed $6.4 million of earnings. The FDIC and wholly-owned bank portfolios contributed a net of $300,000 of earnings. And these amounts were reduced by approximately $5 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $6.3 million. At quarter end, the FDIC debt, net of cash available in the defeasance account and in Rialto's cash account, was only $99 million. We expect this debt to be paid off this year, and then there will be significant cash flow generation back to the parent. This quarter, we reversed approximately $25 million of the remaining deferred tax asset reserve, all of which pertains to state taxes. We expect reversing another $30 million to $40 million this year if our earnings trend continues. Turning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity remained strong during the quarter, with $1.1 billion of cash on hand and no outstanding borrowings under our $525 million credit facility. We continued our balance sheet strategy of pushing out debt maturities while driving down cost of capital as we raised $275 million of 4.125% 6-year senior notes and $175 million of 4.750% 10-year senior notes during the first quarter. We received a ratings upgrade from S&P to BB- during the quarter, and our net debt to total capital improved by 30 basis points year-over-year to 49.3%. To recap what was said on this call and highlight a few additional items for future quarters in 2013, I'm going to list a few areas, starting with active community count. Stuart mentioned that we are on track to be at 550 for the end of 2013. I wanted to remind people that there's a heavier concentration opening in the second half of the year. We expect our backlog conversion ratio to be between 85% and 90% for the second and third quarters and then should increase to between 90% and 100% in the fourth quarter. We expect to continue to see a positive gross margin trend during the year, increasing from last year's average of 22.7% for the whole year to between 23% and 24% as an average for 2013, with the typical seasonality throughout the year. We expect to see about 100 basis points year-over-year improvement in SG&A percentage in each of the next 3 quarters remaining in 2013. Financial Services. We do expect that the number of refinanced transactions will slow as we progress through the year, and the profit per transaction, which is at very high levels right now, will moderate as we go through the remainder of the year. As highlighted on the call, Rialto is in a transitional period as the PPIP investment was successfully completed last year and the second real estate fund will be ramping up throughout the year, so Rialto's profitability is expected to be backloaded in 2013. Excluding the impact from additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversals, we expect to have an effective tax rate going forward of approximately 39%. We're very well positioned, as we start our second quarter, with the strong backlog dollar value that Stuart mentioned and the favorable industry dynamics as well. So with that, let me turn it over to the operator, and we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.
Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Actually, this is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I was wondering if you could go over your philosophy on order pace versus price and what you're focusing on now as we move through the year.
Richard Beckwitt: It's Rick Beckwitt. It's a delicate balance in the field. We are reviewing pricing weekly in every community across the country. We have been increasing prices probably every couple of weeks in some communities, at least once a month in all communities. And we balanced the pace-price split really on a local basis. Our preference is to increase price over pace, particularly in communities where we have a long position, a lot of homesites to close out ahead of us. And to the extent that we're on the back end of the community, we may move through that community without too much price increase because of the incremental overhead associated with the fewer deliveries.
Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And you spent $500 million on land. What's your target for this year?
Bruce E. Gross: I think that you could probably count on about $500 million a quarter.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I appreciate your comments at the beginning, Stuart, where you mentioned, in terms of some macro comments, that you believe the housing recovery is actually growing stronger and that credit also is slowly improving. I was wondering if you could give -- certainly, your own trends are improving quarter-to-quarter, particularly in terms of price, and the comments that Rick gave are very helpful. Are there any areas of specificity or granularity, particularly as it relates to the market growing stronger? It kind of almost points to acceleration, and I think that kind of belies some of the optimism, particularly around pricing, that you shared with us when we met with the last month.
Stuart A. Miller: Well, I think, Mike, that -- I think that when we look backwards, what we have generally seen is that the trends that start to reveal themselves in the national numbers and come through performance reports are things that we start to see and feel in the field early. It's tough to be granular about these things. It's more about traffic, quality of traffic and the conversations at the field level that you're having with customers. I've noted that this recovery is starting to feel fundamentally driven and fundamentally sound, and it's primarily because the communications in the field are about people thinking about their monthly payment as it compares to rental rates, their monthly payment as it compares to stability and disposable income. And this is a real shift from people just kind of saying, "Hey, I want to own a home." It's about nickels, dollars and dimes and making sure that they're managing their life as well as possible. We are seeing that demand is growing. It is somewhat constrained by the smaller funnel of mortgage approvals. And so we're seeing not as much demand come through the numbers as demand is out there. And the constraint of the mortgage approval process is really keeping the recovery more sedate than it feels like it wants to be. And again, this is somewhat of a feeling from the field. Now looking at the mortgage approval process, it feels like it's fairly static when we think about it in kind of real-time sense. But if we go back a year or we go back 2 years, the mortgage approval process has really liberalized itself quite a bit. It was just a couple of years ago that it was virtually impossible to make your way through the maze of the paperwork and verifications that were required to get a mortgage. And though those might not be hard credit statistics, those impediments were just as severe as a 780 FICO score. People didn't want to go through the morass of trying to get a mortgage. Today, it is a more streamlined process. The buyer is educated as to what their down payment, their FICO scores, their credit status have to be in order to get approved, and they're coming in more prepared. Mortgage money is becoming marginally more available, and I think that trend will continue as we start to get legislative and regulatory certainty injected into the banking system; the overlays will start to dissipate a little bit.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great, I appreciate that. I guess, the second question, on the Rialto business. I believe you said that -- in the release that there was a $7 million impairment. Just wanted to get a sense of what that share was for Lennar's consolidated in terms of your pro rata share, how that affected profitability. And the real estate fund, $6.4 million contribution as well, is that something that we can assume will kind of continue in that rate? Or is it going to be kind of lumpy or maybe grow modestly? How should we think about that?
Bruce E. Gross: Okay. Let me start, Mike, with your first question, the impairment of $7 million that was noted in the release. 40% of that is ours. That's our share in the FDIC transaction. And that's really based on, as we look at our cash flows, it's more of a timing issue. As we pushed out the timing of some of the resolution of the assets, that resulted in a little bit of an impairment. So in our numbers, it's 40% of that $7 million. On the real estate fund question, each quarter, we go through a fair value analysis. The real estate Fund #1 is doing exceedingly well. And as Stuart talked about there being a significant carried interest that will mirror back to Rialto, that's a significant amount of profitability that will come in at the tail end of the fund as opposed to on a regular basis. So there's significant value creation there, but that tends to be backloaded. The quarterly amounts for the real estate fund will be based on the fair value of the assets each quarter.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So quarter-to-quarter, it could differ? It's not as much of a stream?
Bruce E. Gross: Sorry. One more time, Mike?
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I said, so you're saying you've kind of a fair value analysis? So quarter-to-quarter, it might differ, as opposed to kind of like more of a consistent stream?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Mike, it's Jeff Krasnoff. There is a consistent stream from regular operating earnings as well. So the answer is it could vary quarter-by-quarter, but it is an ongoing stream.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I guess I wanted to ask you, Stuart, given the success you've had in the quarter and, arguably, with the early signs of recovery, many clients asked me the question, "What can derail the housing recovery?" And the question is always posed, and as we see the Federal Reserve now with zero fund -- fed fund rates, QE3 likely to end potentially second half or first half of '14, how do we think about those risks and the potential negative impacts on the housing fundamentals and your just overall view on QE3 and the fed funds, et cetera?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, look, as I noted, Ivy, there are political and economic questions that could impact. And clearly, the government is contending with questions of how to deal with the debt issues. And a radical mistake, which I don't think we're prone to make as a country, a radical mistake could derail everything. So I don't want to minimize the possibility that something very severe comes our way in terms of political risk. It just seems unlikely to me. The strength of this recovery, as I see it and as we see it in the field, it really is driven by monthly payment and people desiring to find a stable way to identify their cost of living, monthly cost of living, in a static wage environment and maybe even a growing wage environment. Because of those fundamentals, I think that we are pretty secure in terms of moving forward and continuing to recover. Now in terms of QE3 and the elimination of QE and all those questions, we're really talking about interest rates. And I think that we're -- as we look at our business, we think that there's room for interest rates to go up without derailing the current trajectory. If you really do the math and look at the impact of interest rate, of an increase of 100 or 200 basis points in today's limited shelter alternatives environment, we're likely to see rental rates get pushed up if demand shifts back over to rentals. And therefore, the comparison, even at those higher interest rates, is going to be favorable, and people have to have a place to live. So I think there's pent-up demand. I think there's a shortfall in supply that derives from the downturn. I think that the cost, the monthly cost of living is where people are focused right now, and we're likely to see a continued recovery. That's my best guess.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: No, that's very helpful. I guess my question will be more specific to the strategy, Rick, you alluded to that you prefer to take price over pace, but you have a balancing act to maximize. And what many of our clients are struggling with is trying to differentiate builders and the positioning they have, whether they were, like you, aggressive in the downturn, utilizing your capital structure and positioning yourself. Is it fair to say that even operators that are not as well positioned, as long as home prices are going up, that we should see, generally for the industry and probably Lennar, we'll outperform on margin improvement. Because many think we're hitting a wall because of labor constraints or raw material inflation, land inflation is getting too ahead of us. So just your general comments. I don't know, Rick, if you want to answer that.
Richard Beckwitt: Sure, Ivy. Clearly, if prices continue to increase, the industry will benefit from additional potential margin as long as the builders are careful and controlling the cost and the input cost into the homes. We're working it every day. We're not accepting all price increases that come through, although we are taking some on the chin. And we'll continue to work the inputs into the home. And we have to value engineer to keep costs down, that's what we'll do. I think some companies, and probably the publics, are better at dealing with these type of issues than the privates are. And we're optimistic that margins will continue to increase. We've given that guidance throughout the year, and we'll see where it goes, Ivy.
Stuart A. Miller: Let me just add to that and just say that, look, the increasing costs come from land, labor, materials. Our land component is really well identified over the next couple of years, and the land that we're purchasing is for 2015 and beyond, so we have a pretty good lockdown on the land cost relative to the homes that we'll be delivering over the next couple of years. And that's a big component of what is, in some instances, a cost increase component. From a labor and materials perspective, we think that home price appreciation is likely, as we go forward, to continue to outpace the increases in those 2 areas. We've seen that. I think that we noted in our opening comments that sales price had increased some 9%. Costs were somewhere around 4%. Whether that's a relationship, whether it tightened a little bit, we still see sales price outpacing cost increases as we go forward. One last thing I'll say is as it relates to land, we are buying and have been buying a lot of land, but a lot of that land is in our pipeline already: land deals that have been contracted for, that are in diligence or in some form of entitlement process, that are waiting to be closed. So these land deals, even as we close them from today going forward, many of them were negotiated at a different point in time and help us lock down that cost component.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division: It's John filling in for Stephen today. Since you touched on cost, could you maybe run through the various cost components and what specific materials you're seeing the biggest increase in price? And for those that you are seeing pretty dramatic increases in price, is there any ability to hedge that away? Maybe if you could give some color on that.
Stuart A. Miller: Jon, why don't you take that?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Sure. The materials where we see the biggest increases, in order of that, is lumber being the largest, then drywall and then concrete. On the labor side, associated with that, framing labor has seen the biggest stress and, therefore, the biggest increase; drywall labor as well; and then plumbing and paint labor. Still seeing a lot of the metrics for pressure, upward pressure on those material costs as we look forward, and we expect we'll continue to see that. And the way that we manage -- we don't go out and buy hedges but we, through our national purchasing process, lock in extended contracts. And those vary in length depending on what the materials are. So for example, lumber, which has been volatile, we're typically locking in 3 or 4 months of pricing at a time. Other products and materials, we might be locking in a year at a time. Labor tends to go on a community-specific basis in terms of time period that, that's locked in.
John Coyle - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. That's really helpful. Then just wanted to get an update on the schedule for the big FivePoint Communities that you have out West. I believe the first one to really come on is going to be El Toro. But do you have any update as far as timing for those various communities?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon again. At El Toro, we'll see our first transaction, where we'll be selling homesites to builders, closing sometime in our second -- sometime in this quarter, and for builders to be having a grand opening of their products sometime later this year. At Newhall, we continue to move through the Valencia assets that are on the east side of the freeway. And Newhall Ranch, which is on the west side, is still in its processing of its maps for that process, so that's still probably about 18 months or so in front of us. In San Francisco, Hunters Point, we'll see the first vertical product coming out of the ground by sometime in the late second quarter or early third quarter of this year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim, Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Was wondering if you could talk about the trend in the West. Looking at the order growth, it was a little bit lower. So what we've seen is a lot of communities where they're temporarily sold out in terms of having lots for the future but sort of metering the pace of sales now. Can you talk about how much you're doing that in some of these communities and what we should think about in terms of order growth and pricing and such?
Stuart A. Miller: Jon, go ahead.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Sure. In the West, it will be a very community-specific review of that sales pace. So since there hasn't been much in the way of finished lots being produced by the industry over the last several years, there are many communities which we do meter the rate of sales and suppress it below what the market would demand. So in that case, we are seeing more significant price increases. In some markets where there are finished homesites in front of us, we're able to achieve a much higher sales pace. So for example, in Northern California, in the Sacramento area, where we have a healthy supply of homesites in front of us, or the Inland Empire, we were able to be achieving a higher absorption level because we're able to pick up our production levels.
Richard Beckwitt: And this is Rick. The other thing I'd add is, if you look back over the last several quarters, probably going back through the last 2 or 3, 4, the West has been a large percentage of our new land acquisition. So you'll continue to see some growth stemming from those recently acquired deals in the next year or so.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: And then next, the follow-up, you talked about the market broadening in terms of the recovery overall. We've heard some talk about how traffic isn't improving so much but so that it's very high quality in terms of conversion. Can you comment at all in terms of what you're seeing with the broadening? Are you seeing traffic increasing as well, or how is that, Rick?
Richard Beckwitt: This is Rick. Traffic has been very strong. Quality of traffic is even stronger. Year-to-date, our traffic is up significantly pretty much across the board, and conversion rates are strong. So we're encouraged with what we're seeing out there. It gets back to some of the fundamentals that Stuart mentioned in his opening comments with regard to limited supply, people being -- understanding the qualification process. It's a decent market today.
Operator: The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Stuart, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the 2015 land purchase -- lands you're buying for 2015 and beyond in terms of what the competition is for those kind of lots relative to newer delivery-type lots, what the assumptions you used for those are and kind of what the state of that land is that you're buying or looking at?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, listen, I'll let Rick take the bulk of that. But I think that a lot of the land parcels that we're looking at for 2015 or that we're purchasing for 2015 are really already identified and in our pipeline. We've been working on those deals. Either they're in negotiation and -- or under contract. The assumptions for many of our deals are without a pricing increase model, though, in some instances, we do find that we're injecting some inflation into our underwriting. So Rick, why don't you...
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, I think pretty much across the board, the stuff that we're looking for '15, and '16 for that matter, is things that are not yet developed. They're either raw or need some entitlement work. So we will work jointly with the landowner today, put some seed money into the deal or maybe carry the -- cover the entitlement cost with an opportunity and a lock on the purchase of the land once things happen. And as a result of that, land owners today don't have a lot of capital to invest in the underground -- the underlying property. So it's a win-win deal for us and for them. They move the property along, and we contract it at a wholesale price. So when things pass go and we get everything in line, the approvals, the entitlements, the -- everything the way we want it, the density, we'll close on the land 2 years from now. So it works well for us. With regard to the competition in that piece of the pie, what we found is that most of the other folks right now are looking for current delivery things. There are some that have a land-light model and don't want to invest in underground -- underlying property and develop. So the competition is much more limited.
Stuart A. Miller: I think that one of the advantages, if I could just add, that we're finding, there are 2 groups of potential competitors that are kind of hamstrung right now, the land developers -- the banks are just not lending on land. The old acquisition development loan for land deals is not getting back on track right now. So it really is the well-capitalized public company that has the ability to access the capital to invest in land assets and to drive the entitlement and development process forward. The other group that's really sidelined are the smaller builders. The smaller builders have also had that same access to capital issue where, coming out of the downturn, the banks have just not recast their confidence relative to that group that did not perform particularly well in the downturn, and so they're not competitors. So while the large capitalized -- large well-capitalized homebuilders are out there and competing for some of the same properties, our ability to really cast our sole attention to those later land deals enables us to negotiate well and to position ourselves well and focus just on that group of assets.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: That's helpful. The second question, Bruce, I wanted to ask about gross margins, I know you made a pretty intentional -- it sounded like some potential commentary on some other puts and takes, but I just wanted to ask the question again anyway. If I look at the gross margin this quarter relative to, say, the second quarter of last year when you actually had -- you did greater revenues, Homebuilding revenues this quarter, which would suggest volume maybe didn't -- wasn't a negative impact for you. I was just surprised. I would have thought the gross margins would have been up more, given how strong the reduction in incentives there. So can you just talk about that a little bit more and maybe what I'm missing?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. There is really 2 items that I'd say are different there. Number one, we did have an increased product mix coming from our Central and other regions, where the gross margin percentage tends to be lower than the company's average. And then additionally, our field costs tend to be higher in the first quarter. And what we did is we looked at our states that have colder weather: Minnesota, New Jersey, Colorado, some of the mid-Atlantic and even Pacific Northwest. And there's a number of costs that are involved when you're looking at those winter states that happen in the first quarter. And we went back over the last decade or so, and it's a typical trend that your first quarter falls off as you go sequentially from Q4 to Q1. And even if you looked at similar revenues, you just tend to have more of those winter costs, which, Rick, you might want to highlight a couple of those.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, it's not in all the markets but clearly, Minnesota, Chicago, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, Boston and, to a lesser degree, the Carolinas, depending on the market. They're just incremental direct costs. Excavation is more important, more expensive depending how deep the frost line is, and you've got to over-excavate. You can't use the fill. You got to bring sand in because you can't compact the cold dirt. You got to mix the concrete hot with CO2 and with chloride and water -- hot water. You've got incremental field expenses associated with trenching for the utility lines. Cost of heating the homes is higher. There's just a lot of costs associated with building in the winter. For some markets like Minnesota, it could be $10,000 to $12,000 to $13,000 more per home during that time period of the year. So it happens every year. Depending on the amount of snow and how cold it is, it's worse or better.
Operator: The next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Wanted to follow up on Adam's question about the land purchases. You mentioned you're focusing on land purchases for 2015 and beyond. I wanted to understand, in terms of your land buying activity, how absolute a statement that is. In other words, does that imply that if you see a finished lot deal or your land guys, who are obviously going to be super busy right now, they see a finished lot deal come up, they don't even bother going through the brain damage of submitting a proposal for it just on the presumption that the pricing is not going to be attractive? Maybe if there's some numbers you could give us the kind of help us understand, like 70% of land or lots that you're buying is for 2015 and beyond, some of them may be for a nearer term. Just some color around that, please.
Richard Beckwitt: This is Rick. Clearly, if we find a finished home site deal that's available at good margins with a developer that we're working with today, good relationships, we're going to gobble that thing down. What Stuart and I have been saying is that, given the fact that we have in place today a pipeline of land to meet deliveries through 2014, it gives us the flexibility to focus more on the long, dated type of things that will come online in the later years. We've very focused on leveraging our overhead structure, investing cash, maximizing returns and driving profitability for our shareholders. So to that extent, if we see something that can be added for this year or next year, we're going to focus on that. It just gives us the flexibility to look a little bit longer in the land curve.
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. Just adding to that, we have always been driven by opportunity. And I think that, that is what is unique about our company is our ability to hunt, I think, is better than it's ever been. It's Eric's birthday. He's sitting here in the room. But Eric, I've mentioned before, has been a bridge between Rialto and Lennar, enabling us to find opportunities when we're looking for one thing that really services another part of our company, keeping that open mind to opportunities where and when they might exist that might be off the beaten path. To the extent that we see opportunities to get off-market deals that are not subject to the same competition, the same pricing pressures, where we can make a company-normalized margin, we're all over that. And those kinds of opportunities are still out there for us, and we're still looking for them, it's just not our primary everyday focus. Our primary everyday focus is recognizing that as we go forward, we're going to have a -- we're already stable for 2013 and '14 in terms of what we expect to deliver. And '15 and beyond is where our primary focus is right now.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And second question I wanted to ask about was spec homes under construction. I was just wondering if you can give us an update on those numbers. And in particular, what I wanted to understand was we're heading into the -- or I'm sorry, we're in the spring selling season, obviously, with a greater degree of confidence than we've had in years and years. And so how has that affected your rate of spec build and just generally what you're seeing out there from your other competitors as well?
Stuart A. Miller: Okay. In terms of the spec building, the number of homes under construction that are unsold are 3,667 this quarter, and that's about -- that's 52% of what's under construction during the quarter. And if you look at total starts for the quarter, we had 4,898, and that compares to 2,954 in the first quarter of last year.
Bruce E. Gross: And I guess the other stat we look at is number of completed homes that we have across the universe of our communities that are unsold, and it's less than 2. So we think that we have a very fresh inventory today. We're starting on a very fast clip. We want to get our inventory moving. And if you look at it today versus at the end of the year, we had about 1,600 or 1,700 more homes than where we ended up at the end of the year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Will Randow of Citigroup.
Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Stuart, Rick, I wanted to revisit the color you provided on land spend a few times. I was hoping to get a feel for the breakdown in 3 ways; specifically, what is the breakdown between develop spend -- or development spend, rather, spend on undeveloped dirt and spend on developed lots.
Richard Beckwitt: Will, I don't have the breakdown right now, but we could get it to you later on what was finished versus developed. So I'll have to get back on you -- back to you on that.
Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I guess, could you provide color directionally on how you think -- how you go through that thought process for when you're acquiring today? Is it more on development dollars?
Richard Beckwitt: There are some markets where there's a pretty active development business. Those would be in some of the Texas markets where there's developers that are churning land today. So in those type of markets, we're buying finished homesites on a takedown. I would tell you that across the board, we have been acquiring properties that require some development activity. We've got development skill set in-house, and we're leveraging that expertise. My guess is if I had to pick a number out, it's probably 60%, 70% development-oriented deals, and the balance is either finished or semifinished, take them down on a plot and just doing on-site versus the off-site.
Will Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And then, Bruce, as a follow-up, I may have missed it, but did you mention where demand is tracking second quarter to date? And could you provide any color on what gross margin is for that demand?
Bruce E. Gross: No, to answer your question, Will, we did not give any additional color going into the second quarter on demand, and we didn't talk specifically about the gross margin trend going into the second quarter. But we did reiterate that we're still comfortable that our gross margins for the year will be 23% to 24% for the full year and that the sequential trend will continue where it's lower at the beginning of the year and tends to grow each quarter throughout the year.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.
Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: It's actually Sue for David. Bruce, in your comments, you mentioned that you guys have closed out of your design studios in Houston. And as this recovery is coming together, are you finding that your Everything's Included is sort of ramping up with that in that you're having to make fewer sort of one-off or specific changes to what's in the packages? And as part of that, given that this recovery is more concentrated among the move-up buyers, have you made any fundamental changes to it in order to be more attractive to the buyer that you're seeing out there today?
Richard Beckwitt: This is Rick. In Houston, we do operate under the brand Village Builders, which has a component of a design center, but we still are a very much EI-oriented builder. What we have done on the EI platform is incorporate, just to simplify, the good, better, best type of specification level for our homes. You can't choose the individual items out of the package. It comes with the package, so it's Everything's Included in that package. That's allowed us to move up through the different stages of what someone wants to spend on the homes.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. I'd also add that our EI platform makes it easier for us to ramp up our production because we know what we're going build, we don't have to wait for the customer's order, as well as, in markets where we're able to benefit from greater appreciation by wading into the construction cycle, since we know what's going to go into the home before we sell the home. So our EI platform is both very efficient, as well as it allows us to maximize the margin, having our cost locked in when we start the home, before we sell it.
Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then along those lines, as demand ramps up and as we get further into this cycle, are you seeing any changes in your cycle times? And now do you think those will compare as demand improves relative to past cycles?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon again. We're clearly seeing a small increase in cycle time, as there is stress on the labor market as not only we but the whole industry is increasing the production flow that's out there. It's still below where it was at the peak of the last cycle, and we feel like we're much better able to control it with our more focused product strategy and fewer divisions. So we have more consistency of product. But clearly, as you would naturally expect, as the cycle picks up its volume, we are seeing a little bit of movement in cycle time.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, let's take one last question.
Operator: And the last question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could give us -- given your joint ventures are getting more active, clearly, in places like Valencia or El Toro [ph] as they're coming online, can you give us, one, a description of how much income you expect within a range from your JVs this year versus, let's say, last year? And then taking a step back, are you more inclined to be the seller of the land? Or should we think that the buyer of the land is actually getting a better deal, however you want to cut a balance? Because I would think the seller of the land would be in a better position than the builder. If you could just kind of give us a sense how you balance that in terms of the price you set to the other side, the buyers?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, first of all, we're generally not giving an overall guidance as to what the joint ventures will produce. Those earnings will come as they come, and they will tend to be a little bit lumpy from time to time. In terms of the pricing of the property, the land, right now, those ventures, the FivePoint deal, the deals that fall under the FivePoint umbrella, are really uniquely positioned in just some of the most desirable markets that are extremely land constrained. And any time, as an owner of land and a developer, you find yourself in that position, pricing really does come down to what the seller's selling for. So it really gives us some pricing power and opportunity to drive earnings as the market continues to improve, and we just think that FivePoint is very well positioned. I think Bruce talked earlier about some of the timing relative to some of our positions coming on -- or Jon did. But that's about as much guidance as we give.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Understood. It seems like as a seller of land, you're in the better position. Maybe Bruce or whoever, I think people, investors, have in their mind, given the deflationary environment we faced or are coming out of, that, in fact, specs are lower margin, which in the last 4, 5 years has been the case. But it seems to me, given pricing moving upwards more often than not, can you talk about specs and how you see the spec spread coming in? Because it's seems if you -- especially with an Everything's Included house, if you start building in January and fix the price, you can actually be, in fact, making more money on specs as you move through the cycle if, in fact, the home is worth more in May when you're setting the price as opposed to have locked it in, in January. So can you talk about the impact of spec margins impacting you and if my thesis is correct?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, this is Rick, and I'll start out. And if Jon's got something, he can add to it. We definitely have crossed the line where a spec is not something that's discounted. We are waiting to lock the price of that as late in the process as we can. Our inventory is working for us today as opposed to several years back where someone wanted a discount if there was something that was standing tall in a community that was unsold. So we're letting the appreciation in the market work towards our benefit. And what we are doing also is on presales, we're not discounting those as well. To the extent someone wants a premium homesite in a community, we're loading it with what that homesite premium should be. And for them to choose a homesite and a community and a particular home, we're loading that up at the front-end, given the fact that it probably takes us 2 to 3 months to build it. Jon, do you have...
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Yes, this is Jon. I would just add to that, that, as Rick said earlier, we manage this weekly in each of our communities, what the pace is and pricing. We're clearly able to drive more to our bottom line margin by having our construction cost locked in with a started home versus a presale situation and benefit from an appreciating market by selling later in the cycle. So we should see incrementally more margin, to specifically answer your question, on a spec home versus a presale.
Stuart A. Miller: All right. That concludes our conference call. We want to thank everybody for joining us. Look forward to reporting as we go forward, and thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your conference host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Yes, thank you, and good morning, everyone, joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2012 update. We're certainly pleased to share our results with you this morning. I'm joined by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; and Dave Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, are with us. And Jeff Krasnoff, as always, Chief Executive of Rialto, is here to participate as well. We have recently been together and completed our year-end review and our 2013 look ahead with our regional and division presidents, and we'll share with you some of our insights. I’ll begin this morning with some remarks on the overall state of the housing market. Jon and Rick will provide further color on our homebuilding operations. Jeff will update the Rialto segment, and Bruce will provide some detail on our Financial Services segment, as well as some more color on our overall numbers. As always, after that we'll open up to questions, and we request that during our Q&A time period that each person limit themselves to one question and one related follow-up. So with that, let me begin. 2012 was a turnaround year that confirmed that we had been -- what we had been seeing and communicating for several quarters, and that is that we are in fact in the early stages of the housing recovery. The recovery began in micro markets across the country, and it's continued to spread to larger pockets. In the second half of this year, recovery had taken hold across the country and has readily been seen in spite of generally negative economic data. While the current, more positive economic data still lags behind what we continue to see in the field, it, along with information from reliable economists, have instilled a new level of consumer confidence in the housing market. While there have been and still are economic and political uncertainties ahead, we feel that this housing recovery is fundamentally based and driven by a long-term demographic need for housing. 2012, therefore, we believe, is just the beginning of the recovery as single-family starts come off their lows at just under 600,000 compared to the 50-year household formation average of 1.25 million households per year. Recent years' low housing starts and household formations have created a large pent-up demand of homebuyers who started reentering the housing market in 2012 and are likely to continue to do so into 2013 and beyond. As this incremental pent-up demand unwinds, homebuilders are gaining pricing power. And after years of home prices falling, in 2012 the trend turned positive, initially stabilizing and then allowing for price increases across the country. Prior to this reversal, the fear of purchasing a home and losing equity kept many would-be purchasers sidelined in spite of historically low interest rates and fully loaded monthly ownership costs being low. With the added pressure of price increases, on-the-fence consumers have generally begun to come to the market to take advantage of low home prices and low interest rates. Further fueling pricing power has been the record low levels of both new and existing home inventories as the staff inventory has been absorbed. New single-family homes for sale in November were up slightly from their all-time record low of 142,000 homes to 151,000. While existing single-family home inventory continued to decline through 2012. Additional drivers for homeownership have been the continual increases in rental rates, which, on average, increased about 4% this year as vacancy levels reached their lowest levels in over a decade at 4.5%. It's estimated that there was slightly more than 200,000 multi-family units started in 2012, which is well below the long-term average of 340,000 per year. Across the country, homeownership monthly payments are more favorable versus rental rates. With the difference greater than it's been since the early 1970s, rental rates are projected to continue their upward trajectory due to a general lack of supply. While rents continue to increase, the cost for monthly homeownership remains at very low levels. Impacts from rising home price increases had been largely offset by decreasing interest rates, which reached a low of 3.35% in December. If consumers are able to obtain a mortgage, they are doing so and in turn, saving money on their monthly expenses. The highly conservative mortgage market, however, is still restricted to many consumers. But with further regulatory clarity, as we've seen in recent weeks, the mortgage market should continue to open up at its margins. In our fourth quarter, new orders were up 32% over last year, and our backlog was up 87% and the highest level it's been in 5 years. Gross margins improved to an industry-leading level of 23.5%, a 410-basis-oint increase over last year, and operating margins increased 660 basis points to 12.2%. Margins continue to benefit from our recent land acquisitions, higher home prices, lower incentives and operating leverage from greater absorption per community and more sales overall. Our average selling price for the fourth quarter was $261,000, a 7% increase over last year. Our homebuilding operations have been improving due to a strong operating strategy complemented by an excellent management execution. Our Financial Services segment had another strong quarter, with operating earnings of $33.2 million compared to $9.1 million last year. Our mortgage company captured some 78% of Lennar homebuyers within the markets in which it operates. UAMC has also benefited from a robust -- from the robust refinancing market. Lennar home mortgages should continue to grow alongside of our expanding homebuilding business and more than replace refinancing earnings as they begin to taper off. On the Rialto side of our business, 2012 was a year of many milestones. Rialto closed out its first investment fund, the PPIP program, which garnered an overall 25% rate of return. In the spring, Rialto issued $132 million securitized loan inside of fund -- our first real estate fund, and that money went back into the fund to be reinvested. Additionally, our first Rialto Real Estate Fund was fully called within 6 months following its final close, and total investments in that fund are around $1.1 billion, including commitment leveraged, reinvestment of returns and co-investments. We now have excellent visibility and firmly believe that returns for Fund 1 will well exceed expectations. The success of our first fund enabled Rialto to announce a few weeks ago the first close of Fund 2 in the amount of $260 million, with Lennar investing $100 million. Financially, Rialto continues to contribute to our bottom line every quarter, contributing $4.6 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter and $26 million for fiscal year 2012. And as we go forward, Rialto should remain a solid earnings contributor and will create substantial long-term value for our shareholders. Along with Rialto, 2 other long-term, value-creation initiatives have come to maturity. First, we've been incubating a multi-family rental business strategy that Rick will discuss shortly. We've assembled an all-star rental community development team and are poised to become a major participant in this market. We've also matured our FivePoint land company, which Jon will discuss shortly. FivePoint was initiated during the downturn to manage the restructuring of Newhall Land and Farming. FivePoint has now become the preeminent manager of large, complex, master-planned communities in the Western United States and will benefit substantially from the recovering market. Both of these initiatives, while not short-term earnings producers for 2013, will provide significant long-term value for our shareholders over the coming years. In conclusion, let me say that after 7 years of navigating an unprecedented market downturn, we finally saw stabilization and recovery in 2012. As I reflect on where we've come from and where we're going, I'm optimistic that through -- that though there will be political and economic headline risks, the drivers of our business are fundamentally sound. As the housing market continues its overall trajectory back to normal, it will provide stimulus to the overall economy through job creation, as well as building consumer long-term wealth, which for generations has been a benefit of homeownership. Today, Lennar stands alone with 5 distinct yet complementary operating platforms positioned to capitalize on a recovering real estate market. Our homebuilding machine is fully charged and continues to gain market share. It is well positioned and extremely well managed and will continue to be our primary driver of current earnings. Homebuilding is supported and enhanced by our Financial Services segment, which will grow in step with the homebuilder and continue to develop its third-party operations to enhance its bottom line. Rialto continues to expand its franchise and invest in high-yielding alternative assets while supporting the homebuilder with access to off-market homesites. Our growing multi-family platform provides an additional long-term and complementary growth opportunity for the company and inserts Lennar's name in the -- into the homes of thousands of prospective homebuyers prior to their first home purchase. And finally, FivePoint, with its large, long-term California land assets, simply couldn't be better positioned to reap the benefits of an appreciating land-constrained housing market. I am confident of Lennar's position in today's marketplace and rest assured that our growth trajectory is supported by a strong balance sheet with an exceptional group of people who'll be able to navigate through the challenges and toward the opportunities of 2013. And with that, let me turn it over to Rick.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. As in prior quarters, I'm going to talk about our land acquisition activities and then discuss our new apartment operations. We are really pleased with our operating results this quarter. We exceeded expectations across the board, benefiting from extremely well-purchased land assets. During the fourth quarter, we continued our land acquisition program. This quarter, we purchased approximately 5,500 homesites for $242 million, and we spent $79 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 47% over the prior year period. In addition, we signed contracts to acquire approximately 2,750 homesites. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 45% of our land spend in the fourth quarter was located in the West, 26% in Florida, 9% in Texas, 8% in the mid-Atlantic, 6% in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining 6% spread throughout our other markets. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets we saw the best opportunities. In Q4, we invested heavily in California and Las Vegas. We also have continued to invest aggressively in extremely high-margin opportunities in Florida and Texas, 2 of our strongest markets. While the land market has heated up, we have found no shortage of great land opportunities. We continue to source land outside of the competitive bid environment with the help of Rialto and deep-rooted relationships with local land sellers. At November 30, 2012, we owned and controlled approximately 128,000 homesites and had 459 active communities. While we had guided to a slightly higher year-end community count last quarter, we sold out early in a few communities due to the faster-than-projected sales pace and some new community openings into the first quarter. In any case, we still anticipate ending the year with approximately 550 active communities, with the majority of these new communities coming online in the second half of the year. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter increased about $1 billion to approximately $4.7 billion, and this excludes inventory not owned, consolidated inventory not owned. During the fourth quarter, approximately 54% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put on a contract during the last 4 years. And the gross margin on those closings was about 200 basis points higher than the company average. Now I'd like to discuss our multi-family operation. Many of you, who follow the company, know that we've been nurturing a multi-family rental business for some time now. We entered this business following almost a decade of no new apartment supply because we saw significant pent-up demand and favorable long-term fundamentals. Despite a market rebound in the for-sale housing market, demand for rentals has accelerated, while supply remains extremely constrained. As demand for new sale housing continues to increase from historically low levels, rental demand has continued to grow, fueled by expanding household formations, credit- and down-payment-challenged new homebuyers and a steadily improving employment picture. As a result, we believe that our core homebuilding business and our new rental segment are very complementary and that both should flourish in this recovering market. Multi-family segment began operations in early 2011 and was initially focused on maximizing the value of our underperforming single-family land assets by converting them to rental developments. During 2011, we expanded the scope of this operation to include acquiring new multi-family land assets and seized an opportunity to build an apartment business in a vibrant and growing rental market, while our core homebuilding business was recovering. Today, our multi-family operation has a national footprint, with offices in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Miami, Orange County, San Francisco and Seattle. We have an outstanding team of seasoned apartment development professionals for leveraging the entire Lennar organization to access development opportunities and harness the company's overall purchasing power to become a low-cost producer of Class A apartments in the multi-family space. In 2012, we commenced construction on our 2 developments. We partnered with the Prudential Real Estate Investors for the development of a $32-million, 264-unit community in Johns Creek, Georgia, just northeast of Atlanta. Johns Creek is a highly amenitized Class A suburban infill community. The 3-story garden product is located in North Fulton County adjacent to Technology Park, an extremely low-vacancy market. We also partnered with The Carlyle Group for the development of a $36-million, 316-unit community in Jacksonville, Florida. This 4-story suburban infill community is ideally situated less than 50 yards from the campuses of 2 major employers. We expect to deliver our first phase of apartments in each of these communities by the end of the second quarter. In addition to these communities, we have a geographically diversified development pipeline that exceeds $1 billion and over 6,500 apartments. In 2013, we plan to start construction on approximately 3,000 apartments, with total development costs of approximately $560 million. The capitalization structure for our new multi-family partnerships is approximately 30% equity and 70% debt. Lennar will invest up to 25% of the required equity, with the remaining equity contributed by third-party institutional sources. The debt is non-recourse, project-related construction financing provided by regional and national banks. From an overall capital perspective, Lennar will typically invest approximately 7.5% of the total development cost of each community. At November 30, 2012, we had approximately $30 million invested in this new business, and we see that increasing to $100 million by the end of fiscal 2013. Consistent with our homebuilding business, our underwriting has been extremely conservative. Our underwriting assumes today's rents and targets an unlevered yield on cost of at least 125 to 150 basis points over prevailing cap rates for class A apartments. Depending on the specific deal structure and the economics, our expected returns, assuming a sale 1 year after stabilizations, should yield an IRR to Lennar's equity investment of between 25% and 45% and a cash multiple greater than 2x. While we anticipate merchant building and selling some of these apartment developments once they are stabilized, our long-term goal is to build a portfolio of high-quality, class A, income-producing properties across the country. With the benefit of Lennar's purchasing power and excellent access to unique land opportunities from both Lennar and Rialto, we feel we are extremely well positioned to become a leader in the apartment development business and create significant shareholder value. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Thank you, Rick. And good morning. In the fourth quarter, our sales pace continued at a healthy 3 sales per community per month even as we entered the traditionally slower part of the year, and so far, we have seen continued sales momentum through December into the first part of January. Our increased sales activity has allowed us to focus on improving our pricing power. Our year-over-year average sales price increased by $18,000 or 7% to $261,000. About 40% of that improvement came from a reduction in sales incentives by 320 basis points from 12.2% to 9%. Our ability to improve our sales prices, net of incentives, has enabled us to cover the increases in labor and material costs that are occurring and grow our gross margins by 410 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011. We believe we will continue to improve our net sales price and be able to offset ongoing cost pressures. For the full year of 2013, we expect our average gross margin to be between 23% to 24% compared to 22.7% achieved in 2012. Let me give you some color as to what we saw with respect to construction cost increases. Together, labor and material costs are up $0.64 per square foot year-over-year. This equates to about $1,600 per home. First, I will discuss the labor component of that, which represents about 40% of construction costs. Labor remains under pressure, as housing starts accelerate and hiring by trades is slow to gain momentum. Many trades remain cautious about hiring, as they wait to see that the housing recovery is fully established. We're seeing the greatest pressure and therefore cost increases with framing and drywall labor. Construction Materials also continue to experience upward price pressure. As starts have increased, demand for products is outpacing the ramp-up in production capabilities by manufacturers, as they're cautious to commit the capital to reopen closed plants. As housing starts continue to rise, we expect manufacturers will add back capacity. The material categories that have increased the most over the last year are lumber, drywall, concrete, cabinet and insulation. At Lennar, we maintain an intense focus on analyzing field construction variances and value engineering. [Audio Gap] area to note is that cycle time has lengthened on average by 10 days as compared to last year, and it ranges from no change in some markets to 25 days in markets that are more labor constrained such as Phoenix, parts of Texas and parts of Florida. This increased cycle time, combined with a larger number of early stage sales and backlogs, will result in a backlog conversion ratio of about 75% in our first quarter. We then expect the ratio to be about 90% for the balance of the year. I'll wrap up my comments with a brief discussion on the activities of FivePoint Communities venture in California. Their business model is to create extraordinary value by obtaining development rights for large mixed-use projects and land-constrained markets. This team manages the 12,000-acre Newhall Ranch community in Los Angeles that will ultimately have 27,000 homes and apartments and 13 million square feet of commercial uses. The first 2 maps totaling 5,500 homesites and 2.2 million square feet of commercial uses are in the final stages of completing the entitlement [ph] process and will be brought to market in the next 2 years. In Irvine, California, located in the heart of Orange County, is the former El Toro Marine base. This master plan of over 2,500 acres will be home to the development of the Great Park, which is larger than New York's Central Park. In 2012, 5,000 homesites and 1.2 million square feet of commercial uses were approved. FivePoint has also filed an upzoning application for an additional 5,800 homesites and 4 million square feet of commercial uses. Land development has commenced on the first phase of 726 homesites where Lennar and 7 other builders will grand open 10 villages this summer. [Audio Gap] Park, all located in the city of San Francisco. These committees will total over 20,000 residences in almost 5 million square feet of commercial uses when completed. All 3 are fully entitled, and land development has commenced at Hunters Point. Located in 3 of the best markets in California, Los Angeles, Irvine and San Francisco, the development of these communities totaling over 55,000 homes and apartments and over 20 million square feet of commercial uses will produce significant earnings for Lennar and its partners in the coming years. Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Rick and Stuart have already discussed Rialto's role in the homebuilding story; and as usual, Bruce will cover more of the numerical details behind our financial results as part of his comments. The bulk of our contribution for the quarter and the year has been coming from our growing investment management business, where we invest both our capital and that of third parties in funds and other vehicles. We participate in our share of the income from our investments in these vehicles, as well as the fees and carry interest we receive related to managing those investments. Our first investment vehicle was the public-private investment fund in partnership with the U.S. Department of Treasury and AllianceBernstein. We originally helped to raise the private equity, which was then matched with government equity and advantageous financing, providing our team with approximately $4.5 billion to invest in and manage a large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. During the fourth quarter, we finalized our last sales of the underlying securities in our fund and made our final distributions to the partners, including us. On average, we had $61 million of our equity invested in the fund, and we've now brought back all of that investment, as well as profits and fees, totaling $112 million while generating a 25% internal rate of return for the company, as Stuart mentioned earlier. The Rialto Real Estate Fund was the first fund on our own, for which we raised $700 million of private equity, including $75 million from us. All of our distressed and high-yield investment opportunities since late 2010 were made through this vehicle. We've now invested, as Stuart mentioned, approximately $1 billion of equity in the fund, which includes all of the original commitments, plus another $300 million of capital we were able to recycle earlier than anticipated from asset resolutions, principal and interest payments, property income, and financings. We've been able to invest in almost 60 different transactions amounting to about $2.7 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance for less than $0.40 on the dollar. Activities here helped to contribute over $10 million to the company during the quarter from our share of the fund's underlying earnings, including our fees and reimbursements. Overall, our actual performance has continued to exceed our original underwriting. At the end of September, the net asset value for the fund represented a 26% internal rate of return for investors. In addition, if we continue on this path on performance, we would expect to exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means that over time, carried interest would import back to Rialto as the manager of the fund. And none of that potential value is represented in our earnings today. And now that our first fund has reached full investment, as Stuart mentioned, we expect to continue our program uninterrupted through our second fund, which, in late December, had its first closing of commitments of approximately $260 million, including $100 million from us. Earnings from our early on balance sheet investments, including our structured transactions with the FDIC, continued to lag as a sluggish environment and broad government oversight and involvement have increased our cost to levels we had not anticipated and often in advance of the related revenues. It's worth noting that we made these investments before we refocused our investment strategies utilized our funds, acquiring assets directly from banks and including more assets with invoice cash flow. We've remained very focused on our investments to create long-term value and bring cash back into the company to be recycled. This was an active quarter in cash flow generation from these transactions, and then to date, we have brought in well over $700 million of cash to reduce debt and to begin recycling capital back to the company. Our FDIC transactions have effectively less than $100 million left in net collections in order to fully repay the original $627 million of seller financing, after which we will begin getting our capital back. We expect to begin seeing this later this year and into next. For the near term, we continue to see compelling opportunities for our core areas of expertise, including a clearing of distressed and subperforming assets from financial institutions; the growth of CMBS finance, where we have been a market leader; and providing the vital capital and managements repositioned and refinanced real estate assets. Looking forward, our ability to add new diverse sources of business on our already existing management base of over 230 professionals and our growing fund program and investor base continues to move us further towards our initial plan of utilizing third-party capital to drive return on investment and to create a valuable investment-management platform. We're excited about the future and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Bruce
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. Our net earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.56 per diluted share. This morning, there seemed to be a little confusion surrounding the tax line on our income statement. This morning, there seems to be a little confusion surrounding the tax line on our income statement. Let me clarify that line. We had an $18.6 million net tax benefit for the quarter, which added $0.08 per diluted share. Our guidance last quarter was to assume no tax expense for the quarter. Excluding the impact from this tax benefit, our net earnings for the quarter were $0.48 per diluted share. Let me provide a little more color to the results that you've heard this morning. The company's average sales price increased 7% year-over-year to $261,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: the East region was $245,000, which was up 11%; Southeast Florida was $264,000; that was down 1%, which was due to product mix changes; the Central region was $230,000, up 9%; Houston was $241,000, up 6%; the West region was $310,000, up 1%; and the Other region was $352,000, which was up 4%. Our Financial Services business segment delivered another strong quarter, generating operating earnings of $33.2 million versus $9.1 million in the prior year. The fourth quarter improvement was helped by the strong refinance environment, leading to higher volumes, higher profit per transaction and strong operating leverage. Mortgage pretax income increased to $30.9 million from $9.1 million in the prior year. We integrated the Eagle mortgage operations into our Universal American Mortgage platform over the past year, thereby leveraging both platforms and driving efficiencies. The consolidation of the back offices, secondary marketing and system enhancements resulted in a stronger platform to handle this year's increased volume. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 52%, to $1.4 billion. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers were 53% of the total originations, and that was primarily driven by the increase in the number of refinance transactions. Our title company had a $2.9 million profit in Q4 and that compares with $1.5 million in the prior year. That was driven by a 31% increase in revenues. Adding a little more color to Rialto, the $4.6 million of earnings compares to $8 million in the prior year. Both amounts are net of noncontrolling interest. The composition of the $4.6 million of operating earnings this quarter by type of investment is as follows: The first Rialto Real Estate Fund contributed $4.2 million of earnings; the FDIC portfolios contributed $800,000; the non-FDIC wholly owned portfolios had a $3-million profit. And these amounts were reduced by $3.4 million of G&A expenses and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $7.8 million. As Jeff highlighted, we successfully completed our PPIP investment, and as a result, there is no income statement impact this quarter from the PPIP. This quarter, we reversed $45 million of the remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance, leaving the $89 million in that valuation allowance going forward. If our earnings trend continues, we expect a majority of the remaining valuation allowance will reverse in 2013. Our balance sheet liquidity improved in the fourth quarter, with $1.1 billion of cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $525-million 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility. We continued our balance sheet strategy of pushing out debt maturities while driving down our cost to capital as we raised $350 million of 4.75% 10-year senior notes during the fourth quarter. And during the quarter, we also received the ratings upgrade from Moody's from B1 to Ba3. Our net debt to total capital improved by 80 basis points, to 45.6% over the prior year, and our strong net earnings of $679 million in 2012 was the primary driver of a 27% increase to stockholders' equity, ending the year at $3.4 billion. Turning to 2013, while it hasn't been customary to provide earnings guidance, I wanted to summarize what has been said on the call today and highlight a few additional items for next year. As Rick highlighted, we expect our ending active community count to be approximately 550 at the end of 2013, with a heavier concentration opening in the second half of 2013. Jon highlighted our backlog conversion ratio will be around 75% in the first quarter and then should be about 90% for the remainder of the year. He also highlighted that we continue to see a positive gross margin percentage trend increasing from an average of 22.7% for all of 2012 to between 23% and 24% as an average for 2013, with the typical seasonality throughout the year. Financial Services has seasonality as well and that will continue in 2013. We do expect that the number of refinance transactions will slow down a bit in 2013, and the profit per transaction in the mortgage business is likely to moderate throughout the year. As Jeff highlighted, Rialto is in a transitional year. PPIP was successfully completed in 2012, and Fund 2 will be ramping up throughout 2013, so Rialto profitability is expected to be more back-loaded in 2013. Excluding the impact from additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversals, we expect to have an effective tax rate going forward of approximately 39%. We are well positioned going into 2013 and look forward to another successful year. With that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: I wanted to drill in a little bit on -- Stuart, on your comments related to the mortgage market. I guess my first thought is, do you think that the stringent mortgage environment is an impediment to growth for 2013, '14 and beyond, and that it's necessary for that marginal buyer to have access to mortgage liquidity? Or can you continue to show robust growth despite the fact that there is credit stringency because there's enough pent-up demand or incremental buyers that have the credit? And then secondly, on the QM, you mentioned QM was a clarity relapse. Do you have any comments for us to understand the 3% capital as it relates to your mortgage company, please?
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. As to the first question, Ivy, I think that there is a lot of pent-up demand. That's what we're seeing in the field. There's a lot of sentiment that people want to find their way into homeownership and are willing to push through a much more conservative mortgage market in order to do that. Remembering that new homebuilding is coming off historic lows and trending upward, we think that there's a lot of room for growth even in a somewhat moderated environment. I think that the mortgage market does present itself as somewhat of a limiting factor. We do not see nor do we think it's healthy for the mortgage market to revert back to the liberal standards that we came from, but a reversion to normal, which will take some time, is likely as certainty is brought back to the rules surrounding the financial market. So given the fact that there's very, very strong demand, very compelling reasons to move from a rental world to a for-sale world given the low monthly payments, and given the fact that at the margins, the mortgage market is opening up a little bit at a time, we think that there's -- there are very healthy growth prospects as we look ahead to 2013. And, Bruce, why don't I give it to you for the second part?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure, let me comment on the QM definition that just came out this past week. So there's a year before this goes into place and it's been given a year to work through some of the clarifications that are included. So this clarification needs quite a bit of further clarification, so it's unclear at this point how that's going to work out. But right now, the 3%, we think, if you include the closing costs that we contribute to the buyer in the process, if that's not included in the 3%, then it's essentially a very minimal issue. So the clarification of how our contribution is included is important to figuring that out. We have a year to work through that, so certainly no impact of this year. And we think it's likely to be worked through and we're not expecting any major impact as we go into next year at this point.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, LLC: No, that's a great answer. And I guess my follow-up question, Stuart, could you talk then about a lot of the, I guess, variables in the market that you're faced with and challenges? There's a lot of concern in the investment community about cost inflation, which you addressed, the labor shortages and certainly concern about the land inflation. It seems as if your greatest concern would more likely be about, at least from your company's perspective, is the continuation of replenishing loss as they get absorbed probably more quickly than you anticipated. Can you just give us sort of a ranking to the challenges and is that cost inflation, labor shortages, just a natural part of the cycle? And if not a concern to you, certainly, execution is everything? But I think it would help if you clarify to the investment community your thoughts on these issues that are the most pressing and yet challenging but not debilitating.
Stuart A. Miller: Well, okay. So look, I think that I said there's -- there are political and economic headwind risks out there. There's a big noise factor and some of these things can impact the market, especially consumer confidence. But I think overall, our view is that we're coming off of a very severe downturn. The fundamental reasons for recovery are really pretty solid and fundamental right now. We think, additionally, that consumer confidence is really on a recovery kind of ramp. And so I'm going to kind of take the macro picture out of the equation in terms of my biggest concerns right now just because I think that the more housing recovery -- recovers, the more jobs there are in the marketplace. The more jobs there are, the more confidence there is. And the more people are employed, the more likely they are to go out and buy a home. So to me, I kind of feel like the toughest part of the business is probably the part of the business where we are at our maximum strength and that is, in a recovering market, land becomes the biggest constraining factor. Across the market right now, it is the biggest constraining factor for builders. Driving community count and finding new locations is very difficult. I think we have the A team on the field, both between Rick, Jon and their respective leaders of the company and our Rialto complementary component. I think that the toughest risk factor, the land factor, is one that we have well covered, but I do think it's a risk out there as you look beyond 2013 into '14 and '15 as the market recovers. On the cost side of the equation, I think it's healthy and appropriate that costs start to go up in a recovering market and it actually portends better things for the economy. The fact that labor shortages are starting to present themselves and wages are starting to move up really says that the economy is on the mend, unemployment is likely to go down. And as unemployment goes down, confidence goes up. So we're going to see some cost pressure, but offsetting that cost pressure, we think, are increasing sale prices, which, if you look at the relationship in terms of percentages between cost and revenue, costs have to go up and up an awful lot before revenues don't cover. So I think that there's some risks out there. I think the macro is manageable. I think land is our area of expertise. And I think that the cost increases are actually healthy and will be offset by revenue.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: My first question has to do with the multifamily business, and I think you guys did a great job talking about the capital allocation and the kind of capital build and equity build you guys expect in '13. What I'm trying to get an idea about is, as you look toward the future and you look at the 5 different platforms, are they competitive for internal capital? And I want to get a little more color about the decision-making process as you think about allocating capital between the businesses, because it seems like the hurdles that you're kind of solving for aren't that dissimilar between the homebuilding business, Rialto, the multifamily business and then anything else.
Richard Beckwitt: Well, I guess, from an overall capital perspective, David, I would tell you that all capital competes within the company. We invest in the individuals and the assets that produce the highest returns. That's what we've done consistently throughout this recovery. We dedicated a certain amount of capital for each platform in order to grow those platforms and create value. And depending on how each one of those platforms is capitalized, because the multifamily operation includes a lot of third-party capital, we can grow a very sizable business quickly without using a lot of Lennar capital. So we do dedicate capital to each business. The returns have a tendency to be consistent amongst all the businesses, which is a good thing, and that gives us the luxury of investing in the best of the best.
Stuart A. Miller: Let me just add to that, David, that one of the advantages that the public companies have right now is access to capital that is very, very strong, in many ways unprecedented. It gives us a lot of opportunity to deploy capital and having various arms in which -- through which to do that is, we think, a real benefit. But keep in mind that whether it's the Rialto strategy or the apartment strategy or FivePoint, all 3 of these are primarily focused on third-party capital primarily, with a small portion of company capital invested at a sizable return in line with what we do on the homebuilding side. But we're building franchise value and ultimately long-term shareholder value in building these platforms and growing them forward. It's multiple avenues for investment, limited investment in some of these programs, with a strong opportunity for franchise value in the future.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then just as a quick follow-up, I kind of wanted to ask Ivy's question about labor in a different way. What I wanted to get an idea about was how you feel like your labor subcontractor force is capitalized. And do you think one of the reasons they're a little slow to react in terms of new hiring and expansion is because they're having trouble financing that expansion? And how does that affect you? And how can you guys help?
Stuart A. Miller: No, from what we've been able to see in the field, it does not seem to be that our subcontractor base is limited by their ability to capitalize their growth. We think that they're getting paid almost on a real-time basis as the competition for labor out there requires current payment. So that's not really the limiting factor. I think you have somewhat of a natural dislocation of the labor force through a downturn, where the labor force, especially in a protracted downturn, seeks and moves elsewhere and goes to other parts of the economy. Drawing that labor back is a function of job availability and wages starting to move up. That's happening in the field right now. And I think you're seeing a little bit of a timing issue that is going to work its way out.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: I would just add to that, David, that for the trade, they want to be cautious not to hire and then find that because of political noise and headline risk, the market is not as robust as it seems and then they've got to lay off again. So there's a lag time, as Stuart says, between when they'll actually feel comfortable in hiring and when we need them to be hiring.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen East, ISI Group.
Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Actually, this is Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I was wondering, with respect your cost increases, are you seeing those move up at a steady rate or are they accelerating? Or are we seeing any type of plateau? And then how does that relate to the increases in ASP that you're seeing?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Well, it varies across the range of materials. It's not -- one answer doesn't fit all categories. So lumber, we're seeing lumber futures reach high levels, so that has accelerated. Concrete has accelerated. But other materials have plateaued. And I think that you're going to see a fluctuation as we look forward based on capacity to deliver those materials against the levels of increased starts.
Paul Przybylski - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then if I could sneak in one more. With your land purchasing right now, are you being able -- are you able to pencil deals closer to what we just did in 2012 or closer to your 2013 guidance?
Richard Beckwitt: Our underwriting assumptions haven't changed since we started buying land a couple of years back. We benefit because we're a little bit further advanced and further along the land continuum pipeline, so we're really investing today in deals for 2014, 2015. Don't be confused. We still are underwriting to extremely high margins and you can see it in the numbers.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question, just on the gross margin guidance, 23% to 24%. Bruce, you mentioned some seasonality and just wondering if that would certainly then imply, if I'm just understanding that correctly, that you would expect year-over-year improvement perhaps to continue throughout the year, given the trends of home price appreciation and lowering of incentives outpacing cost inflation.
Bruce E. Gross: The answer is yes, we do expect year-over-year improvement in gross margin percentage and the seasonality, as we've seen last year, starting with lower gross margin in the first quarter and building up through the year.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Second question, on the Rialto earnings breakdown, it's been somewhat choppy in terms of the different line items and appreciate some of the clarity. And we've had PPIP closing out and it had a gain last quarter. FDIC had a loss last quarter, but part of that due to some impairments. How should we think about the FDIC, the $740 million of bank loans, the real estate in terms of trend lining throughout 2013? Should we expect gradual improvement? And also with -- as you get closer to fully defeasing the FDIC debt, would there be any type of more perhaps material improvement in those earnings? Or is that a non-factor from an accounting standpoint?
Stuart A. Miller: Let me say that Rialto continues to be a little bit choppy and a lot of that derives from the initial FDIC deal. We invested a lot of company capital in that deal with the -- with a higher expectation of return. We've talked about this in past quarters. Those levels and expectations have come down in large part because the resolution, the market for resolution of distressed loans just has been different than our past experience. And so what we're looking forward to with the FDIC program is a complete defeasance of the debt and then a return of that capital to be redeployed and at much more substantial returns. That's the negative side of Rialto. The positive side of Rialto is that every investment since that FDIC has built on that initial start-up investment and has been a success in terms of our underwriting standards which were recalibrated and the new investments coming in. So there's a little bit of an offset. There continues to be a little bit of choppiness in Rialto as we look ahead, as 2013 continues to be a transitional year. But Rialto is becoming a very substantial manager of third-party capital and investing that capital extremely well. And as we enter our Fund #2, we're expecting a lot of success and bottom line growth.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Appreciate it. Can I squeeze one more in on SG&A real quick?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: You had an incremental variable rate on SG&A in 2012 of roughly little over 6%. How should we think about 2013 as you're growing your community count fairly substantially?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. So again, as we're growing our community count substantially, there's a couple of things to think about. Number one, we're still selling at a sales pace that's well below normal. So this last quarter, we had 3 sales per community per month. When we get closer to 4 sales per community per month, then it will kind of flatten out. So there's more leverage that we will be seeing in the SG&A line as volumes increase and even though we're opening new communities. Additionally, the variable expenses, we did have some doubling up last year because we had different stock awards that, that compensation expense was flowing through in 2012 and some of those are no longer being expensed. So we don't expect on the corporate side the G&A to go up at the same level. We expect to get a lot more leverage on the corporate side.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to ask you a sort of a general question about your expansion into multifamily. You guys more than any other builder have really demonstrated an ability to sort of move into alternative streams of profitability and this seems like yet another opportunity, it seems like a good one. I guess, in helping us understand how large this opportunity could ultimately be -- I know you've laid out some general guidelines in terms of the next year or so, but thinking out more broadly than that, are there certain -- can you help us think what the limitations are for this business, if there are any that you foresee, in terms of it relative to your homebuilding platforms in all the various markets that you're in? For example, are there ways that you can easily express markets that you're in, in a homebuilding basis that you wouldn't be interested on a multifamily basis? Are there certain resources and the types of land acquisition opportunities that you see typically that are suitable for multifamily and where there are certain limitations? Or is this a business that you could scale pretty freely relative to your homebuilding operations?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, Steve, it's Rick. Clearly, we've got the footprint out there to grow a very sizable business. If you look at the major metropolitan areas that we are in, we can scale a business relatively quickly in those markets that will be sizable. You see that within a year, we had created about a $1-billion pipeline. I think that's just scratching the surface of what the opportunity is out there, especially as we leverage the mother ship and growing this through purchasing and synergies from an overall operating standpoint. If you'd step back and when you look at the basic fundamentals of a land buyer, we are -- we often, in the past, would sell the multifamily pieces, the commercial pieces for someone else to sort of ring the bell and make a lot of money on. And as we sat and looked at what we were doing in the land market in a recovering market, it didn't make sense to not maximize the skill set that we had in place. It's easier to build a multifamily complex than it is to actually build separate homes. So what we did is we structured an organization, we've surrounded ourselves with talent and we've been building this business and it will become very sizable.
Stuart A. Miller: Let me just add to that and say that, look, one of the drivers that we had in moving forward with multifamily is, first of all, historically, multifamily has been 2, 3, 350,000 starts a year and that's consistent over a long period of time. There is a consistent demand for multifamily and we think we have a distinct advantage. We're already looking for residential land. Often, it's an appendage of a broader or bigger property that we're already purchasing. We have the Rialto eyes also out there for these types of properties. And we have the complementary construction business that's already in place, where we can leverage efficiencies over a broader community. But our general thesis relative to entering multifamily is given the severe downturn in the residential markets over the past years, given the limited supply of rental that is out there, the recovery of the housing market would be moderated by a much more conservative mortgage market going forward, which means there will consistently be a large group of people who simply can't buy a home and won't buy a home and are looking for rentals. And then all of the major markets where we build for-sale homes, there's going to be a sizable demand for rental at the same time side by side. For-sale housing will continue to recover. It'll be moderated by a sluggish or conservatized mortgage market, and rental will remain strong as well.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. Well, that's a pretty exciting opportunity and I wish you the best of luck with that. I wanted to ask you a question, if I could switch back to the more pedestrian homebuilding side of your business, and it's related to the gross margin guidance. I just wanted to clarify the guidance you've given there. For while it's strong and you guys have seen a nice recovery in gross margins already, I was -- I'm thinking that perhaps some are wondering if it could have been stronger, your guidance could have been stronger. And I'm curious, you mentioned that there is an upward trajectory in prices, but I assume that your gross margin does not assume or embed in it an increase beyond what we've seen thus far in prices. I'm curious as to whether or not that's true and also whether or not you are assuming any increases in costs next year for the units that you're going to be building next year, perhaps costs that were negotiated in a bit of a -- at the end of last year or being renegotiated now that will be at a higher level in 2013, for example, that's embedded in your assumption as well.
Bruce E. Gross: So this is Bruce. To answer your question, Steve, that is correct. We're not assuming higher average sales price increases than what we've seen, number one. And number two, we are seeing some higher costs embedded in our guidance, but our guidance is really saying that we believe we will more than offset the cost increases that we're seeing in the business right now, between sales prices going up some, sales incentives coming down, bringing in some of these new communities that we keep talking about that are at a higher gross margin than the company average, partially offset by some cost increases that we're expecting through 2013.
Operator: The next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall, RBC.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up, I think, on Rick's comments. It sounds like Johns Creek and the Jacksonville build-out are ramping up pretty quickly. When should we start to anticipate seeing any meaningful or material impact for the multifamily business on the P&L? And what's the trajectory? You used the word in the press release, incubate? What point do you feel the business really has scale that really matters to the Lennar story?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, from an earnings standpoint, Bob, given the fact that these things take 1 year to 1.5 years to 2 years to build, you've got to lease them up and stabilize them. So you're looking at probably 3 years out before there can be a pretty decent stream of income if we're going to sell the properties. In a perfect world, what we'd do is we'd have a development operation where we'd sell the buildings, and then we would also be a piece of the operating company on the other side through a fund ownership structure where we can accumulate a huge portfolio of income-producing properties that would benefit the company on the long-term basis. So it was an earnings drag for us in 2012. It's not going to produce earnings in 2013, but in '14 and '15, you'll start to see some contribution from this new business.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: And just staying with the multifamily, there's some pretty established operators and there are, like, Equity Residential and Avalon Bay, but at the same time, it sounds like you feel it's not too crowded an environment. Is this just really a kind of bold call on the recovery of the multifamily segment, as well as single family?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, as Stuart and I highlighted, the growth opportunity in multifamily is pretty big today, especially given the fact that the business has been shut down from a new product standpoint over the last decade. We see significant opportunities out there. You got to keep in mind that a lot of people that play in the multifamily space are not developers, they're actually going out and acquiring existing assets out there and paying the cap rate. We do feel that we have expertise in development. It's not any different to build a condo building than it is to build a 3-story garden. And we're going to capture that development profit and, ultimately, build a portfolio of assets.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Good. It sounds like a nice complement to your core homebuilding.
Operator: The next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. I just wanted to ask you a question about you've got the 5 different businesses and, obviously, Financial Services is most complementary to homebuilding, but then you've got the other 3, and I think you've kind of indicated in the past that maybe you would be willing to spin off Rialto in the right environment at some point in the future. Now with FivePoint and the multifamily, would you ever be willing to do that? And what kind of hurdles would you be looking for where you would come to that decision?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, just putting things in proper perspective, I mean, Financial Services is directly related to homebuilding, but FivePoint, likewise, is a direct offshoot of our land and homebuilding operations as well, so it's extremely complementary in much the same way. The apartment component is really a side-by-side relationship as well, and Rialto is a little bit more removed from our primary business. With that said, I think that the reason we highlight these other 3 businesses today is not by way of mapping out earnings for 2013 and '14, but by way of highlighting that within the company, these are the things that we've been working on that we think create long-term value and potentially might be -- we've created them with the optionality of keeping them within the company to the extent that they enhance the bottom line going forward or spinning them out as self-sustained entities as we did with LNR in the 1990s. We've highlighted that we might do that with Rialto. And these other companies also can be stand-alones at some point. It's maximum optionality for the creation of shareholder value over the long term.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then on the multifamily business, is a lot of the source of the land going to be coming from Rialto? And then also, have you looked at -- you kind of thrown out the longer-term multifamily start summaries. Have you looked at what kind of a normalized market share you could have of that?
Stuart A. Miller: We haven't looked at market share, what a normalized market share would look like. In terms of where the land is coming from and will come from, some of the land is coming from our own, wholly owned assets that are being repurposed for apartment and brought to market sooner than they might otherwise be in a for-sale environment. But by and large, we've used that as a springboard to develop a first-class management team. And most of the apartment rental communities or the land for those communities is being sought for exactly that purpose and is being purchased in the open market. So there are new opportunities. They might be side by side with for-sale or with something that Rialto is doing. They're not coming from Rialto.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Regarding Rialto, does the increased interest in REO properties from institutional investors, particularly single-family rentals, create any opportunities such as through bulk portfolio sales, through asset management of REO, assets for portfolio holders or through the market's increased demand for REO properties more broadly?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: It's Jeff. I'd say the demand really has -- has really impacted, it's more on the sales side. We've been an active seller of homes that we've taken back, but not directly from consumers but from developers that -- where we may have bought the distressed debt. I think, to date, we've probably sold about 1,000 homes. So there's pretty good demand out there for it. In terms of looking at bulk opportunities, we've also been looking at some of that. And we've been looking at some of the other opportunities that are out there that you've mentioned as we have not been a large entrant in the buying of single-family homes for rental.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Land sales picked up in the quarter and were at the highest levels since 2008. Is this onetime in nature or seasonal or would you expect a further pickup going forward? And specifically, could you look to monetize any of the internally developed land on purchases made during the market decline through an increase in land sales?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Yes, Jade, land sales continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter. So when this quarter's results do indicate that, it's going to continue at that trajectory. It will be a little bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter.
Operator: And the last question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I wanted to go back to gross margins, but I wanted to talk about a little bit longer term, if possible. One, I was wondering if -- what the impact from prior impairments was on gross margins right now. And then I wanted to, Bruce, ask you what you think -- whenever you think we're going to be back in a new normal kind of environment, of normal starts levels, what you think gross -- Lennar's gross margins could be? And the reason I ask is because I think there's a lot of optimism built into your company and into the industry. And some of the -- my competitors' estimates and some of the new estimates I've talked about with investors seem to suggest that gross margins in the next upswing are going to exceed prior cycles and that history is not going to repeat itself and you're going to have better gross margins. So I was just curious what you thought of that and if that's the way you think things are going to play out.
Bruce E. Gross: So with respect to the prior impairments going through our gross margin, it's not a number that we've tracked, but what I would say is that, that number isn't -- I won't expect it's very significant as we've been growing our volume and we had over, I think, it's 54% of our deliveries were coming from new communities at this time. So that's not a very large number that's flowing through the P&L, is what I would expect. And going forward, as far as gross margins, we think there are a number of opportunities for the gross margins to continue to grow. And obviously, we've talked about some of them today. Average sales prices are still well below where they were at the peak. And with affordability being very high, there's room for average sales prices to grow, especially as inventories, as constrained as it is, and the rent versus buy equation is in favor of buying. We have more new communities coming online. The gross margin in the new communities is still over about 200 basis points above the company average. And we have sales incentives that are continuing to have the ability to continue to decline. And then you have costs that will go up, but that's a smaller percentage of the equation because your costs are less than 1/2 of the sale price. So going forward, there's room for it to go up, but I think we just want to moderate it. We want to see the results first before people get too carried away with the gross margin in their models.
Stuart A. Miller: Right. Let me just say that we are looking ahead with a conservative view. As we look at the market in general, as we look at land constraint, as we look at the recalibrated cost structure that we and others have in place, and as we recognize that home prices are not skyrocketing and shooting up, but they are reverting to normal, which means, in part, the base price of homes is going up. And in comparable part, we are eliminating an incentive structure that has been rather dramatic in order to sell homes during a downturn and that is working its way out. There's real opportunity for margins to go up. We're going to cautiously look ahead, seeing our margins go up in orderly progression. But I think that there is opportunity to the upside in terms of margin growth. And I think that's a large part of why you're seeing a lot of people who look at the housing market today look ahead to the next couple of years and say, with land shortage and with a reversion to normal in pricing and elimination of incentives, there's a lot of opportunity for margin growth.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I think that's exactly why I'm asking the question because -- and I just -- I guess, what do you think the -- I mean, a lot of the things you talk about makes sense, but those things have to happen, all of your competitors have to act that same way, so do you think there's a -- is there -- traditionally, the industry liked to say 18% to 20% was the gross margin and that's what everybody said. And do you think there's an industry kind of cap where incentives might be where they are and you can reduce them, but somebody's going to then lower them to take some share? So how much of your optimism, recognizing you're still being conservative, but how much of that might be tempered by the industry's structure? And how do those 2 levers counteract each other?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, I think we have seen that in prior recoveries. As I look back, we've certainly seen that as the market recovers, people do sometimes moderate the margin they can get with the one that they trade off for volume. What -- but the governor here is the scarcity of land. You just can't replace the most important commodity as readily as we've seen in the past. And therefore, when you look at the competitive landscape, if someone's got a good land position, they'd better harvest the best margin that they can or that land is going to dissipate and they're not going to be able to replace it. That's the governor that's out there and why we think that margins have more opportunity to the upside than risk to the downside. All right, listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us on our fourth quarter update, and we look forward to reporting through 2013.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your conference host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Great. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thank you, David. Thanks, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter 2012 update. We're pleased to detail our results for you this morning. As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Dave Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment, are here to participate as well. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, will join us by conference line from California and also will participate. I'm going to begin this morning with some brief opening remarks about the housing market in general and about our first quarter results. Rick and Jon will comment on specific aspects of Lennar's Homebuilding operations and Jeff will update performance in our Rialto segment and Bruce will conclude and add specifics with the financial review. Simply put, the housing market is recovering. Not only are sales, margins and backlogs improving, but the beginnings of a sense of visibility are coming back to underwriting land acquisitions and planning for the future. The Homebuilding business is beginning to revert to normal and that's positive for the U.S. economy in general, which is, in turn, good for a sustained recovery in the housing market. Last quarter, I noted various trends that were driving stabilization and recovery in housing. Those trends have continued to define the path to recovery. Briefly, those drivers are: one, home price value and interest rates driving affordability; two, for-sale monthly payments compare favorably to rentals; three, inventories of distressed homes and foreclosures are declining; four, consumer confidence is improving and consumers don't want to miss current prices and interest rates; and five, the mortgage approval process is stabilizing and getting marginally better. In fact, on this last trend, we see with QE3 that the government is focused on the home mortgage market and is working to keep rates low and to maintain an orderly flow of capital to the mortgage market. To me, at least, this is an important harbinger of future focus on nurturing a housing recovery. Overall, demand has been improving and we've seen consistent sales pace at improving prices; that is, prices that are reverting from overcorrected lows to normal throughout our third quarter. Our steady traffic and sales pace indicates stronger demand trends as we have seen a material increase in our monthly sales per community from about 1.5 to 2 per month to this quarter at 3.2 sales per community per month. These improved results come with gross margins that are consistent with our current deliveries, indicating that we are not and have not been reaching for volume. While I'm increasingly enthusiastic about the housing recovery, I don't want to overstate the case. While the trend is decidedly positive, stabilization and recovery are still uneven across the country and even within markets. As I've said before, the housing depression was a national phenomenon while the recovery is very local. We're continuing to see pockets of activity develop across the country that are recovering and these pockets are growing, while still the broader market outside of these pockets often remains weak. Additionally, demand trends continue to be constrained by mortgage qualification standards and processes that define today's mortgage market and remains overcorrected by the severity of the downturn. But demand is growing and more and more consumers continue to look for some loosening of credit standards. With the market improving and driven by sound fundamentals, it's beginning to be interesting to be a homebuilder again. Let me turn briefly to Lennar specifically as our management team will give additional color on our results. In our third quarter, we saw continued improvement in all of the building blocks that define our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations, while Rialto enhanced and expanded its blue chip operating platform. Each of our operating segments remained profitable in the third quarter as our associates across the country are really executing on all fronts. On the Homebuilding front, each element of our business has continued to improve. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, closings were up 28% versus 20% last quarter. New orders increased 44% versus 40% last quarter. Our backlog improved 79% versus 61% last quarter and gross margins of 23.2% versus 22.5% last quarter translated into our healthy operating margin of 11.2% versus 9.2% last quarter as SG&A declined to 12% versus 13.2% last quarter. We are clearly seeing the impact of operating leverage that we expected as the market has stabilized and as sales per community have increased. As we look ahead to future quarters, improved sales per community, together with increased community count, will be the engine that drives the SG&A operating leverage that will produce strong and sustainable bottom line earnings even as construction costs do trend upward. Our overall strategy of focusing on high margins in well-positioned communities has clearly paid off. Lennar's Homebuilding operations are operating soundly and are defined by excellent hands-on management running the day-to-day activities while excellent new communities are identified and added to each division. Lennar Financial Services had another excellent quarter as well with operating earnings of $25.3 million. Lennar Financial Services has continued to expand alongside of the core Homebuilding business, providing excellent service to our customers and leveraging increased volume. Additionally, we've opportunistically added incremental volume by participating in the refinance market. Rialto continued to play a central part in the improving Lennar story. Rialto contributed $7.7 million of operating earnings, while the Rialto connections and relationships have continued to help grow and expand our core Homebuilding business. The synergy between our Rialto segment and our Homebuilding segment continues to exceed every expectation that we had when we began to grow this business. Rialto results include the wind-down of our PPIP program that Jeff will discuss in just a few minutes. But perhaps most noteworthy is the fact that capital invested in the start-up of Rialto is beginning to cycle back to Lennar and will enable us to aggressively grow our homebuilding platform while Rialto continues to invest third-party capital. The Rialto franchise will continue to be a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals for some time to come, while the base Rialto business continues to ramp its earnings. As we look ahead, Rialto should continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will continue to return cash to corporate. All in all, our third quarter 2012 results mark an excellent stepping stone to strong future performance. We are feeling more and more comfortable that the current trend is, in fact, the beginning of a new cycle for housing. As I look ahead to the remainder of this year, and towards 2013, I'm increasingly optimistic that we are seeing a real recovery in housing and that we will continue to see improvement. With national new home deliveries in 2012 expected in the 450,000 to 500,000 range, there's a lot of opportunity for expansion as the market normalizes over the next years to a normalized million home plus. Additionally, with smaller builders temporarily hamstrung by constrained capital markets, larger, well-capitalized builders like Lennar have a head start and can expect market share gains. Assuming this market recovery is not derailed, expanding deliveries and fewer participants should provide us with some excellent opportunities. Lennar's positioned with a strong balance sheet in the right markets with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions continue to improve. All of the segments of our company are performing well and are extremely well positioned, as you will now hear from our operating team. Let me turn over to Jon now.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Good morning. As Stuart noted, we saw continued improvement in our third quarter results with a post impairment 23.2% gross margin and an 11.2% net operating margin. This bottom line profitability was driven by our focus on pricing strategies, product offerings, direct cost management and by leveraging our operating structure. We continued to see a normalized sales pace in the third quarter, with a rate of 3.2 sales per community per month as compared to last year with a 2.2 sales per month rate. This level of activity produced 4,198 new orders and has positioned us with a backlog of 4,513 homes, respectively, 44% and 79% year-over-year improvement. In the context of these improving market conditions, many investors' questions have turned to the cost side of the equation. Let me give you some color as to what we see going on in the field. In the third quarter, we saw cost increases in all of our markets. The level of these increases range from $2,000 to $3,000 per home and an average total of about $2,400 per home or just over $1 per square foot. This equates to about 10 basis points of our average sales price. Many of these increases are not yet reflected in our closings as the timing of the effective date on each contract will vary. Cost increases range by product type and from region to region, depending upon the local supply-demand balances. The material categories that have increased the most over the last year are lumber, drywall and concrete. Together, these categories are up year-over-year, about $0.75 per square foot. In some markets, labor constraints are also contributing to the increasing costs. This is most commonly seen in framing and drywall labor. As an offset, we continue to implement cost reductions with the systems and controls we put in place during the downturn. Through a nationally driven purchasing process, we've achieved savings that reduce the impact of these cost increases. Through our process for analyzing field construction variances, we have reduced material quantities used in our homes, saving about $0.18 per square foot year-over-year. Another example of this is our value engineering review on hardware and beams that has saved us about $0.22 per square foot. Cycle time is another topic where we received questions from investors. While to date, our average cycle time has remained level, there are areas with shortages of labor supply that could drive cycle time a little higher. Markets like Phoenix, parts of Florida and Texas have labor shortages in some trades while other markets like the Inland Empire, Dallas and Charlotte have labor pools that have been able to absorb the increase in activity. Again, we believe that our strong management team will mitigate most of the impact of these labor shortages. While construction costs are trending up as the market normalizes, we're finding the opportunity to improve our sales prices. Sales pricing appears to be reverting back to normal market conditions. Prices had overcorrected during the downturn, dropping by as much as 25% to 30%. So the 4% year-over-year improvement in our average sales price represents the continuation of an adjustment, not back to peak conditions, but to a more normal market condition. The opportunity to improve prices comes from a combination of reducing incentives and raising prices. Our average incentives for the third quarter were down to 9.2%, a 280-basis point improvement. Our average sales price was $258,000, an improvement of $11,000 over last year. We expect as pricing returns to normal, we will be able to cover cost increases and deliver the high level of gross margin we achieved in the third quarter as we move forward. With our increased volume, we continue to leverage our operating structure. With deliveries up 28% year-over-year, our SG&A dropped to 12% of revenues, a 230-basis point improvement. Again, the disciplines put in place during the downturn help us manage our overhead as conditions improve. An example of this is our advertising spend where we reduced our total advertising cost by 25% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. This drop represents 70 basis points of the 230-basis point reduction in SG&A. As market conditions improved, we were quick to address our advertising and other selling costs that were no longer necessary. As we look forward, we believe our management team and the systems and controls we have in place and the reengineering of our company during the downturn will work to provide industry-leading operating margins. Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Rick.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Jon. We're really pleased with the operating results we had this quarter. These results were driven by both a well-executed land acquisition strategy and a fine-tuned homebuilding machine. As in prior quarters, I'm going to review our land activities and explain why Lennar is positioned to succeed in today's recovering market. During the quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring or auctioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. This quarter, we purchased approximately 8,300 homesites for $339 million, and we spent about $81 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 67% over the prior year period. In addition, we signed contracts to acquire approximately 8,000 homesites. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 55% of our land spend in the third quarter was located in the West, 14% in Florida, 13% in Texas, 7% in the mid-Atlantic, with the remaining 11% spread throughout our other markets. The lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of the competitive bid environment and were relationship-based deals. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets we saw the best opportunities. In Q3, we invested heavily in the West, particularly in California. We also continue to invest in some unique high-margin opportunities in Florida and Texas, 2 of our strongest markets. You will continue to see quarter-to-quarter changes in the geographic mix of our land purchases as we capitalize on the best opportunities out there. While the land market has heated up, we found no shortage of great opportunities. Strategically, we are still pursuing finished homesite deals, which, in today's market, provide a higher return on investment in exchange for a somewhat lower gross margin. The risk reward associated with these deals is still very compelling, especially given the operating leverage we have today in our company. These deals can be brought online very quickly without any significant overhead, and the profits fall right to the bottom line. However, the better-located finished homesite deals are getting harder to find because the land development and entitlement business shut down in the depths of the market decline. Nonetheless, the deep-rooted relationships we formed with land sellers during the market turmoil positions us extremely well in locking up what is available. Recognizing this inevitable shortage, for the past several years, we have been aggressively tying up high-margin, low-cost deals where Lennar will develop the land internally. Under the radar, while many of the other builders were focused solely on purchasing finished homesites, we have amassed some incredible properties across the country in A-plus locations where finished homesites are running scarce. We started by acquiring large-scale busted development deals where much of the infrastructure was already in the ground. In these deals, the development costs are relatively modest and finished homesites can be brought on and produced relatively quickly. We then moved to early-stage raw land opportunities that required adjustments in zoning and other entitlements in order to work in today's market. Many of these were infill locations. In these deals, we tied up the property and invested our intellectual capital by working with land sellers, towns and municipalities to create win-win programs. In each case, these deals provide us with low-cost finished homesites in class A locations where there will be very little new for-sale housing close by. The good news is that many of these deals are coming online now and will continue to do so throughout 2013. At August 31, 2012, we owned and controlled approximately 124,000 homesites and had 444 active communities. We should end the fiscal year with about 480 active communities, many of which will be coming online late in the fourth quarter. Our community count by the end of 2013 should grow by approximately 15% based on the deals we have in hand today. We also expect that about 25% of these new communities will be legacy and mothballed communities where we already own the land and have waited for market values to recover. We're excited to bring these inactive communities to the market. As we move into 2013, while our focus to date has been on maintaining community count and increasing absorptions per community, our focus today has shifted to increasing both community count and absorptions. We are operating very efficiently today, and with the added fuel from our newer land deals, our operating leverage will be substantial. We have been relentless in our pursuit of new opportunities and I'd like to thank our people for their hard work and dedication. Simply put, they are in a league of their own. Before I turn it over to Jeff, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory at the end of the third quarter increased by about $845 million to approximately $4.7 billion, and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Sequentially, during the third quarter, our inventory increased about $276 million from the second quarter. During the third quarter, approximately 51% of our deliveries came from communities purchased to put under contract during the last 3 years. Our gross margin on the closings from these new communities has continued to exceed the company average by about 200 basis points. I'd like to turn it to Jeff.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. During the current quarter, Rialto contributed $7.7 million of earnings to the company. While Bruce will walk you through in more detail the components of our contribution, the bulk of our earnings are from our growing investment management business, where we invest both our capital and that of third parties in funds and other vehicles. We participate in our share of the income from our investments in these vehicles, as well as the fees and carried interest we receive related to managing those investments. As an example, this quarter, we effectively wrapped up the bulk of our first vehicle, our public-private investment fund in partnership with the U.S. Department of Treasury. During the 2.5-year life of our $4.6 billion PPIP fund, we had, on average, $61 million of our equity outstanding as an investor in the fund that we helped to manage. Effective today, we've now recycled back in cash from interest income, capital gains, fees and carried interest almost $110 million, while generating a 25% internal rate of return. In addition, now that this very successful program is wrapped up with almost $16 million of earnings this quarter, the volatility associated with mark-to-market accounting has been eliminated. Similarly, our Rialto Real Estate Fund with $700 million of private equity commitments, including $75 million from us, had another strong quarter, contributing $10.6 million from our share of the funds' underlying earnings, plus our fees and reimbursements. All of our distressed debt investments since the fund's first closing in late 2010 have been made through this vehicle. We've now called all of the fund's original equity commitments to acquire in 44 separate transactions about $2 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance and for less than $0.40 on the dollar. So far, we've done extremely well, exceeding our original underwriting and taking in over $275 million from asset resolutions, interest and property income, principal paydowns and financings. These cash collections have allowed us to recycle equity into new fund investments beyond the original $700 million of commitments even as we work on raising and closing our next real estate fund. At the end of June, the net asset value for the fund represented over a 27% net internal rate of return for our investors. In addition, if we continue on this path on performance, we would expect to exceed the return hurdles set for our investors, which means that over time, carried interest would enure to Rialto who is the manager of the fund. None of that potential value is represented in our earnings today. Our pipeline of new investments also continues to be strong as the relationships we have built with sellers have put us in an advantageous position. These relationships have also led to perhaps the most significant and unexpected contribution that Rialto has added to the Lennar enterprise. As Stuart and Rick have already indicated, the invaluable access to lenders and distressed borrowers has helped to drive our primary Homebuilding business. Together, we've been able to add thousands of advantageously priced homesites across dozens of new Lennar communities in multiple markets and with more in the pipeline. Our early on balance sheet investments, however, continue to lag as the sluggish environment has slowed revenues. In addition, broad government oversight involvement has increased our cost to levels we had not anticipated. We're finding that a number of borrowers and guarantors in our earlier deals, emboldened by the long delays available in the judicial system and sympathetic legislatures, have been taking obstinate positions about repaying their personally guaranteed loans or electing not to perform after agreeing with us on restructured loan terms. The related higher costs involved, including those from owning and managing over $2 billion by principal balance of foreclosed properties, must be expensed upfront while revenue recognition is delayed until resolutions or sales occur in future periods. This extended timing and anticipated reduction in net collections, primarily in our FDIC portfolios, was reflected in the top to bottom review we just completed and is what drove the impairments we recognized this quarter and which Bruce will also cover in more detail. It's worth noting we're not seeing anything similar with our later investments as we have recalibrated our newer purchases to this environment and focused our efforts on buying directly from banks and purposely selected loans secured by vertical collateral, often with in-place operating cash flow as compared with a significant land component in our earlier transactions. Nonetheless, we remain very focused on these balance sheet investments to create long-term value and bring cash back to the company to be recycled. Overall, we've already collected over $700 million of cash in these investments to date. The biggest component of that relates to the FDIC transactions where we have approximately $211 million left in net collections in order to fully repay the original $627 million of seller financing, after which we begin receiving cash distributions. As we look forward, without the volatility from our PPIP investment, our future fund investment business should not only help to enhance the company's returns and add more consistent cash flow and earnings, but also be an important building block for us to create a valuable investment management platform. Our ability to add new sources of business on our already existing management base of over 200 professionals, our current position in the market place and the synergies with the rest of Lennar operations, we expect in due course, will be reflected in growing value for our shareholders. We're excited about the future and look forward to reporting to you on our progress. Thank you. Bruce?
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll provide a little more color to the results, starting with Homebuilding. The company's average sales price, that increased 4% year-over-year to $258,000. I'd like to give a breakdown by region. The East region was $245,000, up 11%; Southeast Florida was $278,000, up 1%; Central, $225,000, up 1%; Houston, $236,000, up 3%; West Region, $299,000, down 1%; Other, $358,000, down 5%. Jon and Rick already highlighted the drivers of our strong gross margin performance and significant operating leverage during the quarter, so I'm going to turn to the Financial Services segment. We had a good quarter in Financial Services, generating operating earnings of $25.3 million versus $8 million last year. The third quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year for the Financial Services segment and it was helped further this year with the strong refinance environment leading to higher volumes and strong operating leverage. Mortgage pretax income increased to $22.3 million from $7.4 million in the prior year. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 72% to $1.3 billion. Our in-house mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 75% this quarter. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers increased 116% this quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of refinance transactions. Our title company had a $3.6 million profit in Q3 and that compared with $1.3 million in the prior year. This was driven by a 35% increase in revenues. Our Rialto business segment that Jeff talked about, generated operating earnings of $7.7 million, and again, this number is net of $13.4 million of net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest. As you remember, we have to consolidate the FDIC transaction, and this compares to $5.7 million in the prior year. Let me go through the composition of Rialto's $7.7 million of operating earnings by type of investment. Our PPIP investment contributed $16 million of earnings, and this includes profits from interest income, sale of securities and management promote fees. Our first Rialto Real Estate Fund contributed $6.2 million of earnings this quarter. The FDIC transactions had a $7.8 million loss during the quarter. The non-FDIC portfolios had $0.5 million loss and these amounts were reduced by approximately $6.2 million of general and administrative expenses and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $6.7 million. The $7.8 million FDIC loss was due to impairments during the quarter. Each quarter, we review all the cash flows in the FDIC deal, and due to some changes in timing and reduction in cash flows, we recorded $20 million of impairments in the FDIC portfolios with our share totaling approximately $8 million. Rialto continues to generate strong cash flow. At quarter end, the FDIC debt, net of cash available in the defeasance account and in Rialto's cash account, was $211 million. As Stuart highlighted, we have been focusing on recycling capital invested in Rialto back to Lennar. And in the third quarter, we returned approximately $70 million from the PPIP and this now reduces Lennar's total investment in Rialto to approximately $530 million. Turning to taxes. This quarter, we reversed $44 million of the remaining $177 million deferred tax asset reserve, and we continue to believe most of the remainder will reverse by the end of 2013. We expect there will be enough reversal of the DTA reserves in Q4 to offset any tax expense. Our balance sheet liquidity improved in the third quarter with $692 million of cash and no outstanding borrowings under our $525 million 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility. The committed portion of the facility has been increased to $500 million subsequent to quarter end. We continued our balance sheet strategy of pushing out debt maturities while reducing our cost of capital as we raised $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due 2017 and simultaneously tendered for $205 million of 5.95% notes due 2013. We took a charge of $6.5 million relating to the successful tender in the coming quarter. Let me turn it open for questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMC.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question on the margins, they continue to surprise on the upside, the gross margins, as well as the SG&A leverage. You're at 11% roughly this quarter, kind of bumping up against what you would kind of consider normal versus the previous cycle. I know you've discussed perhaps gross margins, maybe moving into the mid-20s over the next couple of years. Is that still your view? And how do you think about "normalized operating margins" in the next 2, 3 years?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, Mike, we're really holding short of looking too far ahead and projecting future sales, deliveries and margins. And I think that we don't -- we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves or encourage anybody to get ahead of where we are. What we are seeing is strength in our numbers. We have an improving environment that is yielding increased pricing, but also increased cost. We've made some very important strategic land acquisitions. We have some mothballed communities coming back online. There are a number of positives, but we're still working through an uneven kind of recovery. So I don't want to answer the question by guiding to a gross margin range. But as we sit here today, the outlook is fairly positive with increased volumes and a good strategic position.
Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: All right, I appreciate that. Second question, mortgage approval process has stabilized and even marginally has begun to get better. We actually saw last week, we were with another builder that pointed to actually a new mortgage product out there, which is the first we've heard in some time. I was wondering if you could elaborate on your remarks in terms of either if you're seeing either new mortgage products out there or the approval process, elaborate on how it's getting better, either from a paperwork standpoint perhaps or just the standards overall.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, let me take that, Mike. As we highlighted, first of all, from the mortgage approval process, appraisals have been -- appraisers have been cooperating with the price increases that we've been seeing coming through. So that's been helpful in the process in terms of the mortgage approval process for the full amount of what we're selling the homes for. We're seeing people coming out of the penalty boxes for some of the short-selling foreclosures, where they were put aside until they eliminated that. Income levels have been improving, and in general, we're seeing the trend positive in terms of approval percentages. And I don't know, Rick, if you want to add anything to that.
Richard Beckwitt: No, I think it's just been that we're seeing quality buyers out there that really want to execute. The process has gotten more streamlined of recent and things are going in the right direction. So still tough, but definitely gotten much better over the last quarter or so.
Operator: And the next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: It's actually Alan on for Ivy. First question is just on the corporate G&A. I know you highlighted in the press release that there was an increase there from some increasing share based in variable comp. Is there any color you can give us on how to kind of think about that going forward? I know you indicated it's about 2.9% of revenues. Is that kind of a good bogey to use? Or should we think about that maybe as a percentage of EBITDA or share price or some other way that we can kind of model that going forward?
Stuart A. Miller: Sure, Alan. This quarter, because of the success we had with the bottom line, that ties directly into the way that we're compensating our management team, which is bottom line profitability. So the variable compensation expense is what drove the majority of the corp G&A increase. And then we also -- this quarter, there were some shares that were issued as well so that there was some share-based compensation expense that hit as well. I do want to tell you that there's still been tremendous focus on G&A at both the corporate and the field level, and we think there's going to be leverage as our volume picks up, but there is a component that's tied to the bottom line profitability with the variable comp expense. As far as an exact percentage, we came from the low 1%, so I think we're at 2.9% now. I think, over time, as volume picks up, that percentage should come down because a lot of that corporate G&A expense is not tied to volume increasing or profitability growing. So I do think we'll get leverage. I don't have an exact percentage to give you right now, but I think over time, we'll continue to migrate down off of that 2.9% going forward.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Great, that's helpful. And on the Financial Services side on the mortgage business, can you give us any color on the composition or types of refi loans that you're doing today? Where are those loans generally sourced from? And does the composition in terms of split between FHA, GSEs, LTVs, are they similar to your purchase out in the Homebuilding business? Or is there any difference there?
Bruce E. Gross: There's a lower percentage of FHA/VA as you're looking at the refi business. I don't have the exact percent on the refi business. Our FHA percentage came down this quarter. If you look at it, combined FHA/VA down to about 53%, and of that 53%, FHA was 37% and VA was about 16% of that 53% number. So the sourcing of that business, it's being sourced by our loan consultants in the field. As you remember, we had a company called Eagle Mortgage that we combined into Universal American Mortgage, and we have loan consultants around the country that are focused in driving that business.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Any difference in terms of LTVs or anything, FICO scores, credit quality?
Bruce E. Gross: No, I wouldn't say that there's a lot of difference other than as far as LTV, in a refinance, you're going to have a lower LTV than you will because you're going to have less FHA business, less purchase business. So we're dealing with highly qualified buyers, FICO scores and credit quality remains high. Those people that are able to refinance do have good credit today.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just wanted to ask you a question with respect to your pricing power that you're beginning to see. Obviously, some of that is a broad statement about the market, but also, you've done a number of things operationally that are kind of company-specific as well. Notably, some of your product offerings are a bit different from your peers. I was wondering if you've done an analysis on the degree to which you believe some of the shifts you've made or the difference, I guess, that exists in your product offering versus your peers, think of things like Next Gen and your Everything's Included and so forth, to what degree that may have led you to enjoy better price appreciation than the broader market.
Richard Beckwitt: Well, there's no question good product sells for a higher price and we've been very successful in introducing new plans. Our Next Gen plans, The Home Within a Home have been selling incredibly well and commands a premium in the marketplace. Our EI packages, our EI platform is doing extremely well, too, especially in an environment where you've got labor issues in order to get things built. They're easier to build, they're faster to build. We take the confusion out of the selection process, and as a result, we command very decent pricing for that. We've instituted price increases across the board, and the good news is they're sticking and we've been consistently pushing prices up, really, every month. We don't want to kill the momentum out there, but at the same point in time, we're very focused on the bottom line right now.
Stuart A. Miller: Yes, just let me add to that. The pricing side of the equation is not the only part that product is instrumental in driving. Just as Rick was talking, relative to our EI platform, we've consistently said that EI enables not only an easier and more orderly program for construction, but it also helps us contain the natural trend upward in construction costs. And so while pricing is kind of reverting to normal and is kind of moving up, so, too, are costs, and our EI platform, our product strategy, is really helping us to contain that by keeping a simple program in the field and a consistent kind of SKU purchase that enables us to negotiate costs a little bit better.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. Rick, I noticed you didn't actually give me any numbers to work with, but that's all right, and follow up later. Following up, though, Stuart, on your comments there about efficiency, I mean, that really touched on something that I think folks are going to be wrestling with over the next couple of years. There's a general presumption in the market that the builders -- that Homebuilding doesn't really lend itself to economies of scale. And certainly, all the things that you've been talking -- you just talked about would seem to argue that there are. I think it's going to be one of the major determinants of just how high your operating margin can get this cycle. And so in that regard, I was thinking -- I've been thinking about the evolution of the business over the last 10 years or so, and it seems to me that the business has been -- has seen the opportunity to extract economies of scale through the use of management technology and information technology and information sharing across regions in a way that didn't exist 15 years ago. But at the peak of the market, you guys were so frenzied that my sense is that you really didn't have the opportunity to fully explore those opportunities. And so this upturn is really the first period where we're going to actually see the potential to extract economies of scale that have been made available through improvements in information sharing and so forth across regions. Do you agree with that general view? And if so, could you give us some sense, not just of what you're doing now, but what you were doing now that you couldn't do before at the peak of the cycle to give us some sense of where operational efficiency may lead to higher margins?
Richard Beckwitt: This is Rick, and then I'll flip it over to Jon. Just a couple of examples and maybe to back up, during the depths of the market decline, it was a tough experience for all of us, but it gave us an opportunity to completely restructure the way we do business. We went from purchasing materials in every division to centrally locating our regional operating centers. So right now, we've got 3 instead of 27 or 30 purchasing centers. And the visibility that we have across the country is just tremendous, Steve. Another example of it is that during the downturn, we were able to de-bundle labor and materials. We were purchasing things in the heat of the market on a turnkey basis, and now we've separated those 2 things into different cost components. Once you start doing that, it's tough for the trades to get back into a turnkey type of program. But those are some examples of how things that we've done during the downturn, things we're focused on continuing today that give us an incredible amount of operating leverage as things start to grow. Jon, any other thoughts?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Sure. Steve, the unbundling point that Rick mentioned tied together with software and technology enabled us to do takeoffs and estimates of our plans much faster than we're able to before, really gives us a clarity into the details of purchasing that we didn't have before. And when things are moving very fast, it's hard to implement those. When things were slower, we were able to implement those. And I think as things continue to pick up, that will pay off from our ability to really track material usage and shift materials quickly when we need to. And then on a pure sort of technology side, today, we have rolled out iPads in the field and our construction managers are able to communicate very quickly with architects and engineers, find solutions, communicate information. Those things that used to take a couple of days perhaps can now get solved in a matter of minutes, and all those will add to our efficiency.
Stuart A. Miller: So kind of direct answer, we're kind of thinking, as we look ahead, that there will be economies of scale that reveal themselves in this recovery differently than we've seen in the past. It is a combination of technology and the adjustments that we've made to our operating platform. And all of this dovetails very well with our Everything's Included operating program.
Operator: The next question is coming from Steve East, ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Stuart, if we stay on the cost a little bit, could you just give us an idea of what type of inflation you're seeing right now coming through your balance sheet -- or your income statement and just sort of rank order between the material costs or labor costs and the land inflation? And then looking at the land, what you're trying to buy now, Rick? You talked a lot about it. What type of inflation are you seeing in land on a year-over-year basis?
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, Steve, Jon reviewed a couple of those construction concepts. I'm going to toss it over to him and then Rick will come back on the land side.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: When you look at what's happening with the material cost, you've seen the biggest increase in lumber where that represents about 7.5% of our construction spend and you've seen that go up anywhere in the 20%, 25% range, and then you go down to other materials that most of them represent 2% or 3% of the total spend. And in total, I think we've seen probably about a 5% increase. And because that represents about 42% of our sales price, it doesn't have a big impact if any one item goes up on our margins.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, and then on the land side of that equation?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, Steve, one thing to keep in mind as you look at us and you think about the land, a lot of the stuff that we're purchasing today was put under contract a year, 2 years, 3 years ago. And so it's coming on balance sheet at prices that are sub where market is today. The things we're contracting for today, if they're finished homesites, that's immediate, that's a retail type of purchase and we're still able to command 20% gross margins in that kind of stuff. Prices are up over a year or 2 ago, maybe 5% to 10% in various cases, but you've got to keep in mind that those are high ROI deals that move very quickly, so your operating leverage is tremendous if you can get good finished homesites. As far as the raw land deals that we're doing right now, there's still a shortage of folks out there that are pursuing those because there's different philosophies as to whether you want to internally develop or buy from other folks. We've been very, very aggressive in purchasing all throughout the continuum of the land curve. I've said it before, we are, I think, the best land company out there. And you've seen some of the jobs we've brought on, Steve. It's tremendous.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, I appreciate that. That's helpful. And then if we look at -- Stuart, just sort of looking at your segments and geographically, the comparative nature of your business, what's going on and what you're seeing and then just an update on your second fund in Rialto, where you stand with it.
Stuart A. Miller: Well, relative to the second fund in Rialto, because we're in the -- we're in a quiet period relative to that fund, I really can't comment on that. The one thing I will comment on in that regard is fund 1, as Jeff reported, is really performing at a very high level. We can -- we have continued to generate an extraordinary pipeline of potential deals, and that continues to enable us to invest very attractively the remaining funds in fund 1, and it leaves for us a nice backlog of opportunities that are already identified and in line to begin fund 2 as it is raised. I really can't give any color beyond that. And the first part of your question was?
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Just looking at geographically and maybe price point segment, how -- what you're seeing across the country.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, I just want to highlight that, that was a compound question, was unrelated, so we noticed that.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: I was trying to slip the fund 2 in there.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, I know the shoehorn. In any case, relative to -- regionally, I've highlighted that the recovery of market is pretty much across the country right now, but it's pocketed. And we continue to see pockets of strength in all of the major markets across the country and it's kind of expanding from there. So I really wouldn't -- I wouldn't highlight one region versus another as being -- as kind of outperforming. We do see strength in places like Florida and some of the Eastern Seaboard markets. In California, some of the markets are coming back stronger than others. In terms of price point, we still see a trend in favor of move-up purchasers. The lower end is still a little bit more constrained. But there is a recovery going on in a broad-based way across the country. It's just very pocketed and very locally focused.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: I wonder if you could clarify, of the 124,000 owned/controlled lots, what percent of those are owned? I think, last quarter, it was 100,000. And the kind of the breakdown of your finished lots versus your mothballed lots.
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. Out of the 124,000, Ken, about 106,000 are owned and the rest are controlled. And as far as the mothballed homesites -- I'm sorry, the finished homesites, you asked, finished homesites, let me give you a dollar amount because we don't typically break out the number as far as homesites go. Finished homesites have been running about $540 million as far as a pure finished homesite. Now if a homesite is in progress, construction in progress, there'll be a component of finished homesites included in our CIP as well. That's not right [ph].
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: So what I find interesting is, I think, given your 8,000 purchases this quarter, if my math's right, you've done about 48,500 lots since the -- in the last 3 years, which should be 1/2 of your owned inventory. Can you describe, just to be clear, your community count of 444, does that include just owned or is that owned and auctioned? And how does that kind of work out as you open up your mothballed communities next year? What's the kind of margin you're seeing on those?
Bruce E. Gross: Let me just highlight the way that we call an active community. Anytime a community has 5 or more homes to sell and it's actively selling, we call it an active community and that's what makes up the 444 number that Rick gave you.
Richard Beckwitt: So if we're not building in a community and don't have an ongoing sales presence, construction activity, it's not in our community count. The second question was on the 25% of the...
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Right. What the incremental -- to the extent you're saying your new lots were coming in at 200 basis points above your benchmark, how are you seeing the mothballed component come on?
Richard Beckwitt: It's pretty much in that line. The new things are about 200 basis points higher than the overall average for the company. As we bring in the legacy or inactive communities, it starts off a little slow because we want to build momentum, then, generally, we bring pricing back up. You got to keep in mind that we hung onto these communities for a good reason because we knew the markets would come back, we took appropriate value hits on the assets and we don't want to start selling them too cheap, so we're waiting for the appropriate time to bring them on board.
Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: And what percent of the mothballed is represented in these new openings next year?
Richard Beckwitt: I don't have that with me right now.
Operator: The next question is coming from Joshua Pollard, Goldman Sachs.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: The first one was, in your prepared remarks, you said that there was a little bit more visibility in planning your business. Can you talk specifically about what you guys are expecting for next year in terms of community absorption rate? I think it was 3.2 this quarter versus 2.2 last year. You're talking about 40% growth just on that metric. That's before you start getting in the community count. So could you talk a little bit about what you're expecting there and also what you guys are looking for in terms of price increases and whether or not the 8% in your backlog is a good precursor?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, Josh, we kind of knew that, that remark might spur this kind of question. We're really not ready to start going out and giving too much forward-looking guidance, and we're still keeping our view fairly short, recognizing that we are in the initial stages of recovery. What we're really seeing is a sense of consistency starting to present itself. And so as we look ahead, rather than that very rocky bottom that we endured for quite a long period of time, we're starting to see a lot of consistency in our quarter-over-quarter movements and are able to do some better planning around that, expecting that we're likely to see more consistency going forward and kind of more stability in the way things look ahead rather than saying that we're going to get out over our skis and start projecting. So we're not really giving guidance as we go ahead, but we are saying that we do have a good sense that the market, as we look over the next quarters, is likely to show some consistent trends with what we've been seeing.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Stuart, that brings up an interesting question. Back in '05 when I first picked up this group, the entire group used to give guidance. What things do you guys need to see before you'll start feeling a level of confidence to give guidance to investors again?
Stuart A. Miller: Oh boy, I'm going to let Bruce answer that.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Sorry, Bruce. I was leaving that one for Stuart.
Bruce E. Gross: Yes, look, as we go forward, I think we'll have to look at the environment as we go, but we've given some guidance with gross margin as we've had stability. You don't have the land impairments that we've had to deal with. We're seeing the ability to raise prices, so we've given some level of our thoughts on gross margin. As far as activity going forward, I think when there's more clarity as to how many of the communities are actually coming out and whether the sales -- how much the sales pace might be changing, it will be a lot easier for us to give guidance because there's so much operating leverage, the volume's going to drive a lot of what we might guide. So I think we're going to look at this again very closely. We're in the middle of our planning season. And with the next quarterly conference call, after we come out of the planning season, we're going to be discussing what kind of metrics we can give for next year.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, sounds good. Last question, around your gross margins, you said 200-basis-point spread between your newer land and your older land at 23.5%, that simply says 24.5% and 22.5%. But what I'm trying to understand is how low are you guys willing to go on high turnover, high returns, land? What are the gross margin metrics? And how low are you guys willing to go on that metric? And then I want to understand if your mothballed land, because of the write-downs, end up at the higher end of that spectrum or at the lower end because I think it's somewhere in the middle. Mothballed, you guys could have taken a lot of write-downs versus it being older land, and I'm not sure if mothballed land is something that we should be thinking of as additive to gross margins or a bit of a detractor.
Stuart A. Miller: Well, that's a lot of questions within one. You tricky guy, you. Okay, with regard to the finished lot or finished homesite opportunities that are high ROI and lower grosses, I don't want to really give you a number for competitive reasons as to where I would draw that threshold because that gets into overall strategy. But what I can tell you is that we -- depending on the number of communities, the proximity of that community to another community that we're operating in, Josh, we'd be willing to work with a lower margin because the overhead, the incremental overhead is de minimis. So if we're drawing that line from an underwriting standpoint at basically 20%, which is what the basic threshold is across the country today, it would be below that, but not much, all right? With regard to the margin and the gross margins in our mothballed communities, I tell you that there'd be some that are high and there'll be some that are below. All of them have been appropriately impaired. But as you have some things that were mothballed, there could be some just A locations in there that we chose to not bring online because we knew that the market would be really strong at some point down the road and that we'd be selling them too cheap. Those would be infill locations that we just decided to sit on.
Operator: The last question is coming from Steve Stelmach, FBR.
Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Just real quick, 2 questions, one on the FDIC impairment. I know earlier I inferred maybe you guys mentioned sort of a political process slowing our seats on some of those issues. The ID audit [ph], I believe, was due in August. Did that have any impact on that $20 million impairment? Or was that completely a separate -- entirely separate evaluation on your part?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: No, and this is Jeff. No impact, totally separate.
Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. Did you see the results of that? I know you guys have been a long, strong partner with the FDIC and this seemed more politically driven than FDIC-driven but...
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: We have not seen -- I personally have not seen the final report yet. It may have been issued, but I have not seen it yet. I did see a draft.
Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Got it, okay. And then the second question goes back to the economies of scale question. When I think about your operating business, I think of it more -- the operating leverage more in terms of your land acquisition strategy, your balance sheet financing leverage. Economies of scale, while positive incremental, is that more of a secondary and tertiary issue versus the others? How should I think about that?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: The operating scale is actually a very big issue. To the extent that you bring on additional communities or you bring on additional sales per community, the incremental overhead that you have by bringing on a new community is basically the builder that you have in that community, the cost of the model in that community and the variable sales commissions associated with the sale. To the extent that you can add a community that will generate 100 closings in a year, that's a lot of money that pumps down to the bottom line. So the revenue associated with that allows us to spread the overhead across all the units.
Stuart A. Miller: I think the kind of metric that we kind of think about is that when you add absorption per community, you're only adding about 4% of SG&A. When you add a new community, an additional community, whether it's a retail developed homesite community or otherwise, you're adding about an incremental 7%, 7% to 8%, and that compares to where we are right now at 12%. So that's where you're seeing your operating leverage is, either in increasing absorption or increasing the number of communities with an already existing division. That's -- and it works in combination with all of those other factors, sales price and otherwise.
David M. Collins: Okay, great. So that will wrap up our third quarter conference call. We look forward to reporting back as we close out our year end and look forward to a continuation of recovery in the housing market. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

These factors include those described under the caption Risk Factors contained in Lennar's annual report on Form 10-K most recently filed with the SEC. Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Thank you.
Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2012 update. We're very pleased to detail our results for you this morning, and we have a lot of ground to cover. As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment are here to participate as well, and of course, you just heard from Allison Bober. I'm going to begin this morning with some brief opening remarks about the state of the current housing market in general and about our second quarter results, and then Rick and Jon will comment on specific aspects of Lennar's Homebuilding operations. And Jeff will update performance on our Rialto segment. David Collins is going to also give a 5-minute primer on our deferred tax asset reversal. And finally, Bruce will provide detail on our first quarter numbers. After Bruce, of course, we'll open the phone lines to your questions. [Operator Instructions] So as I sit here today, I couldn't be more pleased with the progress that our company has made and continues to make as we work through this historic downturn. The associates throughout our company have worked tirelessly to pull through the toughest of times to revamp our business from top to bottom and to move forward to stable profitability. The reversal of our deferred tax asset reserve this quarter is really a tacit recognition of a job well done, and it's symbolic of having accomplished a great deal to bring Lennar back to a strong go-forward position. And in that regard, I want to thank all of the associates of our company for their commitment and care, which are at the core of the culture of our company. The reversal of our deferred tax asset reserve this quarter is, as I noted before, really symbolic rather than a significant financial event. It represents that the company has really achieved a stabilized financial condition, consistent profitability and even a modicum of visibility as well. It also represents that the macro housing market has stabilized, has most likely bottomed and perhaps is beginning the road to recovery. I've noted over the last few quarters that we've been seeing consistent improvement in both traffic and demand activity in our communities. This has acted as confirmation that both the housing market and the overall economy are stabilizing and that a very real trend is beginning to take shape. The overall housing market is different now than it has been in the past several years. There are discernible, fundamental shifts that are driving the home market, and there are empirical data points that are, to date, confirming the market is really showing signs of stability. With that said, and as we saw from yesterday's Case-Shiller information and last week's home sales data, the housing market is not yet in full recovery as the actual data is still slightly negative in some instances. In fact, the stabilization process after a full 7-year decline in housing is still somewhat rocky and erratic and is certainly not yet broad-based. Our management team has just completed our quarterly operations review with all of our division presidents. Let me tell you what we're seeing in the field and how we're thinking about the market versus national numbers that are being reported. We're seeing that various important themes are primary drivers of today's housing market. First, today's consumers looking at the home purchase differently than in past years. Today's buyers are looking for real value as defined by low purchase price, low interest rate and affordable and competitive monthly payments. The home purchase is not seen as a place to invest savings in order to ride the wave of price increases. Since home prices and volumes are low and interest rates are at historic lows, affordability is at extremely high levels. Today's consumers are realizing that housing represents an undeniable value proposition. They are finding real value in today's for-sale housing, and we're hearing this from them regularly in the field. Accordingly, for the past few quarters now, we've been experiencing more traffic in our Welcome Home Centers, and customers are actively discussing their desire to find a way to purchase and capitalize on current market conditions. A second trend is that purchasers are beginning to feel pressure to make the home purchase so that they do not miss this moment in time. The feeling of missing the boat is becoming a common discussion and is being reinforced by discussion with family and friends. Buying a home -- buying and owning a home is not only no longer taboo at the dining room table, it is being viewed as a measure of financial stability again. This trend will continue to drive demand and sentiment as more data becomes positive as the press continues to highlight recovery and as inventory in the field continues to deplete. Next, consumers are becoming acutely aware of the comparative value in monthly payments and a mortgage monthly payment versus a rental monthly payment. The fully loaded cost of ownership is simply lower in most desirable markets than comparable rental rates. As I've noted in past conference calls, we have and continue to carefully study this trend and continue to find that in local competitive markets, principal interest, taxes, insurance, community, association and lawn care are together lower than the competitive rental market. Today, for-sale housing represents an excellent value proposition on a pure monthly payment basis versus renting. Rental prices are high, and they've been moving up as well. Today's consumer is looking for living cost stability, as well as a stable and safe place to raise the family. Accordingly, today's housing consumer is seeking to avoid the rental market and the annual repricing inherent in rental rates. Fourth, consumers recognize that the mortgage approval process is extremely conservative and it is very difficult to get approved. Expectations are aligning with the new realities of the mortgage market, and consumers desirous of purchasing and getting approved are becoming more realistically in touch with their own credit credentials in order to be approved. Rather than fighting the process and leaving in frustration, consumers are working within today's parameters to provide the burdensome paperwork, accumulate the required money down and enhance their credit credentials to get to the finish line. Fifth, inventories are declining. While there might be national statistics that suggest otherwise or suggest that foreclosure backlog and delinquencies are still a looming problem, we are finding that inventory overhang is diminishing in many markets and that available for-sale housing is becoming more scarce. Additionally, with the government's recasting of HARP 2.0, that is the home refinance program for performing but underwater loan, there are far fewer strategic defaults as more owners are refinancing and appreciating a lower monthly payment. Finally, improvement in employment and consumer confidence is finally translating into the end of negative household formation. The trend of children moving home and elderly parents moving in with children is at least slowing and starting to reverse. Over time, this trend will be an even more powerful driver of demand. I have always noted that it is generally 6 to 12 months after households double up that everyone realizes that this was just not a good idea. As the economy improves, doubled-up households can afford to unwind, and this is beginning to happen. Overall, demand has been improving, and we've seen consistent sales pace at stabilized prices through our second quarter as a continuation of a trend from our prior quarters. Our steady traffic and sales rate indicate stronger demand trends than prior years, and we have seen an increase in our monthly sales per community as well. And these improved results are coming with prices and margins that are consistent or marginally better than our current deliveries, indicating that we are not and have not been reaching for volume. With these trends identified, I do not want to overstate the case for housing. While the trend is discernibly positive, stabilization and recovery are uneven across the country and even within markets. The housing depression was a national phenomenon, while the recovery is decidedly very local. We're seeing pockets of activity develop across the country not by region or by state but on a very localized basis. And these pockets are recovering while the broader market outside of these pockets often remains weak. But at present, these pockets are growing. Additionally, demand remains constrained by the mortgage qualification standards and processes and a difficult appraisal environment that define today's mortgage market that has been overcorrected by the severity of the downturn. But demand is growing, and more and more customers are pushing to fit within the boundaries of credit standards while the government has recognized that the pendulum has swung too far and is pushing for some loosening of credit standards as well. Let me briefly turn to Lennar specifically as our management team will give additional color on our results. In our second quarter, we saw fundamental improvement in all of the building blocks that define our Homebuilding and Financial Services operations, while Rialto continued to build and augment its blue-chip operating platform. Each of our operating segments has remained profitable in the second quarter as our associates across the country are executing on all fronts. On the homebuilding front, closings were up 20%. New orders increased 40%. Our backlog improved 61%, and gross margins of 22.5% translated into our healthy operating margin of 9.2% as SG&A declined to 13.2%. We're beginning to see the impact of the operating leverage that we expected as the market stabilizes. As we look ahead to future quarters, our strategy of focusing on high margins in well-positioned communities will continue to be the primary engine that drives SG&A operating leverage that will continue to produce strong and sustainable bottom line earnings. Lennar's Homebuilding operations are operating soundly and are defined by excellent hands-on management running the day-to-day activities, while excellent new communities are identified and added to each division. Lennar Financial Services had another excellent quarter as well, leveraging the core Homebuilding business, providing excellent service to our customers and adding incremental volume by participating in the refinance market as well. In the second quarter, Rialto continued to be a central part of the improving Lennar story. While current earnings of $4.3 million fell short of our expectations, the contribution that our Rialto connections and relationships have made to our core Homebuilding business has exceeded every expectation we had when we began to grow this business. In this regard, I have to highlight the credible work of Eric Feder, who has been the bridge between Rialto and Lennar managers and has maximized the synergy. The Rialto franchise will continue to be a significant source of valuable homebuilding deals for some time to come, while the base Rialto business ramps its earnings. As we look ahead, Rialto should continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will begin to return cash to corporate as it is now investing self-generated funds. I would be remiss if I did not briefly address the recent press coverage on a financing deal with a Chinese bank on our Hunters Point and Treasure Island partnerships. While we do not comment on deals that are in negotiation or not closed, I will say that we have a great number of very exciting dealings around various strategic assets that will reveal themselves over time. Of course, we will make material announcements as appropriate. All in all, our second quarter 2012 results mark an excellent stepping stone to our future performance. We're feeling more and more comfortable that the current trend is not an aberration but the beginning of a new cycle for housing. This sense derives from extensive feedback from our people in the field and from the nature of the shift in the consumers' mindset. As I look ahead to the remainder of this year and towards 2013, I am increasingly optimistic that we are seeing a real bottom in housing and that we will continue to see signs of recovery. National statistics and news will give us some mixed signals as we move through the year as they represent a compendium of all of the best and the worst markets around the country. But I feel that stabilization and recovery will emanate from the most desirable markets and spread outward over time. Lennar is positioned with a strong balance sheet, is in the right markets with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions continue to improve. All of the segments of our company are performing well and are extremely well positioned, as you will now hear from our operating team. Rick?
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. We are really pleased with our operating results this quarter. These results were driven by both the well-executed land acquisition strategy and a fine-tuned homebuilding machine. I'm going to review our land activities and explain why Lennar is positioned to succeed in today's land market. Jon is then going to discuss our building activities and how we maximize our gross and operating margins. During the first quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring or auctioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. This quarter, we purchased 4,561 homesites for $206 million, and we spent $81 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 74% over the prior-year period. In addition, we signed option contracts to acquire 1,597 homesites. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 29% of our land purchases in the second quarter are located in the mid-Atlantic, 23% in the West, 22% in Texas, 14% in Florida, 7% in the Pacific Northwest, with the remaining 5% spread throughout our other markets. The lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of a competitive bid environment and were relationship-based deals. As in prior quarters, money was invested geographically in the markets where we saw the best opportunities. In Q2, we continue to acquire great deals in Florida and Texas but invested more heavily in some extremely high-margin opportunities in California and the mid-Atlantic. You will continue to see quarter-to-quarter changes in the geographic mix of our land purchases as we capitalize on the best opportunities out there. While the land market has heated up recently, our pipeline of land that we're actively negotiating is robust. More importantly, over the last several quarters, we put under contract or letter of intent over 24,000 homesites that have yet to close. And you should note that since these homesites are still in the diligence process, that they are not included in our homesite owned or controlled total that I will give you later. Consistent with our prior land purchases, these land deals have been underwritten to exceed a 20% gross margin and a 20% IRR with no inflation. To date, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of our new communities. During the second quarter, approximately 48% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put under contract during the last 3 years. Our gross margins on closings in these communities was approximately 200 basis points higher than the gross margin for the entire company in the second quarter. By this point, it should be clear that we've invested wisely. The numbers truly speak for themselves. And as the housing markets recover, we believe we will continue to outperform the industry given our expertise in land acquisition. Let me explain why we will continue to be successful and how we are different from our competition. Number one is sourcing. We are fishing in a different pond. We have created many deep-rooted relationships with banks and other local sellers that provide us access to deals that are not on the open market. Number two is speed. We move quickly to assess, analyze and respond to new opportunities. We digest information quickly, and we have a streamlined approach to tying up a deal. We respond immediately to contract issues and can get a deal signed faster than anyone else. We are business people and don't let our lawyers control the deal. Expertise. Our key land associates have the knowledge and ability to negotiate complex deals. We do not shy away from complicated deal structures. We have the financial strength of a large company but the agility and expertise of sophisticated private investors. We are not a big bureaucratic organization where the deal needs to fit within a box. Fourth is credibility. Our due diligence process is systematic, thorough and effective. We commit to understanding the issues while we're pursuing the deal. Thus, when we sign a contract, we very rarely have to renegotiate because we took time to understand the facts and nuances of the deal upfront. This no re-trade credibility has given us the reputation of a company that gets deals done. In turn, we have become a preferred buyer. Fifth is persistence. When we identify a deal, we will pursue it until there's absolutely no chance that we will not get it. We do not accept the first "no" as an answer, and we will relentlessly pursue the deal, constantly reviewing whether there is an alternative deal structure that can turn the "no" into a "maybe" and ultimately a "yes." Sixth is performance. Our consistent operating performance gives us the ability to engage sellers at a different level. Our execution in opening communities and driving traffic, as well as our product selection and EI platform, differentiates us from other builders. This tends to give us a first look at deals and often makes us a perfect builder in a multi-builder community. And seventh is Rialto. We buy more than just land. We have the expertise to buy assets that will turn into land such as CDD bonds and bank notes and mortgages. This provides us a constant stream of high-margin opportunities. No other homebuilder has this depth of experience. Let me give you a few examples of how these factors have positioned us to succeed. Recently, another public builder signed a deal with a local developer for the first phase of homesites in a very large multi-phase community. Through our Rialto connection, we learned that a bank owned other homesites in the community, and we approached the developer to jointly purchase these homesites. As partners in a very small piece of the community and with 24/7 access to the developer, we built a close relationship with the developer and secured a key opportunity in the balance of this multiphase deal. The critical elements here were the Rialto connection, the relentless pursuit and creative approach to finding a way into a deal that someone else controlled, the relationship we built with the developer and the strong performance of the initial partnership. In another transaction, an out-of-state bank foreclosed on the last section of a very desirable community. They approached several buyers with a very complicated deal terms and a short diligence period. Many builders balked at the deal due to its complexity, while others, according to the bank, wasted a great deal of the bank's time trying to understand the issues. Our team was successful not because we paid top dollar, because we didn't. We got the deal done because we had the financial acumen and intellectual capacity to get it done quickly. As a result, we have positioned Lennar as the go-to company for deals in that market. My last example has to do with CDD bonds. On previous conference calls, I've described that we've actively pursued bond purchases as a way to back into underlying real estate. Because of the relationships we've developed over the last 2 years with the holders of the bonds, we're often contacted by them when they want to sell their positions. These positions tend to trade very quickly, and the purchase requires a unique knowledge of bonds, foreclosures and entitlements. We have this expertise in Rialto and in our Homebuilding divisions, so we can immediately react to these first-look opportunities. Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our Q2 inventory increased about $557 million to approximately $4.4 billion. And this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Sequentially, our inventory during Q2 increased about $145 million from Q1. At May 31, 2012, we owned and controlled 121,517 homesites and had 440 active communities. I'd like to turn it over to Jon.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Thank you, Rick, and good morning. As Stuart noted, we're very pleased with our second quarter results of a post impairment 22.5% gross margins and 9.2% operating margin. I will speak to how we continue to drive bottom line profitability through our management of pricing, product, direct costs and operating structure leverage. Our operational focus of balancing sales, price and pace starts by, first, stabilizing pricing, community by community. Then we focus on increasing the pace of sales, creating positive momentum. It is this momentum that enabled us to lower incentives and/or raise prices this quarter. This resulted in new orders of 4,481, improvement of 40% year-over-year and 48% sequentially over Q1. For the prior 4 quarters, sales were stabilized at 2.4 sales per community per month. This quarter, we increased our sales pace to 3.5 sales per month. Incentives were down to 10.7%, a year-over-year 140-basis-point improvement. This was primarily due to the improved rate of sales and a higher percentage of the homes sold prior to starting construction. Our backlog grew to 3,970 homes, up 61% year-over-year and 46% sequentially. With this rapid increase in our backlog, sold homes now represent 48% of total homes under construction. That, combined with a material increase in the number of pre-sold homes, we expect that our backlog conversion ratio will dip below 100% in Q3. Our newer communities with higher gross margins and absorption continue to capture a greater share of our deliveries and sales. However, one of the keys for our margin and absorption success this quarter was our focus on communities where the rate of sales was below the company average. We have a process in place where our divisions review detailed plans with senior management on strategies and tactics to improve the performance of these communities. Our product strategy continues to focus on the execution of our Everything's Included platform. Having the right product with a simplified home purchase process gives us a competitive edge, especially against resales and rentals. Our Everything's Included research has led us introduce a new product line this year, Lennar's Next Gen, The Home Within a Home. We introduced this product in the West and are now rolling it out across the country. We expect to be offering Next Gen plans in about 25% of our community by year-end. This home appealed to many buyer segments but predominantly the baby boomer who needs to take care of aging parents or boomerang kids. This product is without competition from resales and is producing strong gross margins and incremental sales for Lennar. This quarter, we continued to see urgency in customers making the buying decision, and raising prices helped create this urgency. Sales were very consistent throughout the quarter as only about 100 sales separated our biggest month from the smallest. We are seeing continued strength into June. On the mortgage front, we continue to face the challenging underwriting environment. Offsetting this is our consistent and close working relationship with UAMC. We see this benefit in our prequalification process, which led to our low 16% cancellation rate. Turning to the cost side of the equation. While there are some cost pressures materializing, we continue to believe that these increases will be offset by sales price improvements and our continued focus on managing direct costs. For 6 quarters running, our average direct costs remain in the range of $40 to $42 per square foot. As I have discussed on prior calls, we have an intense focus on lowering our cost while improving our quality. Our focus on Everything's Included not only delivers great value for the homebuyer but allows us to simplify everything from how we order materials to the flow on job sites. EI makes it easier to unbundle, giving us more transparency into our cost. It allows us to reduce SKUs, so our supplier have less to stock. And in those structural options, value engineering is enhanced because we do not have the need for multiple engineering solutions on each home. All of this helps skilled labor, too, as there are fewer change orders and greater consistency in field installation. We also continued our intense focus on managing extras in cost variances, working to eliminate these costs from the system. With our increased volume, we continued to leverage our operating structure. With deliveries up 20% year-over-year, our SG&A dropped to 13.2%, a 170-basis-point improvement. Once again, our approach is simplifying the homebuilding process centered around Everything's Included, enhances the overall leverage we're able to achieve. We continued to be extremely disciplined in controlling our indirect costs. We have in place a strong management team organized in a simple regional and divisional structure that allows for delivery growth with minimal additions to this structure. Across our divisions, we are actively and intensely managing each of the components that make up our net operating margin. I want to add my thanks to all of our associates for their hard work and focus in achieving our second quarter results. Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Rialto now has a focused team of over 200 professionals acquiring, resolving and adding value to distressed and advantageously priced real estate assets. We continue on the path to build a first-class investment and asset management company, which over the long haul, we expect will generate significant shareholder value. This quarter's earnings of $4.3 million for the Rialto segment are still not where we'd like to see them. This is mainly due to the timing of recoveries and higher expenses resulting from a number of borrowers and guarantors in our earlier distressed debt portfolios, taking obstinate positions about repaying their loans and bucking historical norms. More recently, we have seen this turn into an increased effort by a number of investor and developer obligors to alter existing laws to frustrate the original contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements, specifically to limit our ability to collect what is due. While we continue to be successful with our approach, including the use of the judicial process when necessary, the related higher costs must be expensed upfront, while revenue recognition is being delayed until later in the process. Nonetheless, operationally and from a cash flow perspective, we've made substantial progress on these portfolios, collecting over $650 million to date. And we've already repositioned almost $2 billion of loans into owned real estate. Of the original $627 million of FDIC seller financing, net of all cash on hand, it's now effectively down to approximately $240 million. All of our distressed debt investments since early 2011 have been made through our fund business where we had already recalibrated our thinking about the timing and cost of resolution. And we continue to materially exceed our original expectations on timing and amount of cash resolution. Our first $700 million real estate private equity vehicle, as well as our PPIP fund with AllianceBernstein, had another strong quarter contributing $12.2 million from our share of underlying earnings, plus fees and reimbursements. In addition, we have already started monetizing our investment in PPIP, selling almost $2 billion of face amount of securities since the last time we reported to you and repatriating over $22 million to the company of our $70 million investment. Our real estate fund has been able to acquire and tie up almost 40 different transactions, and their pipeline of new investments continues to be strong. We've already invested the lion's share of our funds' original equity commitments to acquire about $1.8 billion of assets, based on unpaid principal balance, for less than $0.40 on the dollar. And through the end of the quarter, the fund has already collected over $225 million from interest, principal and asset resolutions at levels significantly higher and sooner than originally anticipated, as well as from a groundbreaking nonperforming loan securitization, which has received a great deal of industry attention. Our fund and future investment vehicles should not only help to enhance the company's returns and add consistent cash flow and earnings but also will be important building blocks for us to create a strong investment management business. Along those lines, we're already earning fees from a number of sources, including the oversight of the fund in PPIP and from our loan workout and asset management activities. We also earn carried interest when we exceed targeted returns. In addition, last week, we received over first rating as a CMBS special servicer. We have already established Rialto as a leader in today's mortgage-backed securities marketplace. And for those of you remember what we did with LNR, we expect these activities to open up new opportunities for us to add further to our existing book of business. Perhaps the most significant and unexpected contribution that Rialto has added to the Lennar enterprise, though, is the invaluable access to borrowers and lenders that has contributed to the pipeline of deal flow that is driving our primary homebuilding business. As Rick and Stuart have indicated, direct access to distressed sellers has helped us source many advantageously priced land positions for the homebuilder. Together, we have worked to add over 10,000 new homesites across dozens of new Lennar communities in multiple markets and with a lot more in the pipeline. These are a few of the reasons why we remain excited about the continued progress of our Rialto franchise. Our ability to add new sources of solid business on our already existing management base, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar operations, we expect, in due course, will be reflected in growing value for our shareholders. Thank you. And David?
David M. Collins: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Stuart mentioned, we reversed $403 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2012. We came to this conclusion because the company determined that it was more likely than not that the majority of its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets would be utilized. The reversal of $403 million of our valuation allowance is presented as a benefit from income taxes in our income statement. The conclusion to reverse this amount was based on a detailed evaluation of all relevant evidence, both positive and negative, including such factors as our nonconsecutive quarters of earnings, the expectation of continued profitability, as well as the housing recovery we are experiencing in our markets. I will take a few minutes to explain the process we undertook to reach our conclusion. Historically each quarter, we have evaluated the relevant evidence regarding the DTA. Our analysis each quarter included a review of the overall housing market conditions, local market conditions and the company's actual results and financial projections. As of May 31, we concluded that there was sufficient, objectively, verifiable, positive evidence that outweighed the negative evidence and deemed that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our DTA in future periods. And as such, we reversed $403 million of the allowance. Among the factors we considered in our analysis were the following. We have had 9 consecutive quarters of profits with an expectation of continued profits. We were profitable across all of our businesses. Our operating leverage has improved significantly. Our year-to-date deliveries increased 24% year-over-year. Our year-to-date new orders increased 37% year-over-year. Our backlog increased 61% year-over-year. Housing starts have increased, and new home inventory is at an all-time low. We project to use our NOLs in the carryforward period, and we've had no history of NOLs expiring unused. The process that we undertook to reach our reversal conclusion was extensive and was reviewed by our independent external auditors, Deloitte & Touche. The reversal of $403 million of the DTA valuation allowance leaves a $177 million valuation allowance remaining at May 31. There are 2 components that make up the remaining valuation allowance of $177 million which, if the housing recovery continues, we expect most of the remaining allowance to reverse between Q3 2012 and Q4 2013. The first component. The accounting rules require a valuation allowance as being reversed in an interim period, such as our second quarter, to be partly applied to the remaining periods in the year. Therefore, we expect to reverse portions of the $177 million valuation allowance in Q3 and Q4 of 2012. These amounts should offset the tax expense we would have recorded in Q3 and Q4. Thus, we expect our net tax expense for the remainder of the year to be close to 0. The second component. We will also continue to provide a valuation allowance on a portion of our DTA relating to state NOLs. The reason for this is that the state tax laws for the most part do not allow for us to carry back NOLs. It's different for Federal tax purposes where we're able to carryback most of our Federal NOLs. We will evaluate the remaining amount relating to such state items each quarter. And if the housing recovery continues it is likely that most of the remaining allowance relating to our state NOLs will reverse between now and the end of fiscal 2013. With the reversal of most of our DTA valuation allowance, our stockholders' equity is now over $3 billion. Our net homebuilding debt to total capital improved to 46.9%, and our book value per share is up to $16.79. From an accounting standpoint, this is a significant milestone for our company. And now I'd like to turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, David, and good morning. I'll provide a little more color to the results, starting with Homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 23% to $796 million, driven by a 20% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 2% increase in average sales price to $250,000. The breakdown by region is as follows. The East region had an average sale price of $231,000, up 4%; Southeast Florida, $266,000, up 1%; Central Florida, $229,000, up 9%; Houston, $229,000, down 1%; the West region, $304,000, down 1%; and the other category, $321,000, down 17% due to product mix. Jon already highlighted the drivers of our strong gross margin performance and significant operating leverage during the quarter. The gross margins were strong in all of our regions this quarter, but they were strongest in the East and Southeast Florida regions. During the quarter, we had asset sales that were recognized in both the equity and earnings from unconsolidated subsidiary and other income lines. Although the joint venture asset sales resulted in a loss, the asset sales on the other income line had a profit. And combined, these 2 line items totaled $3.4 million of income in Q2, and that compares to $11.9 million in the prior year. Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $18 million versus $2.5 million last year. These are the strongest quarterly operating earnings for Financial Services since 2006. Mortgage pretax income increased to $17.2 million from $5.3 million in the prior year. This quarter's mortgage originations increased by 50% to $976 million. Our in-house mortgage capture rate of Lennar homebuyers was 77% this quarter. Originations with non-Lennar homebuyers increased 89% this quarter primarily due to an increase in the number of refinanced transactions as interest rates were under 4% for the quarter. Our title company had a $1.4 million profit in the quarter. And that compares with a loss of $2.2 million in the prior year as the volume of transactions increased by 39% this quarter. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings of $4.3 million. This number is net of $3.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, and that compares to $9.8 million in the prior year. The composition of Rialto's $4.3 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows. The FDIC portfolios had a $3.2 million gain; non-FDIC portfolios had a $1.3 million gain; PPIP contributed $2.7 million; and the Rialto Real Estate Fund contributed $3 million of earnings. And that was all less by $5.9 million of G&A and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $6.6 million. Our balance sheet liquidity improved in the second quarter with the completion of a $525 million 3-year unsecured revolving credit facility, of which $410 million was initially committed. As a result, our liquidity increased to $1.1 billion when adding our cash balance to the fully undrawn revolver. As David mentioned, our stockholders' equity increased significantly this quarter, which reduced our homebuilding net debt to total capital by 270 basis points. And our book value per share increased 17%, again, to $16.79. While it has not been customary for us to provide earnings guidance, I wanted to highlight a couple of items for the remainder of 2012. Our backlog conversion ratio, which has been running above 110% for the past few years, now with the large percentage of presales that Jon discussed and given the cycle time on these deliveries, a number of these homes will not close in the third quarter but rather in the fourth quarter. As a result, the backlog conversion ratio we expect for Q3 deliveries is between 85% and 90%. Additionally, we expect our gross margin percentage to range between 21% and 22.5% for the remainder of the year. With that, let's open up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to talk to you a little bit about your ability to raise prices as tempered by the appraisal process. We've been hearing ongoing concerns about appraisals, and yet, it does seem that just as buyers are able to get their financials in order in a better way than they were a year ago, builders are also finding ways to deal with a difficult appraisal process. I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing in the marketplace. Are you seeing any positive trends there? And what do you think it will take for the appraisals to take a significant step back in being a headwind for you?
Stuart A. Miller: Steve, we've discussed this topic, certainly, at our presidents' meeting. And look, here's the good news. The good news is that the appraisal process, appraisals in general, have really gotten in line with the market. And the pendulum has kind of swung closer to normal than it was 6 months ago. Six months ago, appraisals just at market prices were really driving prices lower. And I don't -- we don't get the sense that, that's as much the case out in the field today. Now with prices starting to move up, there's clearly some stickiness, and there's going to be a process of kind of finding equilibrium and the appraisers getting a sense. They'll probably lag the market and be a little bit more conservative in their approach, and we're hearing instances of this. But over time, we think it's going to find its way to a realistic setting. And I think on average, I'd say I feel pretty optimistic about the appraisal side of things, finding equilibrium maybe a little bit ahead of the mortgage side.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes. One thing I'd add to that, Steve, is that procedurally in the field, we raise it in small increments so it's easier to get the appraisal to get there. So it's tough to goose things by $5,000 or $10,000 in a month period. So you break it up into $1,000 to $2,500 increments. And we haven't seen a lot of resistance to that in the field.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, nor have I. And that's a great change of pace from where we were a year ago. Second question is, again, sort of a general question with respect to the issue of expectations. You all were fairly early in identifying a turn in the housing market at least in your communities. And we've seen increasingly people getting on board with that and echoing that. I was curious, though, if there were any pockets of the industry where you felt that expectations are perhaps getting a little ahead of where the market really is right now and where you think it is reasonable to expect it to be in the next 2 -- let's say, 1 to 2 quarters. So areas where people, you sense, may be being overly optimistic at this point maybe after having been a little bit slow to make that initial move, whether it be in the land side, in other areas of dealmaking, the mortgage side or anything that you're seeing in the marketplace.
Stuart A. Miller: Well, look, you highlight that we might have been a little bit earlier in reporting. I think that we're just, as a management group, very, very tightly connected with the field on a regular basis. And we're really just reporting very candidly the things that we're seeing, hearing and feeling as trends from the field. I think that it feels to us that right now, as I've said, it feels very much like we've hit a bottom and we're starting to come off of that bottom. I'm a little nervous about saying the word recovery. We'll see how things evolve over the next couple of quarters. And it will be easy for people to get a little bit ahead of the market. I don't think that there's reason for exuberance right now except for the fact that the beatings have stopped. But I think that we do have headwinds in the market, whether it's mortgage approvals, whether it's kind of remnant limitations from appraisals and prices moving up. I think that it would be easy for people to kind of get ahead of themselves in terms of the high point of home prices and where they can go quickly. I think that we're in for a steady recovery as one takes hold that is going to be slower than the V shape that people are used to. But at the same time, given the limitations on land, access to land and land availability, we are going to see, as the recovery does start to take hold, a move up in prices. So it's hard to say where people are getting ahead of themselves. I think it's a little bit too fresh. But I think that as in all recoveries, we are prone, as a group, to get a little ahead of ourselves. We're trying to keep things in check and stay very closely tied to the field.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Pollard of Goldman Sachs.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: My first question was actually for Jon. Can you walk through the progression of incentives per home, by month, over the course of the quarter and talk about where those incentive levels are in your backlog, ultimately trying to understand even if you guys can't push prices because of appraisal issues, how much further you guys have to cut on the incentive structure.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Josh, first, we don't break out our incentives and backlog to that level of detail. What we are seeing in the field is, I mean, this recovery is very localized. The downturn was very national, but as conditions improve in the field, it improves at different levels in different markets. So in some markets, we've been able to both reduce incentives fairly aggressively and even raise prices. In other markets, it's relatively flat and stabilized. But we are seeing that trend come down. Where a year ago we were about 12.5%. A year ago, we were at 12.5% in average sales price and incentives, and now we're down to 10.7%. We're seeing that steady decline, and I'd say that -- and it varies by area, but in the West, we'll probably see about 85% of our communities are able to achieve price or incentive improvement. And the Central is a little bit better than that, and on the East Coast, it's a little bit behind that.
Operator: The next question comes from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: My first question, Stuart, you talked about in the opening comments your feeling that there was someone in the government that kind of understood the issues around mortgage underwriting. And I'm wondering if you could just give us an idea of the political landscape in your mind now between the forces that are kind of pushing for tighter underwriting, especially for FHA/VA loans and the forces that say we need to kind of find a way to stimulate housing more through -- at a minimum kind of -- at a minimum don't tighten any more but maybe even loosen a little bit and kind of how your thoughts on how that's playing out, especially as it relates to the QM standard and underwriting as we go forward.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay. David, I'm not going to name names, but I will say that certainly within the government there has been over the past year a recognition and awareness that housing, really, is a central issue and key to a recovery within the economy. And I think you see that really on both sides of the aisle. It doesn't mean that there aren't some people that feel that more and more tightening is required, and you hear some of those sentiments come out. But the more people have come to understand that housing is a very important key to driving employment and driving psychology improvements or sentiment improvements among the consumer, who, by and large, own homes, the feeling among many legislators is that the pendulum has swung too far and that the mortgage process has become overly cumbersome and been driven past the point of being safe and secure. And there is beginning to be some pushback. I think that if you were to speak to the people within Fannie, Freddie, FHA/VA, there's kind of a balancing point, let's say, that kind of goes like, "Hey, let's keep things conservative enough. Let's not get back to 0-down mortgages. Let's have a healthy downpayment. But let's also recognize that we've probably made the paperwork overly cumbersome." The credit scores were probably that requiring too high of a credit score for what's reasonable. And in order to get banks lending again, I think that there's a sentiment that we have to ease up a little bit. The last thing I want to say is, as I remember, last week it was that I saw an article that noted that the FHFA is starting to reconsider the putback requirements relative to some of the banks as it relates to Fannie and Freddie loans. And that is a really good indicator that political currents are kind of moving in the direction of saying, "Hey, if we can resolve or create safe harbors relative to putback risk, then we're going to define the landscape for banks and enable them to make a more comfortable lending decision as they go forward." And I think that's as good of an indicator as I can point to that the political world is really starting to get an understanding that we've probably swung too far to the conservative side.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. And then just a follow-up. I think you guys did a great job on outlining what differentiates Lennar on the land front, the land acquisition front. And I was wondering if we could follow up and just think about the peer group that's also trying to pursue the same land opportunities. And if we kind of put Rialto to the side because clearly, that's a competitive advantage and very, very hard to replicate, I'm wondering about the other factors that you guys listed. How replicable are they and how much do you think you're going to see competitors trying to become, as an example, more nimble in the way that they're underwriting land to try to compete better with the likes of Lennar in the land market now? In other words, how high are the barriers to entry right now? How long will it take your competitors to try to do some of these things more efficiently?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, let's just be clear that it is a very competitive land environment. And as you highlight Rialto as a distinguishing factor, keep in mind that Rialto has taught a lot of our homebuilding divisions out here how to do these things in local markets. So it's really Rialto almost on steroids right now in the markets across the country. The things you need to think about is the DNA in Lennar has always been land oriented. And we look at things in a different way than many of the other builders. We're not averse to developing our own land or working with landowners to work on entitlements. And as a result, we don't have a need to just go in there and buy finished homesites because that's what our metrics are with regard to how we operate. So from a process standpoint, we are very nimble. We're fast. We don't have an enormous book-building process to get things reviewed at a local then a regional then a corporate level that takes 3 or 4 weeks or sometimes months. We can make those decisions relatively quickly. And with all of that in mind, I think that speed is a huge differentiator, as well as the ability to do things that are extraordinarily complex.
Stuart A. Miller: Let me add to that. There are 2 components of land acquisition. Number one is finding the things to negotiate on, and number two is the way that you go about negotiating. I think it's very hard to just hire someone and to replicate. I think that what you've seen in our management team, whether it's Jon and Rick on the Homebuilding side, whether it's Jeff and Jay Mantz on the Rialto side, or Eric Feder as the bridge, so much of what we're able to identify is being driven by relationships, relationships that have been put in place over these past couple of years through the toughest of times. And there's a certain thickness to those relationships that is sticky and is really positioning us well. But a lot of what Rick highlighted as well is beyond just access to the deals. It's the way that our group has reacted to those deals that augments the relationship and basically feeds back to it. It's the speed at which we operate. It's the completeness with which we deal with people. It's the integrity that we bring to the table and the decision to do the homework in advance and not end up retrading and walking away from a whole bunch of deals that is really holding us in good stead as people look for certainty of close. So my personal view is that it's not easily replicatable [ph], and we're in an awfully good position right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question on Rialto. I know it's been -- obviously, it's a segment that will not necessarily go in a straight line, but you did mention you're not necessarily where you want to be in terms of the earnings out of there. And I was just wondering if you can kind of walk through maybe where you're -- kind of reiterate -- maybe get a little bit more granular in terms of the different buckets that you break out, where you're maybe having the most challenges, what you might be doing if there's anything to do differently over the next couple of quarters to maybe get that back on track ultimately to where you think it should be at this point.
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. I think the way that I look at it, Mike, is, first of all, as we kind of segregate out or think through the component parts of Rialto, PPIP is performing very well. Our private equity or private investment fund is performing extremely well. The area where we probably had the most kind of letdown is in some of our earlier portfolios where I think Jeff highlighted well the fact that because -- really what you're seeing is moral hazard at work. What we're seeing -- and we have a long history of dealing with borrowers and distressed debt. What we've been seeing is that the borrowers have taken a more adamant, obstinate position in dealing with the workout team and have almost just blocked the doors without any legal basis in coming or not coming to the resolution table. In many instances, they've been hiding behind pending legislation from either friends or legislative friends who they've engaged to try to get legislation to bail them out of what might be a bad contractual relationship or a bad personal guarantee. And so the resolution process has been somewhat frustrated and stymied by a longer resolution period and some additional legal cost in getting to where we had expected to be in our initial diligence. So timing is proving to be somewhat elusive. At the end of the day, what we're finding is that the legislative attempts and the attempts of borrowers to subvert their notes and personal obligations is ultimately falling by the wayside. And over time, we think that we're going to end up in the place that we thought we would end up, but those initial deals are not performing timing-wise the way that we had hoped that they would.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Just to take Rialto from the other side, because I believe you did mention that it is contributing to the core homebuilding operations in a competitive -- almost as a competitive -- as a competitive advantage, very much beneficial to the gross margin levels. So on the flipside, I was hoping perhaps over the -- this past quarter, the last couple of quarters, if you could give any insight in terms of, I think you've done this before, what proportion of the land deals that you've entered into recently are through those more, through the Rialto relationships where you have a less competitive or noncompetitive bidding process. And when you look at the gross margin expansion that you've had, it would appear that most of it is just from less -- lower incentive levels, but any insight around the contribution to the gross margins would also be helpful in understanding the other elements of Rialto.
Stuart A. Miller: Well, look, I think that as I've noted, we've had some mild disappointments on timing relative to some of our earlier deals. But Rialto has been a grand slam home run for this company in terms of what it has done, in terms of positioning us to be able to grow and enhance our primary Homebuilding business, not just from the standpoint of access to deals because frankly, that's gone both ways. The relationships on the Lennar side have sometimes found new business for Rialto and sometimes very much in the opposite direction. But the knowledge base that our Rialto team has enhanced our homebuilding operations with in terms of the breadth of kinds of deals that we can undertake to purchase in order to get to land, whether it's CDD bonds, as Rick points out, or purchasing notes on assets or just having relationships with borrowers or people in the real estate business, we have leveraged the Rialto franchise as a very, very strong driver of Lennar business. Now this disentangling and getting to percentages of deals that derive from the Rialto side, the Lennar side and what percentage has the Rialto relationship actually played, we just can't break it out that way because it's kind of too organic. It's intertwined. And I've highlighted the work of Eric, Eric Feder, as the bridge between the 2 operating divisions. I mean, we have a very smooth and compatible relationship between both sides that's kind of amplifying the performance on both sides. As it relates to the performance of Rialto going forward, we have absolutely put together a blue-chip team of loan workout professionals that will be a platform for our business going forward, but we will recalibrate and get those operations working more in line with the way we expected in the beginning.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Can I squeeze one more in? It looked like community count, given your sales pace community count was down roughly 5% year-over-year, can you give us a guidance of where you might end up for the year end or what you think about 2013?
Stuart A. Miller: Community count?
Richard Beckwitt: I think as we said in prior calls, from the beginning of the year we thought we'd be up about 5% to 10% from the community count we started in the year.
Stuart A. Miller: On a net basis.
Operator: Our next question is from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: I was hoping to ask about your gross margin guidance. I believe the high end of your range, 22.5%, is equal to what you guys reported this quarter. And obviously, this quarter's results were much stronger than your prior guidance range. And it seems -- based on your commentary, I know you're having some success raising prices or reducing incentives. And from Jon's comments, you've been pretty successful in mitigating the cost inflation you're seeing on the materials side. So just curious why you wouldn't make, maybe, a range a little bit higher than where you're currently at today and whether there's any other issues I'm missing here, either mix or something along those lines, that would offset some of those price increases.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. As I said in my comments, we do feel that we've got cost control measures in place that will help offset what's happening in the field with pressure on labor and materials. We are very focused on incentives and sales prices. But as you look forward, those factors are going to -- those pressures in the field starts -- increase will continue to ramp up. And very hard to predict what the mix is, how that will affect what that gross margin is. And as we look to the different mix of deliveries from the markets changing in the 4 quarters, we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we gave.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Okay. Appreciate that. And then on the corporate line, it looks think there's a little bit of a sequential increase there to about $29 million, and that's a bit higher than you had been running at. Just curious if that's a function of the new markets you're entering or whether there were some one-timers in there and where can we think about a run rate going forward?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. Alan, this is Bruce. As you look at last year, the number was below normal. I think we're averaging close to $24 million a quarter last year. This year is $29 million. It's primarily due to stock-based compensation expense, as the stock has gone up. And some of the variable compensation expense also added to the G&A this quarter.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: So that's something you expect to be recurring going forward or dependent somewhat on the performance?
Bruce E. Gross: We haven't given exact guidance, but I would expect as our profits go up, variable compensation expense will as well. And as the stock prices increase, the stock compensation expense will also. So I would expect that it's likely to be higher than what you've seen in the past year for those reasons.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen East of ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Stuart, if we could go back to demand just for a minute. As we walk [ph] communities [indiscernible], will we see where it looks like a lot of the new home sales are being helped quite a bit by lack of competing inventory. And I'm just wondering, from your standpoint, whether you think that's true or not. And then also, if that is true, are you starting to see it slide into, call it, the B-, C+ locations or any particular segment demand out there?
Stuart A. Miller: Let me give that over to Rick and Jon. They're a little bit closer to it.
Richard Beckwitt: As far as the B, B-, I think with the improving market, all communities are starting to perform a little bit better. But clearly, the better-located A locations are capturing the lion's share of the activity. We're seeing increased demand out there. A lot of it has to do with the lack of availability of competing product, and that's given us the ability to raise prices and decrease incentives. And as Jon said earlier, our sales pace per community pretty much across the company has improved regionally and by each market.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Steve, this is Jon. I think as you're aware, Phoenix is a good example of the answer to your question where MLS listings dropped pretty dramatically. That, in turn, helped the pace of sales and pricing for the new home product. But as you get to the B- and C locations around Phoenix, those are not doing as well. So if you're down on Buckeye or Goodyear, they're not doing as well as Chandler and Scottsdale and the closer-in markets. I think we can pretty much see that kind of scenario playing out across the country and in the various markets.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then if we look at -- you gave breakout of land spend, et cetera, and talked about community growth. Are you demothballing the communities to any degree? And you've got a new revolver in place, so at what level are you comfortable with your cash balance? So in other words, how do you look at land spend, et cetera, moving forward?
Stuart A. Miller: It's interesting that in our division presidents' meeting we went through each of our divisions. Each division president gives the presentation, and we're very carefully monitoring the progress of mothballed communities. And the answer is, yes, there are some that are starting to come online. And we actually have some pretty good examples of some that are really starting to contribute to our gross margin and bottom line.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then one last quick question, are you seeing any shortages of labor in any of your markets or anything along those lines that are pushing out your delivery date?
Stuart A. Miller: Just a little bit, and it involves the trades either [ph]. But certainly, as is typical in market recoveries, sales go first, then starts, and then labor has to catch up to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: This is Desi filling in for Bob. So regarding gross margins, you guys discussed sales incentives as a percentage of revenues were lower for the quarter. The lowering of incentives -- is that something you're seeing competitors do as well in the markets that you operate?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, the competition, they're doing all sorts of things. I think everybody in the industry is trying to raise prices and trying to reduce incentives. And the success of our peers out there, I think you'll have to ask them with regard to what they're doing and how effective they are.
Desi DiPierro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then for Financial Services, obviously, there was a big jump there in operating income. And then in terms of the operating leverage in that segment, with the increase in spend, new orders and deliveries, is that something you would expect going forward how the operating income could increase that greatly.
Bruce E. Gross: Well, the operating leverage is there in Financial Services, just like we're seeing with Homebuilding. I think the one thing to note is that there was a significant increase in volume, a lot of that attributable to refinance activity. So the refinance activity will be certainly lumpy depending on what happens with interest rates.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: In looking at your operating margins, I wanted to find out how your incremental margin performance compared with the 16% guidance you gave last quarter. We estimated roughly 30% because you had gross margin expansion, as well as the SG&A leverage. Is that accurate? And what do you think is achievable going forward in terms of incremental margins?
Bruce E. Gross: So again, just to go back to last quarter, what we said is in an existing community, when we go from 2 sales a month to 3 sales a month per community, the incremental operating margin is about 16%. And that was assuming the 21% gross margin and then the incremental SG&A expense of about 4.5% or so. So that type of incremental leverage was a little bit higher this quarter as the gross margin was a little higher than the 21%. So we still believe the incremental operating leverage in existing communities to be at about that level or possibly a little bit higher. In new communities, it's a little bit less because the SG&A expense is a little higher. You have to hire sales and construction people, bring on new models. And there, we typically say that the SG&A incrementally is 7% or 8%, so your incremental operating margin will be a little bit less. So we do expect that incremental operating leverage to continue.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So margins, as your volume increases, margins should still expand. Secondly, just on the backlog conversion guidance, the lower spec -- is the lower spec mix a function of the market or a change in your strategy? And then secondly, are you intentionally constraining delivery pace in order to both manage your margins, as well as control construction and labor costs?
Stuart A. Miller: No. First of all, I don't think that we're managing our deliveries. And I think that we've highlighted that we're very focused on generating strong margins, and so we've had a very measured approach to both sales and starts. I highlighted in my remarks that looking, watching our gross margins, you're seeing that we have a very carefully programmed approach to pricing our product, making sure that we're maintaining margins. So this has been something that's been consistent over the past years. In terms of what is affecting our backlog delivery ratio is the fact then we are -- we've seen a fairly aggressive strong move in sales. We are probably selling a higher percentage right now of unstarted homes, of homes that will take -- that will have more cycle time remaining in them. So as we face the third quarter deliveries, we recognize that we're simply not going to be able to deliver as high a percentage of the backlog, and this is just what we're seeing as we sit here today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jack Micenko of Susquehanna International Group.
John R. Benda - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: This is John Benda on for Jack. I just had a couple of quick questions for you. First is that with our regional bank coverage we're seeing increased mortgage repurchase reserving, I just wonder if you guys saw any of those trends in your Financial Services unit in the quarter?
Stuart A. Miller: No, we did not see any significant trend there, no.
John R. Benda - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So there are no new [indiscernible]. And then as a follow-up with the DTA reversal, I know you listed about 8 factors. Was Lennar's cumulative loss position a big consideration in the valuation allowance reversal? Or was that not looked at or just not given much weight?
Bruce E. Gross: The cumulative loss is something that is evaluated, but we're still in a cumulative loss position. So there has to be a significant positive [indiscernible] that comes into place, and it has to be significant while you're still in that cumulative loss position. So that was taken into account, but there was enough positive evidence that allowed us to reverse the DTA.
John R. Benda - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Great. And was there a PPIP mark in the quarter?
Bruce E. Gross: It was negligible. It was a couple [indiscernible] thousand dollars.
Stuart A. Miller: All right. Very good. We'll wrap it up here. I know that we took a little bit long with our opening remarks, but we wanted to cover a lot of ground. We certainly appreciate everybody joining us for our second quarter update and look forward to reporting our quarter -- on the third quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, good. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter 2012 Update. I'm joined here as always by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; Dave Collins, our Controller. We also have Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, CEO of Rialto. I'm going to give some overview remarks both on the economy and the housing market and on Lennar in particular, and then I'm going to turn it over to the management team to give additional background in detail. After we open the phone lines, as always, we'd like to ask that you limit your question to just one question, one follow-up please, so that we can be as fair as possible to all. So as I sit here today, I'm really pleased with our solid first quarter 2012 operating results, and what they represent relative to the housing market in general and to Lennar in particular. Our first quarter results reflect another quarter of confirmation that both the housing market and the overall economy are stabilizing, and that a very real trend is beginning to take shape. They also demonstrate that our operating team is executing extremely well in a complicated environment. I previewed in our third and fourth quarter conference calls that we were beginning to see evidence of a genuine turn in the residential housing market, and this could be a harbinger of market stability. Last quarter, I was feeling somewhat more confident that the market was, in fact, changing, and this quarter marks further evidence that stabilization is really taking hold. The consistent message is that the general environment is different now than it's been in the past many years. There are discernible fundamental shifts appearing in the home market, and there are empirical data points that are, to-date, confirming that the market is showing real signs of stability. With that said, and as we saw from last week's reported national sales starts and permits numbers, yesterday's pending home sales numbers and today's Case-Shiller Index, that the housing market is not yet in full recovery. In fact, the stabilization process after a full 7-year decline in housing is rocky and erratic and is certainly not yet broad based. Let me tell you a little bit about how we are thinking about the things that we're seeing in the field versus the national numbers that are being reported. Four important themes are driving housing stabilization; 3 are demand-related and 1 is supply-related. First, today's consumer is looking at the home purchase differently than in the past years. The home purchase is no longer a place to invest savings in order to ride a wave of price increases. Instead, today's buyers are looking for real value. They are finding real value in for-sale housing. We know that home prices and volumes are low and interest rates are at historical lows and affordability is extremely high today. Today's consumers are beginning to realize that housing presents an undeniable value proposition, and we're hearing this from them in the field. Accordingly, we're experiencing more traffic in our welcome home centers and customers are actively discussing their desire to find a way to purchase and capitalize on this moment in time. They're starting to feel pressure not to miss this moment, and that's being reinforced by discussion with family and friends, buying and owning a home is no longer taboo at the dining room table. And in the field, we're witnessing instances where customers returning for a second visit are finding that the home that they wanted is sold. Second trend, today's housing consumers also seeking to avoid the rental market. The fully loaded cost of ownership is lower in most desirable markets than comparable rental rates. We've carefully studied this trend and have found that while this might not show up in national statistics, in local competitive markets, principal, interest, taxes, insurance, community association, lawn care are all together lower than the competitive rental market. Today, for-sale housing represents an excellent value proposition on a pure monthly payment basis versus renting. Additionally, consumers are looking for an alternative to the annual repricing inherent in the rental market. Rental prices are high, and they've been moving up. Today's consumer is looking for living cost stability, as well as a safe and stable place to raise a family. They're looking to reconsider the rental lifestyle, where rental rates have been rising and are likely to continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Third trend, improvement in employment and consumer confidence has translated into the end of negative household formation. The trend of children moving home and elderly parents moving in with children is at least slowing and may be reversing. Over time, this trend will be an even more powerful driver of demand increases. Now some have suggested that the gains in the first part of the year might be weather-related, since it's been abnormally warm in the North. We, however, see strength across our platform, including warmer markets where weather is not a factor, and where warmth in the North might even be a negative to sales in the South. It seems that the improvements derive from fundamental shifts. On the supply side, concerns remain about the overhang of REO and foreclosure inventory. As I noted earlier, market improvement is uneven across cities, states and the country. In the field, we are seeing pockets of activity develop across the country, not region- or state-specific. These pockets are developing in many areas that are starting to recover. These are geographic pockets that are defined by their desirable location, driving the absorption of REO, foreclosure and defaulted loan inventory. Supply is running short in these areas and demand is pushing prices higher in some instances or is pushing the boundaries of desirability outward in other instances. The broader market, outside these pockets of activity, remain weak. While at present, these pockets are isolated, they are growing in both size and number. It's likely that national numbers are not reflecting these themes because they incorporate and average in their data the secondary and tertiary markets that are not yet in recovery and do not affect our competitive landscape. But the more desirable housing markets are experiencing a fundamental change as foreclosure inventories have been absorbed, fewer distressed investor sales are being made and consumers recognize the value proposition. Overall, we've seen that demand is growing, and in carefully selected markets, supply is limited. Nevertheless, demand still remains constrained or is being held back by the mortgage qualification standards and processes that have been overcorrected by the severity of the downturn, but demand is growing and customers are looking to find ways to qualify for loan and waiting for some loosening of credit standards. Turning now to Lennar specifically. In our first quarter, we saw a fundamental improvement in all of the building blocks that define our homebuilding and Financial Services operations, while Rialto continued to build and augment its blue-chip operating platform. Our management team is executing on all fronts. On the homebuilding front, sales continued a significant pattern of improvement, growing 33% over first quarter 2011, and that compares trend-wise to a 20% year-over-year improvement in the fourth quarter of last year. Our improved sales year-over-year and sequentially come from a fairly flat community count, which means that our sales per community are improving. Perhaps most notably, these sales improvements are not the result of unusual sales promotions or discounts as reflected by our improved gross and net margins. Post-impairment gross margins improved from 20% to 20.9%, while post-impairment net margin improved 3.6% to 6%. We are maintaining and even growing margins while expanding sales. These margin gains are reflective of a fundamentally sound sales program that is not compromising margin to gain sales, but instead is maintaining price stability, reducing incentives and beginning to show overhead leverage as volume improves. Additionally, we're not pushing to grow the quantity of active communities, but are more focused on the quality of our active communities. Accordingly, we have invested cash aggressively to position our company with high-quality communities in A locations that enable us to produce solid margins and leverage overhead. This affords us the position to be able to manage our business with carefully designed value-oriented product and efficient production and marketing program under our Everything's Included branding and a rightsized overhead structure. As we look ahead to future quarters, our strategy of focusing on high margins in well-positioned communities will prove to be the engine that drives SG&A operating leverage that will produce strong bottom line earnings. Rick and Jon will describe our homebuilding operations strategy in greater detail in just a minute. Our Financial Services segment also performed very well in our first quarter. It generated operating earnings of $8.3 million versus $1.2 million last year. Earnings here derive from a consistent mortgage and title program that reports through our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce Gross, who will further describe how this important segment is not only profitable, but is providing consistency and dependability in a difficult mortgage environment. Finally, our Rialto segment has also produced profits in the first quarter as it continued to grow its underlying business. While Rialto earnings have declined year-over-year, from $11 million last year to $9.4 million this year, we have noted that Rialto profits have the general tendency to be less predictable on a quarter-by-quarter basis as we carefully manage the sale and resolution of assets to maximize value. We remain very enthusiastic about the earnings power in the assets we've already purchased, and we're certain that future quarters will demonstrate the investment and earnings power of the overall Rialto machine. As I noted last quarter, Rialto completed its money raise for its first fund and ended with a $700-million pool of capital to invest in core assets to drive its future. To date, about 70% of that fund is invested and the pipeline for new investments is very strong. This fund will likely be fully invested by year end, and we will soon begin working on the capital raise for fund #2. As we look ahead, Rialto will continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will begin to return cash to corporate as it is now investing self-generated funds. Jeff Krasnoff will give additional detail on Rialto's operations in just a few minutes as well. All in all, our first quarter has been an excellent start for 2012 for Lennar as we've navigated the turbulent waters of the housing market in the U.S. economy seeking a bottom and stability. Our strategy has been to refine and position our company for recovery and remain profitable while we stay patient. This strategy has worked well for us. All of the segments of our company are now extremely well positioned, as you will now hear from our operating team. As I look ahead to the future quarters, I remain cautiously optimistic that we are seeing a real bottom form, and that we will begin to see a real recovery. National statistics and news will give us mixed signals as we move through the year as they represent a compendium of all of the best and the worst markets around the country. But I feel that stabilization and recovery will emanate from the most desirable markets and spread slowly outward over the next years. Lennar is positioned with a strong balance sheet in the right markets, with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions continue to improve. Now I'd like to turn over to Rick.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. We are really pleased with our operating results this quarter. These results were driven by both a well-executed land acquisition strategy and a fine-tuned homebuilding machine. I'm going to review our land activities and highlight what differentiates Lennar from our competition. Jon is then going to discuss our building activities and how we maximize the value of our land assets. There's no question in my mind that profitability in this business starts with land. You need to be in the right location at the right cost, at the right time, and with the right product to generate above market returns and sales. This takes great relationships with banks and land sellers, and it requires meticulous underwriting and market research. It also requires a team of land acquisition professionals that know how to scour the markets for unique opportunities. During the first quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring and optioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. Our primary focus was pursuing distressed opportunities with banks and other extremely motivated sellers through off-market deals in a noncompetitive process. Our new acquisitions were located in markets where we saw the greatest strength and value proposition. As in the past, our focus has been on highly desirable communities located in micro-markets where people really want to live and where foreclosed homes have already been absorbed by the market. We invested in A-plus areas and stayed away from the fringe or tertiary markets, where price was the only driver. This micro-market investment focus has significantly enhanced our gross margins and our new sales orders. This quarter, we purchased 4,225 homesites for $200 million -- $212 million, and we spent $61 million on land development. Combined, our land acquisition and land development spend was up about 34% over the prior-year period. In the first quarter, we also gained title to an additional 3,400 homesites through negotiated settlements. In addition, we signed option contracts to acquire approximately 1,340 homesites. As you can see, this was a very busy and highly productive quarter for Lennar on the land acquisition side. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 39% of our land purchases in the first quarter were located in Florida, 22% in Texas, 14% in the Pacific Northwest, 11% in the mid-Atlantic, 10% in the West, with the remaining 4% spread throughout our other markets. As in prior quarters, the lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of a competitive bid environment. We stayed away from the typical broker to bid type of deals and directly sourced a large percentage of our land transaction. This is a clear differentiating factor for Lennar. Another key difference is our willingness to engage in highly complicated transactions that requires significant planning and take months, if not years, to reach the end result. These deals are not for the faint of heart and require an intricate knowledge of vested entitlements and creditor rights. But when carefully executed, these opportunities can be incredibly profitable and generate outsized returns. To give you a sense of what I'm talking about, I would like to highlight 2 transactions that came together last quarter. Negotiations on these 2 transaction began almost 2 years ago, and we subsequently purchased the debt at deep discounts in fiscal 2011 and took title to the land in the first quarter of 2012. We are now the proud owner of a crown jewel position in Doral, Florida, one of the hottest submarkets in the United States. Representing more than half a square mile, this property has approximately 2,400 homesites and will be an extremely profitable multiyear position for the company. This deal involved the purchase of more than $218 million of debt instruments, including CDD bonds, community development district bonds, loans held by multiple banks, delinquent taxes and was subject to a litigation between the prior land developer and owner and various creditors. In addition, the CDD and the bank debt had competing first lien positions on the collateral, creating the perfect storm. For us, this represented an incredible opportunity in our backyard, a 3-dimensional chess game with no other viable buyer. So we mapped out a detailed plan to resolve the dispute and gain control of the first lien positions. What we needed to do was bring everyone to the table to create a workable solution. Fortunately, we had a great relationship with the banks, the bondholders and the original land developer, so we were able to work with each group individually to create a win-win for everyone involved. After months of intense negotiation, we acquired the CDD bonds and the first lien bank debt in 2011 and then settled with the original developer and a second position bank in 2012. This new Doral community, which is a stone's throw from our corporate office, will drive margins for years to come because of its extremely attractive land bases. We should deliver our first homes in this community by year end. The second transaction involved a property in Naples, Florida. In the first quarter of this year, we took ownership of a high-end, substantially developed master-planned community with a fully operation TPC golf course. This community has the only TPC-branded golf course in Southwest Florida. The property, just located 5 miles from downtown Naples, included more than 1,000 acres and 1,050 homesites, 32% of which were fully developed. Similar to the Doral opportunity I described earlier, this deal involved approximately $158 million in debt instruments, including CDD bonds, traditional bank debt held by multiple banks and delinquent taxes. We began our diligence on this opportunity in early 2010 and created a strategy to harness the enormous potential value of this asset. During our diligence, we uncovered that the encumbered collateral also included a 10-acre commercial property fronting a major Naples thoroughfare and a 1.5-acre marina in downtown Naples, which in addition to the golf course community, made this investment a no-brainer if we could put the pieces together. We started negotiations with the various lenders and bondholders in 2010, acquired the bank debt and tax certificates in entirely 2011 and restructured and purchased the CDD in the first quarter of 2012. Through a lot of hard work and tenacity, we acquired at a significant discount one of the finest golf course communities in Florida, and we'll have a multiyear highly profitable building program going forward. I hope these 2 deals give you a sense of some of the unique investments we've been making. While the land market has heated up recently, we continue to see great opportunities out there. We are still underwriting our new deals to exceed a 20% gross margin and a 20% IRR with no inflation. To date, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of our new land acquisitions. During the first quarter, approximately 45% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put under control in the last 3 years. Our gross margin on the closings in these deals continue to be 200 basis points higher than the overall company average. Before I turn it over to Jon, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory increased about $428 million to approximately $4.3 billion and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Our inventory during the first quarter increased about $317 million from the end of 2011. At February 29, 2012, we owned and controlled 117,086 homesites and had 426 active communities. While our community count is down on a year-over-year basis, it increased slightly during the first quarter. As Stuart said, we are focused more on community quality and not quantity. This should be very clear from our operating results. Nonetheless, you should see our community count increase by about 5% to 10% by year end based on our land acquisition activity. Finally, I'd like to think our land acquisition staff across the country and in particular, our team in Florida. I have no doubt that we have the best team in the business. Like to turn it over to Jon now.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Thank you, Rick, and good morning. As Stuart noted, we're very pleased with our first quarter results of a post-impairment 20.9% gross margin and 6% operating margin, respectively 90- and 240-basis-point improvements. This achievement was the result of continued intense focus by our management team on each of the component parts of our business. I will speak to how once the land is in place, we derive profitability by our management of product, pricing, direct cost and leveraging our operating structure. To ensure that the homes we build are a great value to the homebuyer, each land acquisition is underwritten with the strategy of executing our Everything's Included platform. This means that what we have – that we have done the research to know exactly what we'll be offering in home designs, square footages and included features that together present a great value to the homebuyer. Lennar's Everything's Included approach not only continues to compete effectively against resales, but also presents a great value to renters who are looking at the opportunity to buy a home. This process, combined with an improving sales environment, enabled us to achieve a 33% year-over-year improvement in new orders without the aid of increased community count and while maintaining healthy gross margins. Much of our sales strength in the first quarter continued to be driven by the strong performance of our well-located new communities, where we achieved a higher sales pace compared to our legacy communities. However, we did begin to see improvement in these legacy communities midway and through the quarter in most of our markets. New orders from our new communities increased to 48% of our Q1 orders, up from 35% last year. This quarter we experienced increase in higher quality traffic levels in our communities, up from what we saw in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, we saw a sequential improvement in new orders month-over-month, and so far in March, we are seeing continued strength similar to the absorption rates we saw at the end of the first quarter. We are actively working with potential homebuyers on credit repair and reaching out to existing renters to educate them on the benefits of homeownership. A good example of this is an event we recently held in Las Vegas. To market our credit repair program and home purchase opportunities to renters, we had a gourmet food truck challenge. I don't know if the gourmet food truck craze has hit where you live yet, but it is very strong in Vegas. Our division held the event at a shopping center parking lot that is central to multiple rental communities. In other words, we went to where the potential customers live rather than spending advertising dollars trying to bring them to us. Between our own social media efforts, along with flyers, postcards and door hangers, the social media efforts of the food truck companies and drive-by traffic, we had a tremendous turnout. This led to hundreds of people registering with us, many starting a credit repair process and visiting our communities. Our mortgage company, Universal American Mortgage Company, was at the event working to help educate these potential buyers. This was a great success, an example of how we benefit from our strong and consistent relationship with UAMC. As the market continues to recover, and we begin to see sales prices improve, we are also seeing adjustment on the cost side of our business. We are optimistic that these cost pressures will be offset by sales price improvements, as well as by some cost savings that are structural and long term. It is for these reasons that we expect gross margins to remain level, but we expect net operating margins to improve from our operating leverage. We see this in the year-over-year first quarter comparisons of gross margin improvement from 20% to 20.9%, while net margins improved from 3.6% to 6%. As in the prior 5 quarters, our current average direct cost of homes remains in the range of $40 to $42 per square foot. We have a very thorough process of breaking down detailed cost in each of the items that make up a cost category onto an item master. This allows us to negotiate price protection on specific items and to value engineer lasting improvements. An example of this is with engineered wood products. This would primarily be I-Joist and beams. We've engineered more efficient home designs, where the needs and values for engineered wood products are less. This has allowed us to save $500 per home at the same time that the cost of engineered lumber has increased. We are also focused intently on managing extras. Extras are items charged to the builder beyond the contract amount. With the benefit of greater detail provided by the unbundling process and Item Master, we are able to create more accountability in managing extras. This allows us to quickly adjust contracts scopes of work, to eliminate these costs from the system. As I said, as sales prices increase -- sales prices improve, there will be various fluctuations in some materials, commodities and labor. But our purchasing systems and processes, combined with improving sales pricing, will have us well positioned to maintain our gross margins. This quarter, we saw the ability to leverage our operating structure as the year-over-year 30% improvement in deliveries helped us achieve an SG&A percentage of 14.9%, a year-over-year 150-basis-point improvement. We continue to maintain our intense management of SG&A cost. Similar to direct cost, I believe that we have made structural changes that allow us to affect long-lasting savings as our volume increases. We have in place a very strong management team that is organized in a simplified regional and divisional structure that will allow for growth with few additions to the structure. I do want to note that in the first quarter we expensed overhead associated with our new Seattle and Portland operations, but as I previously stated, we will see deliveries from those operations in the back half of the year. Across our divisions we are actively and intensely managing each of the components that make up our net operating margin. I want to thank our associates for their focus and execution of each of these components of our business and achieving our ninth straight quarter of positive post-impairment operating margin. Thank you. And I would now like to turn it over to Jeff.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Before Bruce reviews the details behind Rialto's $9.4 million of operating earnings for the quarter, along with the results for the rest of the company, there were a few areas that might be helpful to touch on to give a little bit more perspective on what's going on at Rialto. As an integral part of the Lennar story, our focused Rialto team that now includes over 200 strong, continues to push forward the resolution and value add of distressed and advantageously priced real estate assets. Being able to integrate the unique talents and well-coordinated resources of the entire Lennar team has been and continues to be a unique advantage that has positioned Rialto extremely well. Rialto currently has 3 areas from which it derives its revenue and earnings: PPIP, our balance sheet portfolio investments and our fund business. If you recall, Rialto's first investment opportunity was our PPIP fund with AllianceBernstein and the U.S. Treasury. From inception, this $4.6 billion funds mortgage-backed securities portfolio has produced a steady stream of interest income and fees on our $68 million investment that it's been at or above our expectations. And during this past quarter, as the capital markets gained new optimism about the fundamentals behind the home mortgage securities that back the lion's share of our investment portfolio, we saw the mark-to-market on our investment regain about $8.4 million of value that had been marked down in prior quarters. During the quarter, we continued to create value from our second income generator, our balance sheet distressed real estate portfolios. These include our 2 FDIC transactions and our initial bank portfolio investments. In addition to collecting $560 million in cash to date on these portfolios, we have now repositioned over $1.6 billion of loans into owned real estate, which includes developer homes, land and all varieties of commercial properties across the country. Our activities in these investments include adding property improvements, paying legal fees, in some cases, the payment of several years of past-due property taxes, the majority of which are nonrecurring. Because most of these costs are expensed as incurred and revenue is recognized as properties are sold or collections are made from guarantors, in the short run, earnings from this portion of the business will have the tendency to be less predictable. In this area, while our revenues and earnings were less than prior quarters, we remain comfortable we will produce the results we sought when we initially invested in these assets as we carefully manage their dispositions to maximize value. In our third area, our fund business, as we mentioned last quarter, and Stuart mentioned earlier, our current exclusive investment vehicle is the Rialto real estate fund, which now has $700 million of equity commitments from over 2 dozen different investor groups, including $75 million from us. The fund has been able to acquire or tie up over 30 different transactions, and our pipeline of new investments continues to be strong. We've already invested approximately $520 million of fund equity to acquire about $1.5 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance for about $0.38 on the dollar. About 3/4 of our fund investments so far have been distressed portfolios from regional and community banks, CMBS special servicers and nonbank financial institutions. The bulk of the remaining investments are in new issue CMBS securities with strong current cash flows, where we found attractive pricing unlike any we have seen since the 1990s. And through the end of the quarter, the fund has already collected $65 million from interest, principal and asset resolutions at levels significantly higher and sooner than originally anticipated. Even with the most recent improvements in the capital markets, lenders still remain under both internal and external pressure to dispose of distressed real estate assets as they try to get back into the lending business. In addition, with over $1 trillion of commercial real estate debt coming due in the next 3 years, we expect to continue to see an abundance of opportunities that fit perfectly with our skill set and deep relationships that we have developed with a number of key sellers. As a result, we're currently focusing on bringing out our next investment vehicle. We believe that these and future funds will not only help to enhance the company's returns and add consistent cash flow and earnings, but will also be important building blocks for us to develop a first-class investment management business. These are just a few of the reasons we remain excited about the continued progress of our Rialto franchise, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Bruce. Thank you.
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. Before I provide more details on our numbers, I'd like to comment on our Financial Services segment, which is always reported to our corporate office and has been run distinctly separate from our sales and homebuilding operations. Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $8.3 million versus $1.2 million last year, and this is the strongest first quarter operating earnings for our Financial Services in 5 years. Our mortgage pretax income increased to $8.9 million from $3.4 million in the prior year. And this quarter's mortgage originations increased by 33% to $743 million. With the significant operating leverage in our mortgage operations, this resulted in a 160% increase in pretax earnings. Our in-house mortgage company had a capture rate of Lennar homebuyers of 78% in the first quarter. The mortgage company's home loan advisors communicate with prospective Lennar homebuyers very early in the buying process and by understanding the homebuyer's ability to qualify for a mortgage, this has helped Lennar's cancellation rate remain at very low levels. This quarter's cancellation rate was 18%. Having an effective mortgage company working with the homebuilder has led to consistency and dependability for homebuilding deliveries as noted by our consistent backlog conversion ratio that's been over 100% consistently. The first quarter is historically the lowest volume quarter for the title company. Our title company had a $100,000 loss in the first quarter, but that improved compared to the $1.7 million loss in the prior year, and this was a result of additional cost saving initiatives that were successfully implemented. Approximately 10% of our title company transactions were with Lennar homebuyers, and the remainder were with third parties. The hard-working associates in our Financial Services segment have consolidated operations, refined processes and are well positioned to see continued operating leverage as the housing market recovers. Turning back to our overall results, starting with homebuilding, revenues from home sales increased 33% at $611 million, driven by a 30% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 3% increase in average sales price to $246,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: the East region was $222,000, and that was up 3%; Southeast Florida region was $265,000, that was up 1%; Central was $220,000, that was up 4%; Houston was $230,000, up 3%; West was $317,000, up 5%; and other was $361,000, down 6%. The gross margin on home sales that was reported at 20.9% in the first quarter was up 90 basis points to the prior year. And as you remember in our last conference call, we did provide a gross margin percentage range for 2012 of 19.5% to 21.5% before impairments. We came in at the higher end of the range due to delivering a more favorable product mix of higher gross margin percent homes, which includes an increasing percentage of deliveries from new communities, which Rick touched on. The gross margins were strongest in the East and Southeast Florida regions this quarter, and sales incentives as a percentage of home sale revenue was consistent with our fourth quarter at 12.2% and up just slightly from last year's first quarter at 12.1% as a percentage of home sale revenue. As a result of the strong gross margins and improvements in SG&A that Jon talked about, our homebuilding operating margins improved 240 basis points from the prior year to 6%. This was the highest first quarter operating margin in 6 years. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries was $1.1 million versus $8.7 million in the prior year. The large gain in the prior year was due to the company booking its share of a gain on debt extinguishment at one of the company's joint ventures, partially offset by valuation adjustments. Other income was $4.1 million versus $30 million in the prior year, and the large gain in the prior year was due to $29.5 million of the $37.5 million litigation settlement, which was included in the other income line. Impairments declined significantly in this year's first quarter to only $2 million versus $22 million in the prior year's quarter. Turning to our Rialto business segment, they generated operating earnings of $9.4 million, and this number is after adding back $4.3 million of net losses attributable to noncontrolling interest versus $11 million in the prior year. The composition of Rialto's $9.4 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: The FDIC portfolios had a $1.5 million loss, non-FDIC portfolios had a $1.2 million loss, PPIP contributed $11 million of earnings and the Rialto real estate fund contributed $7.6 million of earnings. Then subtracting out $6.5 million of general and administration expenses and other, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of $5.9 million, you will get to the $9.4 million of operating earnings. The negative $2.7 million contribution from the FDIC and non-FDIC portfolios this quarter are primarily due to 2 items: First, as Jeff touched on, revenue was impacted by the timing of deficiency collections and REO activity. Second, as REO inventory increased, there is an acceleration of expenses relating to catching up on prior year's unpaid property taxes and legal expenses incurred to collect on deficiency judgments. These results will vary from quarter to quarter due to the uneven timing of deficiency collections and REO activity. Additionally, we're in the process of petitioning to reduce property taxes on the REO properties going forward. The $11 million of earnings this quarter from our investment in PPIP is reported as equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities, the equity in earnings included net gains in the PPIP fund of $8.4 million, which relates primarily to unrealized gains as a result of mark-to-market adjustments, plus $2.6 million of interest income. Our interest in the Rialto real estate fund is also reported as equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities and generated approximately $7.6 million of profits for the quarter in addition to the management fees highlighted above. Rialto continues to generate strong cash flow, and at quarter end, the FDIC debt was paid down by $157 million, reducing the outstanding FDIC debt to $470 million. Additionally, there was $185 million in the defeasance account and in Rialto's cash account combined to further retire debt. The add back in calculating diluted earnings per share for our convertible securities was $2.9 million for this quarter. And during the quarter, our balance sheet remained strong. We continued to have ample liquidity, and our leverage remained low as our homebuilding debt to total capital, net of the $800 million of cash, was 49.6%. During the quarter, we raised an additional $50 million relating to the closing of the over-allotment portion of the 3.25% convertible senior notes. Let me provide some more detail on our $4.3 billion of inventory. Finished homesites during the quarter amounted to $576 million, and our construction-in-progress account was $854 million, totaling a combined $1.4 billion in that category. Land and land under development was $2.9 billion. We carefully managed our inventory during the quarter, and we ended the quarter averaging 1.5 completed unsold homes per community. There were 1,523 homes under construction that were sold and 2,293 unsold. Active community count during the quarter ended at 426 versus 422 sequentially in our fourth quarter. We opened 54 communities during the quarter and closed out of 50. In conclusion, we ended the quarter with our strongest quarterly backlog growth in about 10 years, up 39%. As this backlog converts to deliveries, and we continue through 2012, we expect to see the significant operating leverage in our business translate into improving operating margins and profitability. And with that, let me turn it over for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: My question relates to your comment, Bruce, on significant operating leverage, and understanding if there's opportunity to elaborate on that. And then just secondly, as it relates to your cost structure, a lot of people feel that Lennar's better than their peer average gross margins is related to their low lot cost basis, and yet, really the focus is on your strategy to provide Everything's Included versus homebuilders with design studios, and I was wondering if you can quantify some of the cost savings that are attainable [ph] because of your strategy on providing Everything's Included and maybe differentiate the company in that respect from an operating perspective?
Bruce E. Gross: Let me take the first part, Ivy, and then I'll turn it over to the operators to talk about your second part of the question. When we talk about significant operating leverage, when we have additional absorption per community, the incremental operating margin goes up considerably. So as you look at our gross margin, if it was flat at 21%, and with our SG&A where it is today at 14.9%, one more sale per community has an incremental SG&A expense of about 4.5%. So the incremental operating margin is approximately 16% as our absorption increases per community. That's where the significant operating leverage is coming from, and that's why we believe our operating margins will continue to grow as volume picks up.
Stuart A. Miller: Yes, we really highlighted in our remarks that we focused on the quality of communities rather than quantity because that's where we pick up the greatest operating leverage. If we can increase the number of sales per community as a first round of improvement, we're going to start to see some real earnings strength out of that. As to your second question...
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: That was not limited to just the SG&A though, correct? It's gross margin is benefiting as well?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, we're not commenting as aggressively on that. We recognize that as prices go up, some of the cost will go up as well. We do think that there will be gross margin improvement as well. But I think that we're going to wait and see how the market evolves for that. But certainly, the net margin benefits more dramatically. As it relates to Everything's Included, we've long believed that our EI platform is an efficient operating platform. But even more so, at the beginning of recovery and as the market remains a more value-oriented market at other times in a market cycle, where there's pricing power and there's the ability to pass on the greater margins in options and extras, I think the 2 platforms compete more favorably. But at this point in the cycle, we think that the Everything's Included platform really affords us the opportunity to keep our overhead carefully in line, to keep our construction costs really at low levels, to deliver the options and upgrades that people are looking for and that they place value on and to keep our pricing structure very value oriented so that it appeals to the greatest number of consumers. And I think that operating strategy is an important component of what's driving our margins right now.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My first question relates to your commentary about pricing. I was particularly intrigued by that because it's something that we've observed in the marketplace as well, the willingness and the ability of builders to put through price increases with an increase in volume. Can you give us a sense for your strategy for implementing price increases? And can you provide a little bit more color as to how isolated the opportunities are to raise prices in the marketplace? And by price increases, by the way, I should specify I'm not just talking about nominal price increases, I'm also talking about reduced incentives and increased lot premiums.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Stephen, it's Jon. That's a good point. It comes in both forms, the ability to increase prices, as well as to reduce incentives. It really varies at this point in the market recovery market by market. We're seeing in some of our markets the ability to have perhaps over 50% of the community to be able achieve one of those advantages and then in other markets they're still in the 10% to 15% range. But strategically, we're trying to implement at least some level of price improvement so that we deliver that message of confidence both internally and externally.
Richard Beckwitt: From a strategy standpoint, Steve, we look at each community as a separate profit center, and we know from looking at the market demand, where the lines cross with regard to pushing absorption versus raising prices. In communities where we have a longer land position, we benefit more by increasing the prices, getting the appraisals up because our margins will be better on a long-term basis. So we look at each one individually. Across the board, we have instituted price increases in probably most of the communities or taken incentives down. There's a handful of ones that are still a little bit challenged from a price standpoint, but we will be aggressively moving prices, particularly because it allows us to pull people off of the fence.
Stuart A. Miller: And additionally, land is harder and harder to replace. We don't want to leave opportunity on the table by selling through quickly land positions that are particularly well located.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, all of that makes a tremendous amount of sense. Follow-up question relates to your commentary about incremental margin. I think you said somewhere in the vicinity of 16.5% incremental operating margin. You were talking primarily there on the power of leveraging of SG&A it seems like. I was curious as to whether you could comment on your -- the degree to which that incremental margin may actually be higher as you migrate into communities, which are not Everything's Included or if, in fact, it would have a negative impact on your contribution margin. What is your view on how an Everything's Included strategy and the extremely high backlog conversion ratio that comes with that would contrast with a more standard kind of option-type package as we go forward?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, let's see if I can break that down. The 16% incremental margin derives from additional deliveries in existing communities. And so it's where we're growing from 2 sales per month to 3 sales per month, the incremental overhead is very, very small relative to the 15-ish percent that we're running right now. And so we see a tremendous amount of leverage in the growth of sales per community. So certainly, within the community, there wouldn't be an introduction of a different operating platform. But right now, all of our communities in at least some modified way are operating under an EI, Everything's Included platform. And so we wouldn't have a sense of -- or a good sense of what the differentiation or the differential in overhead would be for a design studio or option-based program. And I wouldn't venture that guess. I would also highlight, I don't mean to strike a competitive note here, I think that there are operators out there that can operate a design studio approach. In our world, we think that EI is more efficient.
Richard Beckwitt: The main benefit, Steve, from an EI platform really comes through the cost side. We can negotiate better costs on the materials. There's increased cycle time with regarding delivery. There's less mistakes from the trade standpoint in putting the options or upgrades in the wrong location in the home. So it's speed of delivery and the cost of having that asset for the time period that it's on your books.
Stuart A. Miller: But just to add to that, the EI program also does not necessitate a design studio facility. And sometimes, the people overhead associated with that. So it's both on the cost side and the G&A side.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question I just had was on the sales pace, a lot of success there, and it looks like roughly about 40% up year-over-year. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks that referring to March that you see continued strength and similar to the sales pace at the end of the quarter. Was just curious if the sales pace improved throughout the quarter, and we should be looking for even, we're talking about March being higher than the quarter average and if it's possible to kind of give us a degree of magnitude and regionally, what's driving that?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Well, I think if you look at the first quarter, starts off in December, which is impacted by the holidays. And so as I said, we did see that improvement sequentially through the quarter, and so far, March is evidencing consistency with what we saw in February which was...
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But I guess, I'm talking about a year-over-year, not -- sorry to interrupt, but not just sequentially I'm thinking.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, both sequentially and year-over-year on a month-to-month basis, we saw improvement throughout the quarter with February being the strongest month of the quarter. And I think what Jon was trying to highlight is we're seeing similar strength in the stub period so far in March with the strength of the quarter that we had.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. Second question on the DTA, Bruce, just trying to get an update on that. I believe last quarter, you said it's, and correct me if I'm wrong, but something that you might be looking at on a quarter-to-quarter basis and doesn't necessarily have to be reversed at the end of your fiscal year. Is that still the case? And can you give us any updated thinking about that in terms of maybe what hurdles you need to cross to get that back on the balance sheet?
Bruce E. Gross: Sure. As we came out of the end of the year, the feeling was that we needed more discernible evidence that housing was recovering and the feeling was that we needed to give some time to go through the spring to see if that's the case. That was the biggest item. So if the company keeps its performance up and housing recovers through the spring, similar to what we're seeing here in February and March, I think there's a good chance that we'll be able to reverse the DTA as early as the second quarter, but certainly, we believe it will happen within this year.
Stuart A. Miller: Just as a kind of reminder, what we said is that the reversal of the DTA was more a question of the macro market than it was focused just on Lennar specific in our case. We've been able to demonstrate profitability for an extended period of time now. The question that still has been an overhang has been that of where is the macro market going? And I think as there is more evidence of stability in the marketplace, the reversal of the DTA will become more certain.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen East of ISI Group.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: The overview in your prepared comments was really helpful. It answered a lot of the questions I think. So on the land side, beyond what you talked about right now, is the profitability that you're seeing in the deals today similar to what you saw, what you had, at least pro forma over the last 3 years that are part of the 48% of your sales right now?
Richard Beckwitt: It depends on the deal. Clearly, the deals that are option oriented, finished home site, the margins are less in those opportunities. To the extent that we're doing transactions that incorporate bond purchases and things that are more complicated, we're still seeing great margins in those opportunities.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then if we look at the cash, you all did spend a lot on development. You've got some debt due in coming in '13 and '14. Your equity is run a lot. You still, it sounds like, have a lot of opportunities to buy more land. Where do you think you wind up this year in cash and how do you envision either retiring or rolling your debt that you got coming in '13 and '14?
Bruce E. Gross: Stephen, this is Bruce. We feel very comfortable with our cash position today. The ending cash balance at the end of the year is going to be dependent on the additional opportunities we see with respect to land purchases through the year, what we decide to go forward with or not, as well as whether or not we have a revolving credit facility in place, which we do expect is likely to come soon. So we feel pretty comfortable on the liquidity side and on the debt maturity ladder side, you can expect that we'll continue to push out debt maturities or we'll use cash to pay down upcoming maturities.
Stuart A. Miller: Additionally, I just want to highlight that I've noted in my comments this morning and before that as we get towards the end of this year, we expect that some of the earlier investments that were made on balance sheet through Rialto will begin to cash flow more consistently. That's beyond the earnings statement, pure cash flow, that cash will start return to corporate. So that really helps our cash position as well.
Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division: Okay, I've got you. If you look at the earnings power for Rialto in '12 or '13, can you put any type of framework around that?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, Rialto, as we've noted so many times before, is very difficult to put a number on. It's in large part because it is an opportunistic business where we focus on maximizing profitability from the assets that we've purchased. And as markets start to recover, the assets that we currently have accumulate greater value, and we want to carefully manage to maximize the return. So it's a lot of a timing issue, Stephen, and we're just – we're going to avoid giving guidance, but say that we're continuing to be very comfortable with the underwriting that we began with and where Rialto is going.
Operator: The next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall of RBC.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Question, massive increase in sales, I was hoping maybe Bruce could give us some insight into what your thinking would be a normalized level of SG&A spending if orders remain in the current trajectory?
Bruce E. Gross: Well, let me just say, Bob, that if you go back over the last decade before the peak, we were used to running our SG&A expenses as a percent of home sales in the 10% range. So once you get back to a normalized, let's say, around 4 per community per month, that's where we would expect to get to as far as our SG&A levels. Now we're not currently at the 4 per month, but that's where we expect to get to.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Is that something that's realistic to expect by end of year?
Bruce E. Gross: It depends on the market. It's hard to tell. The trend is going in the right direction, whether or not we get to a normalized pace by the end of the year, we'll have to wait and see.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I think in the prepared remarks, it was noted that 45% of unit count that's being sold was purchased on land that was acquired in 2009 or afterwards. I wanted to understand, what do you think by year end that mix shift will be, will it be 50% or 60% or do you have an idea that you could provide us?
Bruce E. Gross: It'll be probably just shy of 50%.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: My first question, Stuart, in past conversations and I think on the last call, you talked about mortgage market liquidity. You talked about underwriting standards, and there seemed to be some optimism that underwriting standards might loosen as we look forward. Now it doesn't feel to us like we've seen much change in underwriting in the past 3 months. I'm wondering if you're more optimistic than you've been before that you're going to start to see maybe looser underwriting as we move through the year?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, that's a tricky question, David. You've seen FHA come out with new standards that are really going in the opposite direction where we think there's going to be some tightening down. So it's going to be a mixed picture. I do think we're going to see some reversion to normalized underwriting standards. It wasn't too long ago that someone that didn't have a 700 FICO score just wasn't going to get an approval. And in today's world, we are seeing approvals with lower FICO scores. Now there are a lot more details that go into all of that. But the movement has been in the direction towards a more normalized underwriting standard. With that said, there will be some tightening at the margin. The market will adjust. I think that the driver today relative to mortgages and demand in general is the fact that the appetite for people to move back into for-sale housing is very strong. And customers are starting to alter their credit landscape, their personal credit landscape and whether it means getting some additional savings for additional down payment, getting a gift from parents to afford additional down payment, cleaning up their credit card balances, improving their credit scores, getting past the 2-year window for a short sale or 3-year for a foreclosure. Whatever it is, people are pushing hard today, harder today to fit within the windows of credit standards and credit standards are getting more towards normal. So it's hard to really say that there's going to be loosening or how it's going to loosen. But it seems that the pressure from the market, together with the lending world's moderation is going to get us to a better demand picture.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. My follow-up, and maybe this is for Rick, and realize this is kind of a -- maybe a vague question or difficult question to ask, but a lot of folks are looking at the new land acquisitions and talking about margin trends on new land acquisitions and pricing. I was hoping we could think about bit a different way, of the land that you kind of put under contract of either option or you've bought outright in the last say, x quarters, whatever you want to say, I'm wondering what percentage of it do you think is deemed bought below replacement cost? In other words, the 200 basis point of additional gross margin you're getting on new lots versus old lots, how much of that is just because the market is giving you enough distressed opportunities to buy land below replacement cost? And at some point in the future possibly if we ever saw land prices go back to replacement cost without home price appreciation, that would just come from land prices going up essentially would cut down some of that margin?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, it's a very interesting question because at some point in the cycle, we're going to come across some of the communities where you can buy the asset, still at a price that's lower than what the infrastructure cost is on that's put into that community. But they just don't pencil out yet today. The thing to keep in mind as you look at our land purchases, and this may be different for some of the competitors out there, is the pipeline of activity that we've had, as I highlighted today, these deals that came on in the first quarter were really priced and brought on 2 years ago. So this 3,500, 4,500 homesites of things that really came on in Q1 were priced a long time ago. So were going to get the benefit of that gross margin differential for a while. As we look forward, depending on what is happening in the sales environment and price appreciation, which will come as there's more and more activity and homebuyers are out there, we think it'll get to be more of a normalized land environment where you can make a good building margin and you make your margin, extra margin when you do some development.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask a broader market question. Do you believe new home sales could start to evidence the potential to eventually outperform resales as evidenced either through your results or other major builders? Do you think this is a function of communities that you're able to open in better markets? Because over the past 2 years, we've seen the share of new home sales fall to below historic normal levels, just how do you view this market developing?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, look, we're going to have to let the market unfold a little bit to see how it actually works out, but there are a lot of existing homes on the market right now in secondary locations that are trading at very low prices. There's still a tremendous amount of investor activity in the inner-city and outer city locations that is driving volume of existing home sales. I think that as new homes are developed in and around the pockets of real activity where supply is constrained, new homes will start to regain their footing relative to existing homes. You're right in terms of number, both in terms of number and in terms of pricing, new homes have kind of lagged position relative to existing homes or their historic position relative to existing homes. We think, it feels like that trend is starting to turn a little bit, but we're going to have to give it a little bit of time to see.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just on raw materials, a clarification, does your gross margin guidance account for potential price increases you're seeing? And what kind of visibility do have into construction costs a couple of quarters from now?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: As I noted, we believe that with price improvement, our sales price, combined with our purchasing program where we've built in long-lasting value engineered opportunities, that we'll be able to offset that pricing pressure. So we see margins relatively staying in a range as we look forward, 19.5% to 21%, and being able to offset that pressure that you talked about.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jack Micenko of SIG.
Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Most have been asked and answered. Just wanted to revisit the Rialto REO expense line for a minute. I know it's lumpy. I know it's hard to predict, I know it's -- you don't know what's coming in and it's part of the strategy. But the $12 million number, is that -- I'm trying to figure out how much of that is maybe some catch up or was there an accrual in there? Or should we think about that number being a real number, a real part of the cost structure going forward at least until you begin to slow down and do more restructuring versus REO?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Well, there clearly is a -- this is Jeff. There clearly is a catch-up component to that because when you take title to some of these assets, you do have your prior year taxes that you're going to pay and then there's also improvement cost that you might put in, in order to get the assets ready for sale. So some of that is upfront. Some of that is upfront expense.
Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: There's no way to quantify what maybe percentage of the mix that would have been in the quarter or anything like that?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: No, not really. But the property tax component, the majority of that does relate to prior year's taxes. So clearly, that's not a recurring piece. But it's a little hard to try to quantify what a run rate is if that's what you're trying to get to.
Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Yes, that's what we were looking at. And then just real quick as a follow-up, can you compare average down payment and FICO in this quarter on the orders versus maybe a year ago?
Bruce E. Gross: Versus a year ago, there hasn't been much change. It's remained in the low 700s. It's been very consistent over the last year, not much change, and down payment hasn't changed overall for the company average either. It's been very consistent over the last year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I just want to get a better understanding of gross margin. Bruce, was the $2 million of impairments you've mentioned, was that in cost of goods?
Bruce E. Gross: That's all in cost of goods this year. That's correct.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And so if I were to adjust last year's gross margin and this year's gross margin to reflect those and just look at a pre-impairment gross margin year-over-year, looks like it was pretty flat, yet you had some real solid revenue growth and incentives were flat. So I was wondering if you could just address what some of the negative offsets were year-over-year within cost of goods?
Bruce E. Gross: So if you were to strip out the $2 million, the gross margin was 21.3% versus prior year's pre-impairment was 21.1%. So it was at the high end of the range that we've given, and it's up about 20 basis points over last year, if you were to strip out impairments.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. What I was getting at -- I would have expected, given the revenue increase, maybe a little bit more expansion, so I was just wondering what the negative offsets were to the operating leverage on the revenue side?
Bruce E. Gross: So first quarter did increase as far as revenue goes, but I think that's at the high end of the expectations that we had. So I wouldn't really view that there were any negatives that came through this quarter.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Can I ask you on backlog, it's the highest it's been really in -- since 2008, and so I would think your ability now to cover your fixed costs out of backlog is going to be a lot improved, and in some ways, that could negate a bit the need to build spec home and do the even floor production a little bit. So I was wondering if, as the backlog stays at this level or continues to grow, should we expect any decline in spec building or decline in backlog turnover?
Bruce E. Gross: Actually, if you look at the statistics I gave this quarter, you did see a decline in terms of the number of homes under construction that are unsold. So we are starting to see that, which is very helpful, because incentives tend to be a little bit lower on homes that are sold before they're started. So this quarter again, there were 1,523 homes under construction that were sold and 2,293 that were unsold. That's a higher percentage of sold homes than we've seen in quite a while.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. If the trend continues and we're able to continue to build backlog and what you're saying, we'll start to see more evidence of we'll be able to grow our margins more effectively, greater backlog and less pressure on moving spec inventory quickly.
Operator: The next question is coming from Megan McGrath, MKM Partners.
Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. I wanted to ask you a little bit on appraisals, we're hearing from some builders that it does feel like appraisals are moving in your direction, recently maybe because of lower REO inventory. So I'd love to hear your take on that and if that's one of the reasons you feel like you're getting some pricing power back into the market?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: I think in most markets, we are seeing a lessening of the issue with appraisals coming in. There tends to be some differences in markets or in type of appraisal. A VA appraisal is different than some of the other ones. But generally speaking, we are seeing an improvement and less issues at the closing.
Stuart A. Miller: It's kind of a natural phenomenon in the better markets. There are fewer distressed sales to be found nearby, so you're going to have better comps included in the appraisal, and we're definitely seeing less issue with appraisals.
Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division: Great. And then just sort of a bigger picture question. We've heard probably over the past 6 or 9 months about builders sort of shifting away from the first-time buyer and more to the move-up buyer, but some of the comments you make about household formation improving and getting better make me -- and about the anecdotal story about someone moving out of their parent's basement makes me think that the incremental buyer really is the first-time buyer. Is that true? And do you want to stay more focused on the first-time buyer? Or how do you see your product mix changing over the next year?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, we feel that a well-balanced program between both buyer groups is the way to really be because there's going to be constant movement from first to second, and what we're really focused on is finding the right communities for the people that are buying homes, whether it's first or second. There's no question that there is pent-up demand on the first-time buyer program. But you got to be really careful to make sure that you're positioning your product in the right locations and have it priced at a point where they can qualify for those loans.
Stuart A. Miller: And I just want to highlight that we didn't say that they were living in the basement.
Operator: And our last question is coming from Dan Oppenheim, Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Was wondering if you can talk a bit about the opportunity for Rialto as you see it. You had the business for several years now. Environment's getting a bit better, credit's more available and more competition out there, how much more do you see in terms of the opportunity for that business and the capital that you have, if you can describe that, start with that?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Yes, I think I -- this is Jeff. I mentioned, I touched on it a little bit in the prepared remarks and the fact that in terms of the pressure, a lot of these lenders want to get back into the lending business, and they still have a lot of these assets that are still overhanging. So we see the distressed side of the business on the opportunistic side continuing for some period of time. But while saying that, we also see sort of a reformation of the capital markets and a lot of the skills that Rialto has developed just is very similar to what we did back in the days of LNR. A lot of those skills apply as the markets come out, and as capital market reform in terms of being a liquidity provider and using those same skill sets in terms of making nonperforming loans perform again or dealing with the underlying real estate. So we see it as a growing opportunity. There's still 3 -- there's still, over the next 3 years, $1 trillion of commercial real estate debt that's going to be coming due. And something's got to be done with all of it.
Stuart A. Miller: But with that said, Dan, I think you properly highlight that distress is a depleting opportunity base. And we've recognized that from the beginning. Rialto and its distressed program is a terrific platform on which to build a management team and an operating group that is well prepared to pivot into very different lines of business. You're already seeing that with our entry back into the CMBS business. Within the opportunity fund, we're buying B pieces as we did in the old LNR days. And we're starting to grow new business lines that will take the place of the existing distressed business, but build on the strength of the management team that has been put together in that context.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Great. And I guess one final thing, was wondering in terms of the focus, in terms of the homebuilding operations, when you think about the potential for incremental margins by improvement in absorption versus working to lift pricing in some of these communities, how are you balancing that in terms of just where would you like to get that in terms of the sales per community? Or is it now shifting in terms of, at this level you're pushing more in terms of price versus the absorption?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. It will – as we've said, it will vary community by community. Where land positions are tight, we'll look to obviously maximize price as much as possible and find that balance of a norm absorption of one a week. To having pricing pressure, I think you'll see as the markets continue to recover, we'll have the ability to both improve pricing and absorptions, but we will look at it on a community-by-community basis to be able to maximize our profitability.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay. So listen, thanks, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter review. I know we took a little bit more time, but we felt that given the way that the national debt is being reported and some of the questions that you all have voiced, it was worth spending a little bit of extra time. If there are additional questions, of course, you can give us a call. We appreciate your attention. Thank you.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart A. Miller: Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter and year-end 2011 update. We're very pleased to detail our results for you this morning. As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment are here to participate as well, as we have all just been together and completed our year-end review of our -- and our 2012 look-ahead with our regional and division presidents here in Miami.  I'm going to begin this morning with some brief opening remarks about the state of the current housing market in general. Rick and Jon will comment on aspects of Lennar's homebuilding operation. Jeff will update performance in our Rialto segment. And finally, Bruce will provide detail on our quarter and year-end numbers. After Bruce, of course we'll open the phone lines to your questions. And we request, as always, that in our Q&A period that everyone please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to everybody who'd like to ask.  So 2 days ago on CNBC, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan highlighted that he believed that housing was at or nearing the bottom of this downturn, and I believe he's correct. I previewed in our third quarter conference call 3 months ago that we were beginning to see evidence of a genuine turn in residential and the residential housing market, and that this could be a harbinger of market stability. Last quarter, I was not ready to conclude that a real trend had been identified. This quarter, I'm feeling somewhat more confident that the market is, in fact, changing.  As I noted earlier, we have just completed our 2-day review of all of operating divisions across the country. We've looked back at our 2011 results, and we've looked ahead to 2012 expectations. The consistent message is that the general environment is different this year than it has been in the past. There are discernible fundamental shifts appearing in the home market, and there are empirical compliments that are to date confirmatory that the market is showing signs of stability.  Home prices and volumes have been falling for 7 years now. Prices are down some 20% to 50% depending on the market, and new home starts and sales are at post-depression lows. Concurrently, interest rates are at historic lows. According to HUD, homes are more affordable to purchase today than they've been since 1971 as a result of these falling home prices and low interest rates. Today's consumers are beginning to realize that housing represents an undeniable value proposition. And accordingly, demand is growing and we are seeing it in the field at most of our communities.  Now demand is constrained by the mortgage qualification standards and processes that define today's mortgage market, and that has been overcorrected by the severity of the downturn. But the demand is growing and looking to find some loosening of those credit standards. Today's consumer is looking at the home purchase differently than in the past -- in past years. The home purchase is no longer the place to invest savings in order to ride a wave of price increases. Instead, today's buyers are looking for real value, and they're finding real value in for-sale housing.  First, the fully loaded cost of ownership is lower in most desirable markets than comparable rental rates. While this might not show up in national statistics, in local competitive markets, principal, interest, taxes, insurance, community association costs and lawn care are together lower than the competitive rental market. Today, for-sale housing represents an excellent value proposition.  Secondly, they are looking for an alternative to the rental market. Rental prices are high and they've been moving up, and they reprice every 12 months. Today's consumers are looking for a domicile that provides living cost stability, as well as stable and a safe place to raise a family. They are looking to reconsider the rental lifestyle where rental rates have been rising and are likely to continue to rise for the foreseeable future.  In our fourth quarter, we've seen real evidence of these changes in the field. We are experiencing more traffic in our welcome home centers, and customers are actively discussing their desire to find a way to purchase and avoid the rental market and its repricing. Perhaps most importantly, we've seen consistent sales pace at stabilized prices throughout our fourth quarter and even through December, during the season that is generally the most difficult time of the year. Our steady traffic and sales rate indicate stronger demand trend than prior years when sales just dropped off at this time of the year.  New orders are up 20% over last year, and our backlog is up 35% over last year. These improved results come with prices and margins that are consistent with or marginally better than our current deliveries, which indicates that we are not and have not been reaching for volume. It is likely that the national members will not reflect these results because they will incorporate in their data many tertiary markets that did not affect our competitive landscape. But the more desirable housing markets are experiencing a fundamental change as foreclosure inventories have been absorbed in these markets and the consumer recognizes the value proposition. This is the consistent message from our divisions, reflecting their interactions in the field.  Now let me give you a few brief comments on our fourth quarter and year end. It's well documented that 2011 has been another difficult year for the housing market. Prices continued to decline across the country by another 4-plus percent, while the volume of new homes sold in the U.S. has remained at historically low levels. Against this backdrop, we've performed consistently on all fronts. All of our business segments, Homebuilding, Financial Services and Rialto, have remained profitable in the quarter and for the year, producing $0.16 for the quarter and $0.48 for the year. Most importantly, the basic metrics that define our business have been carefully managed through this difficult year. Margins have remained consistently high and we expect will remain in the 19.5% to 21.5% range in 2012. SG&A has been improving through the year and was at 13.8% for the quarter. Average sales price has been steady at about $243,000, while incentives have been declining. Alongside of our Homebuilding activities, our Financial Services group has also been holding steady and positioning for recovery while remaining profitable as well.  Our Rialto segment has also produced consistent profit as it's grown through a turbulent year. While Rialto earnings have been clouded by mark-to-market adjustments relative to our PPIP securities program, with these adjustments stripped away, we are starting to see the real earnings power of the Rialto machine. Rialto completed its money raised for its first fund in Q4 and ended with a $700 million pool of capital to invest in strategic assets to drive its future. To date, about 70% of that fund is invested and the pipeline for new investments is strong. As we look ahead, Rialto should continue to be a solid earnings contributor for Lennar and will begin to return cash to corporate as it is now investing self-generated funds.  All in all, 2011 has been an excellent year for Lennar as we have navigated the turbulent waters of the housing market and the U.S. economy, seeking a bottom and grasping for stability. Our strategy has been to refine and position our company for recovery and remain marginally profitable while we stay patient, and we've done exactly that. All of the segments of our company are extremely well positioned as you will now hear from our operating team. As I look ahead to 2012, I am cautiously optimistic that we are seeing a real bottom form and that we will begin to see signs of recovery.  National statistics and news will give us mixed signals as we move through the year, as they represent a compendium of all of the best and the worst markets around the country. But I feel that stabilization and recovery will emanate from the most desirable markets and spread slowly outward over years. Lennar is positioned with a strong balance sheet in the right market, with an exceptional management team and a well-constructed strategy to perform solidly as market conditions begin to improve.  With that, let me turn over to Rick Beckwitt.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Stuart. During the fourth quarter, we continue to focus on acquiring or auctioning new homesites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. Our primary focus was pursuing distressed opportunities, and we spent a lot of time in one-on-one negotiations with banks and other extremely motivated sellers. This quarter, we purchased approximately 3,800 homesites totaling approximately $162 million, and we spent approximately $56 million on land development. In addition, we auctioned almost 1,100 homesites.  Our new acquisitions were located in markets where we saw the greatest market strength and value proposition. Our focus within these markets has been on highly desirable communities located in sub-markets where people really want to live and where foreclosed homes have already been absorbed. Whether the hook is schools, spectacular amenities, commute time, each one of these new deals has been hand selected with a very specific target buyer and product in mind. In short, we invested in A-plus assets and stayed away from the fringe or tertiary locations where price was the only driver and where foreclosure activity remains. We also have insisted that we have a cost-effective home design in hand before we buy any land, which has allowed us to streamline the time period between when we buy land and when we're open for sale. It's been a true cash-on-cash focus.  From a geographic standpoint, during the fourth quarter approximately 33% of our new acquisitions were located in Florida, 19% in the Carolinas, 14% in Maryland and Virginia, 11% in California, 10% in Texas, with the remaining 13% spread throughout our other markets. As in prior quarters, the lion's share of our new land deals were sourced outside of a competitive bid environment. We've stayed away from the typical broker-to-bid type deals and rolled up our sleeves and directly sourced of the majority of our land transactions.  In many of our acquisitions, with the help of our Rialto operation, we have purchased debt at a deep discount and subsequently foreclosed on real estate at an incredibly attractive land basis. We have also backed into land through the purchase of community development district farms, tax certificates, deed in lieus and short sale arrangements. In fact, some of the more complicated and unique transactions have created the most upside earnings potential. Regardless of how each deal was sourced, all of our new deals in the quarter were underwritten with extremely conservative assumptions. As in the past, they have assumed no price appreciation and in many cases, price declines and slower absorption basis. In all of these deals, we have required gross margins to exceed 20% and IRRs to exceed 20%.  To date, we've been extremely pleased with the performance of our new land acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, approximately 41% of our deliveries came from communities purchased to put under contract during the last 3 years. Our gross margin on the closings in these communities was approximately 200 basis points higher than the gross margin for the entire company in the fourth quarter.  Outside of our traditional land acquisition activities, in late December, we expanded our operations into the Pacific Northwest through the acquisition of a portfolio of communities from Seattle-based Premier Communities. Led by Ryan McGowan, Premier has been delivering homes and developing land in the Seattle area for several decades. We now own and control approximately 855 homesites in 23 communities. These communities are ideally situated in a very tight and constrained land market. We are extremely excited with the prospects of this new operation and welcome Ryan and his team to the Lennar family.  Before I turn it over to Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, let me give you some final stats. On a year-over-year basis, our inventory increased about $300 million to approximately $4 billion and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned and an approximately $14 million investment in Seattle in the first quarter of 2012. Since the beginning of 2009 when we really started our land acquisition efforts, we've invested over $1.5 billion to purchase approximately 32,700 homesites.  In addition, we have auctioned several thousand additional homesites during this period. As reflected in our industry-leading gross margins, which have increased significantly during this time period, there can be no question that we've invested wisely. At November 30, we owned and controlled 111,386 homesites and had 422 active committees. As we move through 2012, you should see a 5% to 10% increase in our community count and a continued positive contribution to our operating margins from our new investments.  I'd like to thank our Lennar and Rialto associates for their hard work during 2011. I have no doubt that we have the most talented team in the business.  I'd like Jon to now talk about the operations.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Thank you, Rick, and good morning. We are very proud of the pre-impairment 21.6% gross margin and 7.8% operating margin we delivered in our fourth quarter, respectively, 80 and 110 basis point improvements. This achievement did not come about without a lot of focus and attention by management on each of the component parts of our business. I would like to speak to our company strategy on maximizing sales and margins, our intense focus on managing direct costs and our overall focus on leveraging our operating structure to reduce overhead levels. Our sales focus remains a market by market, community by community understanding of today's home-buying consumers' wants and needs.  Through the execution of our Everything's Included platform, we deliver value by targeting the right product and features in every community. Each Lennar division offers home designs, square footages and included features that present a great value to the homebuyer. Lennar's Everything's Included approach is especially effective as we compete against resales by highlighting the energy-efficient, technological and quality features that demonstrate there's nothing like new when it comes to buying a home.  Much of our sales strength in the fourth quarter was driven by the performance of our new communities where we are achieving a higher sales pace as compared to our legacy communities. These new communities are well located, properly positioned and priced to appeal to today's homebuyers. As Rick noted, 41% of our deliveries were from new communities. New orders from these same new communities increased from 27% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 44% in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Overall, as Stuart mentioned, we are seeing better traffic both in terms of quality and quantity, but more so from the quality perspective, representing the customer desire to make a buying decision now. While we are seeing these better patterns, we also continued to experience a very difficult mortgage approval environment, which is restricting the ability of a growing demand to become homebuyers. As the mortgage market eventually corrects itself, we expect more of this demand to be freed up.  In the fourth quarter, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in all of the Florida markets, Atlanta and North Carolina in the Southeast; Phoenix and Vegas in the Southwest; and in parts of California. There was a slight pickup in Houston but overall, Texas was relatively flat. While we don't give data on the current quarter activity, I can tell you that we saw improved year-over-year sales trends through December. And while the year-over-year improvement varies slightly by market from the fourth quarter, every one of our markets showed improvement in December from the prior year.  Our management team is also very focused on the cost side of the margin equation. Our current average direct cost of homes remains around $40 per square foot. We maintained this cost level by value engineering at a more granular level than we have ever before. Our costs are broken down into detailed categories where we measure performance of these categories across all of our divisions. This, combined with detailed and effective management of the building process in the field, has allowed us to keep our costs down by over 30% from the 2006 peak. This has been accomplished this year despite various fluctuations of some materials and commodities. I want to recognize the hard work of our national and local purchasing teams along with our operating divisions for their drive in finding new solutions and implementing new processes that allow us to deliver better quality and value in the home.  We have also maintained our focus on cycle time, which is down almost 30% from the peak. This represents an average build time of between 90 to 100 calendar days for single-family detached homes. We have accomplished this by working hard with our -- hard and hand in hand with our trade partners in designing and building more efficient value-engineered homes. This effort has allowed us to control our field costs and effectively manage the delivery of our inventory.  We have also maintained our intense focus on management of our SG&A. Our SG&A for the fourth quarter was at 13.8%, which is the lowest level we have achieved in 5 years. This represents a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year and begins to show the opportunity to leverage our operating structure. This was accomplished despite the start-up costs associated with our new community growth, as well as the commissions associated with greater broker participation. There is an increasing trend of third-party brokers bringing their buyers to us, which we believe is evidence of the growing awareness of the ease and value of the new home purchase versus resale.  Now I'll put our overhead focus into perspective. The fourth quarter spend of $112 million compares to $484 million in Q4 of 2006. As Stuart and Rick have mentioned, we have just completed our operations reviews with each of our Homebuilding divisions. Across-the-board, we have a team that is energized to execute on our strategy of maximizing sales revenue, reducing the cost of sales and delivering industry-leading operating margins.  Thank you, and I'd now like to turn it over to Jeff Krasnoff.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. As Stuart mentioned in his opening remarks, Rialto is beginning to hit its stride and demonstrate its earnings capacity. Before Bruce reviews the details behind Rialto's $8 million of operating earnings along with the results of the rest of the company, there are a few areas that might be helpful to touch on to give you a little bit more perspective on what's going on at Rialto.  With the backdrop of uncertainty in Europe, we've nonetheless continued to see what amounts to positive dynamics for the new deal flow in the markets in which we operate. U.S. banks are still under pressure to sell real estate assets, and the prospected foreign banks will also be shedding assets since added further downward pressure on the pricing of many opportunities especially where we believe we continue to have a competitive advantage. Therefore, the opportunity to purchase both real estate back loans and securities is as strong, if not stronger than ever. And we remain focused on evaluating. And if we can continue to price advantageously acquiring distressed portfolios, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other related assets through our current exclusive investment vehicle, the Rialto Real Estate Fund.  As Stuart mentioned, during the quarter the fund had its final closing of equity commitments, bringing the total to $700 million, including the $75 million commitment from us and from over 2 dozen different investor groups. The fund has now been able to acquire or tie up a total of 28 different negotiated transactions, and our pipeline of new potential investments remains strong. This has resulted in the investment of a little over $500 million of fund equity to acquire almost $1.5 billion of assets based on unpaid principal balance, for about $0.37 on the dollar. And now with about $200 million of equity remaining to be called, we're currently focusing on bringing out our next investment fund. We believe these in future vehicles will not only help to enhance the company's returns and add consistent cash flows back to corporate, but will also be important building blocks for us to develop a first-class Investment Management business.  Almost 75% of our fund investments so far have been distressed portfolios from regional and community banks, CMBS special servicers and non-bank financial institutions. The remaining investments are in new issue CMBS securities with strong current cash flows, where we have found risk-adjusted pricing dynamics unlike any we have seen since the early days of that business dating back to the mid-1990s.  Our focused Rialto team of 180 strong continues to push the resolution process forward, enhanced by the well-coordinated resources of the rest of the Lennar team. Being able to integrate the unique talents of a leading nationwide residential developer and homebuilder has been and continues to be a unique advantage for us. And in turn, as part of this active collaboration led by Eric Feder who oversees our bank relationships, the Homebuilding divisions have been able to continue to capture distressed opportunities from the same institutions we have been working with on the portfolios. As you have heard, this is providing a great mechanism to generate new communities for homebuilding at extremely attractive pricing.  Since we began investing in distressed assets, at the end of the first quarter of 2010 we have, as of now, collected gross over $550 million of cash, including over $120 million from the sales of real estate owned. Included as part of this, the FDIC transaction partnerships now hold over $320 million of cash on their balance sheets, including approximately $260 million earmarked to defease the $627 million of FDIC seller financing.  Market uncertainty has been responsible for keeping us from having one of our most profitable quarters yet as a result of the $7.6 million unrealized loss related to our share of the mark-to-market on our PPIP fund. And for the year these marks have aggregated $21.4 million. However, these marks as required by U.S. Treasury, we believe, reflect more of the general sentiment in the marketplace related to the potential need for European banks to liquidate fixed income assets. We have not changed our view of the resilient underlying cash flows that we used to underwrite and price our PPIP investments. In fact, our PPIP fund has been actively looking to acquire additional securities. And to date, exclusive of the marks, we've already recognized approximately $23 million in interest income and fees related to our $68 million investment in and management of the fund.  So these are just a few of the reasons we remain very excited about the continued progress of our Rialto franchise, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team.  Thank you, and I'll turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce E. Gross: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. This is our seventh consecutive quarter of profitability, and our fourth quarter results reflect strong core operating earnings that were partially offset by Homebuilding impairments of $17.9 million and a PPIP mark-to-market that Jeff discussed. That's an unrealized loss of $7.6 million.  Let me review the numbers in all 3 segments, starting with Homebuilding. Revenues from home sales increased 13% to $817 million, driven by a 10% increase in wholly owned deliveries and a 2% increase in average sales price to $243,000. The average sales price by region is as follows, and please note that we were required to change our reportable segments this quarter as noted in our press release, so you will see a new Southeast Florida region while Georgia and the Carolinas have moved from the other region to the East region. East average sales price was $221,000, up 3%; Southeast Florida was $265,000, up 1%; Central was $211,000, up 2%; Houston $228,000, up 5%; West $307,000, down 3%; and other was $339,000, down 9%.  As was mentioned, our gross margin on home sales before impairments was 21.6% in the fourth quarter, which was an 80 basis point improvement compared to the prior year. In our last conference call, we provided a gross margin percentage range for the fourth quarter before impairments of 19% to 21%. We exceeded this range due to delivery of more favorable product mix of higher gross margin percentage deliveries, which includes an increasing percentage of deliveries from new communities that was mentioned, and that's now 41% of our deliveries.  The gross margins were strongest in the East and the Southeast Florida regions this quarter. Sales incentives as a percentage of home sale revenue decreased 20 basis points to 12.2% in the fourth quarter versus 12.4% in the prior year. As a result of the strong gross margins that were mentioned and the improvement in SG&A that Jon discussed, our Homebuilding operating margins before impairment improved 110 basis points from the prior year to 7.8%.  During the quarter, we recognized the $4.7 million net gain relating to an asset distribution from a JV. This was a linked transaction reflected on 2 income statement lines, earnings from unconsolidated entities and other income. When a joint venture determines it is disposing of assets, it needs to evaluate the assets at the lower of cost or market. As a result, the joint venture was required to book an impairment. The company's share of this joint venture impairment was $57.6 million charge. As part of the joint venture distribution, the company received assets that were fair valued above its remaining investment account balance, and that resulted in the $62.3 million gain. The impairments during the quarter on the Homebuilding side were $17.9 million, and that compares to $22.3 million in the prior year.  Turning to Financial Services, that business segment generated operating earnings of $9.1 million versus $11.7 million last year. Mortgage pretax income was $9.1 million versus $11.1 million in the prior year. And during the quarter, we successfully entered into another confidential settlement with the second of the 3 large banks that purchased the vast majority of our mortgage originations. This settlement which totaled $2 million was within the accrued liability on our books for a potential mortgage put-back exposure, and we now have a remaining liability of approximately $6 million. And we are comfortable that that's adequate for any future exposure. Our title company generated $1.5 million of profits versus $1 million in the prior year. And additionally, the Financial Services result include a $1.3 million reserve for the disposition of our last remaining cable system.  As Jeff mentioned, our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $8 million, and this number includes $2 million of net losses attributable to non-controlling interest. Rialto's operating earnings before the PPIP mark-to-market adjustments have showed significant improvement, growing to $15.6 million during the quarter versus $7.7 million in the prior year, netting out the prior year's PPIP mark-to-market gain. The composition of Rialto's $8 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: the FDIC portfolio contribution this quarter was breakeven; the non-FDIC portfolios generated a $17.3 million gain; PPIP, net of interest income and the mark-to-market had a $4.8 million loss; and there were $2 million contributed from the Rialto Real Estate Fund. This was offset by approximately $6.4 million of general and administrative expenses, which is net of management fees and reimbursements of approximately $3.7 million.  Although revenue from the FDIC portfolios were higher in the fourth quarter versus the prior year, we experienced higher expenses relating primarily to property taxes and legal expenses relating to both servicing loans and REO, resulting in the breakeven quarter for the FDIC portfolios. The $17.3 million contribution from the non-FDIC portfolios this quarter are primarily from deficiency recoveries, accretable interest income, gains upon foreclosure and sales of REO net of REO expenses. Our 15% interest in the Rialto Real Estate Fund generated approximately $2 million of profits, which is in addition to the management fees highlighted above. The $4.8 million loss during the quarter from our investment in PPIP is reported as equity and earnings from unconsolidated entities, and this loss is comprised of $7.6 million of unrealized loss due to mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by a $2.8 million of interest income.  The success of the Rialto Real Estate Fund has enabled us to grow Rialto using the third-party capital. During the quarter, the company didn't invest any new capital in the Rialto segment. Rialto continues to generate strong cash flow. And at quarter end, there was already $219 million in the defeasance cash account to retire debt, and there was an additional $84 million of cash on Rialto's balance sheet.  The company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of $13.7 million relating to the favorable resolution of certain federal and state tax issues. In computing our earnings per share for the quarter, the add back for interest relating to our convertible debt is $871,000. We concluded the year with a strong liquid balance sheet. Our leverage remained low as our Homebuilding debt to total capital net of the $1 billion of cash was 46.4%. During the quarter, we paid off maturing senior notes of $113 million. There are no maturities now until 2013, and we raised $400 million of new convertible notes with a 3.25% rate and a 37.5% premium and we received $350 million of that cash in the current quarter. Shareholders equity ended the year at $2.7 billion, and that's a book value per share amount of $14.31. This book value per share does not include the fully reserved deferred tax asset which is currently at $577 million or $3.06 per outstanding share.  At year end the company, with the consultation of its auditors, evaluated whether the reserve on its deferred tax asset is still needed. The relevant accounting guidance requires a very high threshold in order to conclude that the reserve is no longer needed. Although the company's strong performance and current positioning is bringing it closer to a conclusion that the reserve is no longer needed, we have concluded to defer a reversal until further evidence that the housing market recovery has been revealed.  We ended 2011 with our strongest quarterly backlog growth since 2002, up 35%. This strong backlog, coupled with our focus on strong gross margin percentages, positions us for another year of profitability in 2012. Stuart indicated we are increasing our gross margin expectations for 2012 to be in a range of 19.5% to 21.5%. And as usual, our first quarter is expected to have seasonally lighter volume and gross margins at the lower end of our range, making it tougher to be profitable in the first quarter. However, we are well positioned and we are looking forward to another year of profitability throughout the remainder of 2012.  And with that, let me open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: You had mentioned, Stuart, some brief comments about rent inflation helping to some extent for people to reevaluate the economics as it relates to owning versus renting. Do you have any data that might support that in terms of serving the traffic cuts coming through, or people that are actually signing sales contracts that are saying they've been renters? And maybe some anecdotes that can help us understand the opportunity? Certainly there's plenty of people that arguably have been delaying purchases that might be a significant opportunity, and I just want to hear your thoughts on that, please.
Stuart A. Miller: Yes. When we talk about data, data gets a little bit convoluted. What we specifically did, Ivy, is we went out and looked at the competitive landscape relative to communities in specific markets. And we actually put together a little presentation on it that we've shared in some of our presentations and we'll probably continue to. And we've looked at the fully loaded cost of homeownership as compared with the rental rates that are in a competitive radius of communities where we are actively selling. So this is real information from real markets where we're competing. Now if you were to broaden the thought -- the radius, if you were to expand the radius, you might find that the data doesn't hold up. But in a real competitive environment at a local level, we're finding that there are 2 things at work. Number one is a value proposition, where fully loaded cost of homeownership is at or lower, and generally lower than the competitive rental communities. And then perhaps more importantly, in the more desirable areas rental prices, which reprice every 12 months, have been trending upward, anywhere from 5% to 15% on selected markets, and it is a combination of the value proposition and the notion that the cost of living expenses are going to go up, are going up and are going to continue to go up that are driving people to say, I've got to lock this expense down or it can run away from me. It is reducing my personal disposable income when wages are not rising. And so it's driving more traffic to our sales centers.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Just to -- I don't want to say this is my follow up question because I'm going to save that one but just to clarify, Stuart, on your analysis, this doesn't also include the benefit assuming the mortgage interest deduction, as well as assuming you're talking comparing apartment renting to single-family ownership, just to clarify? And then I have a follow-up.
Stuart A. Miller: Okay, yes. That's a good clarification, so we won't count it as your follow-up. But we actually decidedly did not include the mortgage interest deduction because of all of the discussion out there that it could be, might be vulnerable. We wanted to take a more pure look as a consumer might look at it. Any time there's a question mark, it might be discounted. Even without the mortgage interest deduction, the comparison is favorable in many communities across the country, ownership versus renting.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. I would also add that seeing surveys, I don't know exactly the group survey, but in realty publications that consistently state that a very high percentage, around 70% of renters do look at homeownership in their future. And I would also just add anecdotally in select markets, I've heard from apartment owners the increasing number of the churn over going to homeownership versus other rentals.
Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: No, we've heard the same, and we did a survey like that, Jon. Maybe you're reading our survey so hopefully, that was the case. But to bring up my second question, Stuart, you've talked about the stringency of mortgage availability. Certainly, everyone recognizes that. But what I'd like you to hopefully clarify to the listeners is that mortgage credit maybe stringent, but I don't believe that there are people that were limited in terms of the pool of people that, assuming confidence comes back, that mortgages are not going to be something that would limit the number of homebuyers. In other words, you grew -- your year-over-year sales were up 20%. Assuming those people are going to close with modest cancellations, I would assume that there's no change favorably to mortgage availability, but you have more confidence that people are stepping into the market. So if I ask you in 3 years from now and you were seeing a pickup in sales activity, would you say there's a limit to how faster sales can grow because of the mortgage stringency? Or is it really more confidence that's limiting you and there's plenty of people that have higher than a 640 FICO score, or that can come up with 5% or 10% down payment, it's just a confidence issue that's really limiting it and certainly, it would help to have easier credit but it doesn't, at least the mortgage companies we talked to, doesn't limit the opportunity to see a recovery in housing?
Stuart A. Miller: Well look, I think I want to be careful not to be guided by your question. But I think that the mortgage market under all circumstances right now is choppy, and the process for mortgage approval is somewhat limiting. There are many people who don't have the qualifications. Some of the -- many of the people that don't have the qualifications are burning off the needed years between a short sale or a bankruptcy or a foreclosure to get to the point where they're allowed to get back into the mortgage market. Some of them are regenerating a good credit score. Some of them are accumulating a down payment. The qualification side of the mortgage market is difficult, it's choppy and it is somewhat limited today, but we are living in a dynamic world where that's changing. At the same time, the process has become intensely cumbersome. The request for documentation seems to be never ending. And the process, together with the qualifications, are the result of an overcorrection. That overcorrection, in my opinion, is going to find a way to burn off, that is the overcorrection is going to find a way to burn off over time. But as with any pendulum swing, it takes some time for the pendulum to find its equilibrium, and I believe it will. So with demand coming to the market in an increased measure and with the mortgage qualification market and process being somewhat stringent and limiting, I think the 2 will work together, increased demand and mortgage market reaching equilibrium. And over time, we're going to see demand really start to peak up. Now whether that's in 2012 or whether it takes more time for the markets to settle and stuff, it's yet to be seen and I don't want to opine on that. But I think that over time, we're going to see demand push through the stringency of the mortgage market.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim, Barclays Capital.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I also believe that you don't -- that the mortgage availability really isn't the primary impediment, that it's primarily an issue of confidence. In that vein, I was wondering if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in traffic relative to the trends that we saw in orders or you are seeing in orders? Are you seeing traffic increase at a faster rate year-over-year or however you choose to look at it relative to orders or vice versa?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: It varies slightly from market to market. But we are, I think in general, seeing traffic increase at a faster rate. But I said earlier that the biggest difference we're seeing is in a greater desire to make the buying decision as compared to prior periods in the year.
Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Yes, that's really great. I guess the second question that I had relates to your subdivision count. In particular, what I'm curious about is you would think you had given guidance that community count being up roughly 5% or so in 2012 but obviously, if what you're seeing now is in fact a harbinger of an improved spring selling season? One would think that you might be tempted to tweak up your subdivision count to capture some of that volume. You having one of those stronger balance sheets in the industry will be better able to do that, one would think. So I was curious if you could give us an idea of your capacity to increase your subdivision count greater than the 5% that you mentioned?
Richard Beckwitt: Steve, it's Rick. There's no question we've got the dry powder to press it up if the opportunities are there. But as you've seen us over the last several years, we've been investing wisely. As the market starts to increase, we're going to get increased absorptions from our existing communities. We'll invest in new communities. And there's no question in my mind that if there are good deals out there, we'll find them first. With regard to community count in 2011, what I can tell you is while we did give guidance through the year that we saw community count would be up, there's a lot of communities that come in and out intra-quarter, either through auction deals where we have very little or no earnest money that you guys don't see. If they're successful, they stay on; if they're not, we move out. But most of those things still add to positive contribution on a net margin basis intra-quarter. So as we look at 2012, we gave guidance for a 5% to 10% increase. I think it'll be every bit of that, but we're going to just invest wisely throughout the year.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question. I was hoping just to get perhaps a little bit more granular on the order trends during the quarter. And it looks like absorption or sales per community actually improved 8%, 10% sequentially versus, I think, as Stuart, you said last year, fell off a little bit as is typical in 4Q versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could kind of take us through if that was driven by a couple of submarkets? Certainly there's huge order growth in Southeast Florida or the fact that as a mix basis, you have a higher percentage of newer communities. I think you said driving 44% of your orders, if that kind of picked up materially from the third quarter? Any more granularity there would be helpful.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Okay. The new orders in the quarter, we indicated about 44% were coming from the new communities. But we've seen most of that success, and I think Jon got into this a bit, coming from more of the new communities that we've been opening. But it's really been throughout the quarter, a success throughout the country. It hasn't been one market that we've experienced the success.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: A little more color. I think that the areas where we saw the greatest improvement in sales from new communities, as we mentioned, was Southeast Florida, but also in central Florida and the Raleigh area, as an example. In Dallas-Fort Worth and then Texas, we saw that pickup. And Orange County, California, in Colorado, markets like that we had dramatic increases and our activity in our new communities year-over-year.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. I guess the second question just on the gross margins. It looks like you're kind of increasing the range that you think is possible by maybe 50 bps or more. And this quarter, you exceeded the range that you had guided to in terms of 21.6% over the 21% high end of the range. Is there any reason to think that you wouldn't be able to at least achieve the higher end of this range for fiscal '12 outside of any major mixed shift in deliveries maybe by region? Because certainly over the last couple of quarters now, you've been at that high end of the range. Any color there would be helpful, particularly as you kind of pointed to this quarter being also positively influenced by mix?
Stuart A. Miller: Well let me say this, Mike. We've given a range, and I think that that's where we're comfortable right now. There are moving parts, and we are rounding the corner to come into our first quarter. Our first quarter is always lighter volume. We have lower expectations for our first quarter, and we want to make sure that we keep everybody's perspective properly focused on the short-term and the longer-term year-end. So we are giving a range. We did throw out a couple of numbers, and I want to make sure that they're clear. 44% of our new orders came from new communities and 41% of our deliveries came from new communities. So you can see that we have a -- kind of a trend wise, new communities are increasing their representation in the flow or in the composition of our gross margin. But we recognize that our first quarter is likely to be a little bit lighter. So where will we be within that range? We're going to wait and see what the composition brings to us. But we do feel comfortable number one, with the range we put out there; and number 2, with the fact that we did bring the range up by about 50 bps.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Great. One quick follow-up on the first question, if it's possible, on the community count. You were down 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and you're guiding for up 5% to 10% for the full year. Would we expect that 5% to 10% to be more back-half weighted? Or should we expect more of a move in the first quarter?
Bruce E. Gross: As we announced in a press release on the Pacific Northwest, we brought in some additional communities in the Seattle area. So you'll see some community count growth as those start to build out through the year. Most of those opportunities were really land or option contracts that we got to get going in. The Seattle market's a little bit unique. They're smaller communities from an overall size standpoint, so their overall contributions as a whole will be somewhat less. But with regard to the overall year, you'll see it more in the back end half of the year and it's going to be skewed somewhat by what the opportunities are out there.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.
Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: This is Susan on for David today. First of all, I wanted to get your thoughts around some of the recent news that we've seen regarding government efforts to support housing. A week or so ago, the fed came up with a report that suggests the government could be warming up to the idea of allowing some larger, more institutional capital to play perhaps a more meaningful role in the buy-to-rent market. Can you just kind of give us your thoughts on this, and maybe what you think it could indicate in terms of the government supporting different initiatives to help housing?
Stuart A. Miller: Well, there have -- I think that there's been more than just the discussion of the government buy-to-rent program. There's also been part 2.0 that's been out there. The most important thing to think about is the fact that the government is recognizing that stability in the housing market is important, and it's important to refocus the attention on how we enable the housing market to recover. And I think that portends good things for housing in general. Certainly, redeploying some of the idle inventory to the rental market will be helpful. It will bring less supply on the for-sale market and will enable the for-sale market to absorb the overhang of foreclosures more rapidly. It will deploy those assets into much needed rental housing. And anything that the government can do to enable the borrowing -- the borrowers out there to decide not to strategically default will help the foreclosure market begin to resolve itself as well. So our thoughts are that together with fundamental demand coming back, anything that reduces the amount of supply of foreclosure homes on the market is going to be a benefit. And the government is certainly thinking and working in that direction.
Susan Maklari - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then just as a quick follow-up, I think it was Jon that mentioned your ability to maintain your direct cost over the quarter. Given the volatility we've seen in some commodities and the fact that maybe conditions are starting to stabilize a bit, are you starting to see any increased pressure from some of your suppliers to raise prices? And are you having to push back anymore on this? And talk a little bit about maybe how you're offsetting it if you are seeing any of that?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Yes. As I mentioned, there have been impacts from certain materials or commodities. The most recent example of that, I think everyone is aware of, is drywall where there's been increases. We focus on both maintaining our cost on a material, focus item-by-item, but also on the process. And as I said, really managing the opportunities to find at a very detailed level the value and what's happening out in the field, what's happening within our cost codes item-by-item and really driving efficiencies in that regard. So it's a constant battle of managing the fluctuations in the material and commodity market with what we can do operationally to offset that and maintain a low-cost.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen East, Ticonderoga Securities.
Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Stuart, you talked -- or in the press release, you all talked about incentives, and they've stayed sort of flat. If we look at that, what's a normalized level? And if we're starting to see the market recover and order trends pickup, et cetera, do you expect that to start to drop as we move through 2012? Or is that more an entrenched type process that we're going through?
Stuart A. Miller: Well look, incentives are a funny thing. On a more normalized level -- let me go back to really normalized market conditions, you're in the 5% to 10% range. And incentives are in part a composition of sale price. It's kind of a tricky thing to figure out where things actually lie. The fact is that the market is stabilizing, and the first place that we're going to see sales price regenerate itself is with the incentives. And certainly, that is stabilizing and coming down a little bit and contributing to our margins.
Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. Do you expect the incentives to back off as we move through the year?
Stuart A. Miller: Well Stephen, I have a perspective that the market is stabilizing. It's going to take some recovery for the incentives to really back off. On the one hand, I think that I feel cautiously optimistic about what is happening with the market right now and into 2012, but I don't want to get ahead of this market. It's been choppy and rocky. And so I'd say we're going to wait and see. We're going to carefully manage our business and manage the process. I can tell you that Rick and Jon are looking at incentives and sales prices every single day with every division, and that is being managed week-by-week in the field. So to the extent that the market allows it, we're going to be right on it and make sure that incentives are coming down.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. I would add, too, that the foreclosure environment is still out there and we compete against it. And how we position our product with incentives, without incentives, as we compete to show the new home has a value, is going to continue to sort of affect what you see in terms of incentive levels. So Stuart said you've got to be really careful and you analyze it between both sales price and incentives and how you're positioning value.
Bruce E. Gross: Steve, we're managing the business to a net price across the line or below the line. In a more normalized market, it's closing costs. We're not at that juncture right now. But as the market recovers, that's the direction that we're going to take it. It will take us a while to get there.
Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: I got you. So a lot of it's optics to get to that net price. The other thing investors, when they look at this space, they've listened to a lot of the builders talk about all right, we have a tremendous ability to ramp up our operational leverage because we're selling at 2 homes and when we get to 4, we still don't need to add people, et cetera. We're still not seeing it; we haven't really seen it in your numbers this quarter. Is there something going on this quarter on a year-over-year basis that your SG&A really didn't change? And do you expect that to start to change pretty rapidly if you start piling on 20% a quarter-type order rates?
Stuart A. Miller: Well Stephen, it's important to look right now at -- we're at a -- an interesting point, if we look back at the year 2011, we're really flat with 2010. So there's really not any real operational leverage that has been liberated at this point. As I noted in my comments, our posture has been to navigate the toughest part of this market as it looks for a recovery and to remain marginally profitable as we stay patient. And so the operational leverage that we and other builders have talked about has not yet presented itself. The movement from 1 to 1.5 to 2 sales to 4 sales per community per month will present itself and present itself, I think, very decidedly when we start to see real recovery in the marketplace. And we're just not quite there yet. So looking back at 2011, we're kind of flat. As we start to see volumes jump up, those volumes should have an embedded operational leverage in them.
Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division: Okay. If I can sneak in one quick one, on the PPIP, the mark-to-market, are these securities typically held to maturity?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Yes. I mean, that was the plan, Stephen. When we buy them, we really look to what the cash flows look like over the life. And clearly, if there's an opportunity over the life to sell them and to maximize value at some point between now and that maturity, we would do it. But that's really -- when we went into it that was how we looked at it. And by the way, with that said, it's why -- we're not big on recasting our numbers, but we think it's important to look at the Rialto earnings machine without the PPIP either contribution or detraction because it's a clearer picture of what's really happening in Rialto.
Operator: The next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. So you mentioned that the affordability decision has been kind of driving the new home purchases lately. And where have you seen this come through in terms of your product line? And I guess really what we're trying to get at is have you seen the kind of less seasonal first-time buyer come back? And is that what kind of helped you put up a very pretty solid order number this quarter?
Bruce E. Gross: It's really been across the entire universe of the product line. We've seen increased traffic at the entry-level, first-time buyer. We've seen a pick up clearly in that mid-market, and some of our higher-end product has been performing pretty well. Stuart talked a little bit earlier about this value proposition change between the rental world and the for-sale world, and we've seen some evidence that is beyond the surveys. In our traditional marketing approaches, we do eBlaster emails targeted at the rental world with door flyers. And when we do that, we see traffic coming because people are understanding that the overall ownership equation versus the rental equation pencils out. So it's really across the price for a second.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, yes, on some of your kind of interesting marketing initiatives, we noticed on your website that you have a section that is devoted entirely to people who've been through a foreclosure before. I mean, are you seeing a meaningful amount of traffic from this group? And I would assume it's probably a little too early for that group to start buying, but yes, I mean how much of the traffic comes from this area?
Stuart A. Miller: You really have 3 different types of people. You have people who have gone through the short sale process. They are generally taken out of the market for 2 years. You have people that have gone through a foreclosure. They are generally taken out of the market for 3 years. And then you have people who have gone through a bankruptcy, and they're taken out of the market for generally 6 or 7 years. Is it 6 or 7, Jon?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Seven.
Stuart A. Miller: Seven. Okay. So you have a sizable group of people across the country that have gone through a short sale process or foreclosure that are starting to come around the corner and reenter the market. And even if they're not actually in the market or the time hasn't quite lapsed, they are preparing to look at getting back in the market. They are preparing their credit and their down payment because they don't want to be vulnerable to the 12-month repricing that you get in the rental world. And that is what we're seeing out there, and they are active participants.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Just for clarity, this is Jon, that site and our social media effort focuses on renters who also didn't go through that distress but either made the active choice to rent for a period of time or just have credit issues that don't necessarily derive out of the short sale or foreclosure but just have to deal with their particular debt situation, or the situation just needing to save for down payments. So we're trying to communicate and reach out in an effective way to people who are interested in homeownership, and we help and guide them how to get there.
Operator: The next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall of RBC.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Your ASPs are up $5,000 and your incentives are up only $200 year-over-year. This is obviously a very favorable trend, and I just wanted to see if you think this trend is expected to accelerate as you move into the spring selling season.
Bruce E. Gross: As we said, we're really managing towards a net price depending on the product, the division, the market, the community. Each one of these -- each one of our homes are incentivized to sell in order to maximize margin. We gave a little bit of color with regard to what our go-forward margin expectations in there. To some degree, our price expectations on sales prices are reflected in that increased range.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. As Stuart said earlier, I think we're going to have to wait and see what the trend delivers to us and how sales volume materializes. If we do see increased absorptions, we would expect that trend to continue. But if we see a leveling off, then you'd expect flatness. And that really is a result of that level of activity.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Understood. Just turning to your SG&A spending, I think you were at $120 million in 2009 and then subsequently, you've brought that under $100 million in each of the last 2 years. Given your expectations for stronger volumes, are you still going to be able to keep SG&A close to $100 million next year? Or do you expect that's going to go back towards the $120 million number?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Well, it depends on the volume that we're going to see. So you're talking about the SG&A line, it's really dependent on the volume, Bob, that we're going to accomplish and how many new communities that we're going to be opening up.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Got it. And if I could sneak one in, would it be reasonable to look for Rialto to, given the attractive backlog you have, to contribute somewhere north of $50 million next year? Is that a reasonable number to use? Trying to understand how much visibility you guys have into that.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Yes. We haven't given any numbers. You note the last 2 quarters, if you strip out the PPIP, we're around $15 million. But we haven't given any projections because the timing of some of the sales and collections from the borrowers doesn't necessarily come in where you could schedule it perfectly. So we'll have to wait and see. We haven't actually given a number out yet, Bob.
Stuart A. Miller: And with that said, I don't want to diminish the fact that we are seeing -- and I think that we've highlighted for you that we're starting to see real strength in earnings from the Rialto machine. And we look forward to good performance as we go forward.
Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: But at the bare minimum, this -- the trends you're seeing now with Rialto, it looks like it's sustainable into next year.
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: We're enthusiastic about Rialto's prospects as we move ahead.
Operator: The next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim, Credit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just wondering, when you're talking about the market and such, you're talking about a lot of buyers that have worked through foreclosures. How do you -- as you look ahead, how do you think about that in terms of a lot of foreclosures that have yet to come to market and stuck in the process? Do you have any worries about that, especially in Florida where it's been a pretty gradual process there? How are you thinking about?
Stuart A. Miller: Well as I've noted, the foreclosure world, when looked at in a somewhat broader perspective, gets clouded by good markets, the best markets, good markets and not such good markets. And in the markets where we are targeting and where we are making our purchases, and I think Rick did a good job of highlighting our strategy that is decidedly away from areas where there are foreclosures to be had, our markets are generally focused on areas where the foreclosure and even the delinquency backlog had basically been absorbed because they are the more desirable areas to be purchasing. And so even where -- you might think that foreclosures have not yet been completely resolved. In order for a home to get to a foreclosure, it's got to either not be salable at a price that can be realized or properly pay off the mortgage, or at a price where a bank won't accept the short sale. In the more desirable areas, short sales are taking place to -- as an intervention method before you get to a foreclosure. So in those markets, you've seen a lot of clearing, and we think the overhang is not nearly as severe.  Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody's attention on our 2011 review. We look forward to giving you more color as we go forward into 2012. Thanks for your attention.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Okay, good morning, and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter 2011 update. As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment, is here to participate as well. Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer; and Rick Beckwitt, our President, are available to participate by phone for the question-and-answer period, they don't happen to be here in Miami today. I'm going to begin with some brief remarks about the current housing market in general. Jeff will update Rialto's progress, and Bruce will provide detail on our numbers. And then of course, we'll open the phone line to your question. As always, I'd like to request that in our Q&A period, everyone please limit to just one question and one follow-up, so that we can be as fair as possible to everybody. In the context of what continues to be a challenging U.S. housing market, we're pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability as we continue to position Lennar for future success. As noted in our press release, all of our business segments, Homebuilding, Financial Services and Rialto, were profitable in the quarter in spite of significant challenges. Bruce will review the numbers in a few minutes. Throughout our third quarter, we continued to see evidence that the consumer is beginning to return in earnest to the homebuilding market. Although sales price and pace are still under pressure, traffic trends have continued to improve and real, traditional primary purchasers with a real desire to purchase are showing up. The combination of home prices that have dropped to attractive levels across the country, together with interest rates on 30-year loans that are at historic lows, has made the prospect of home ownership both compelling and widely affordable. In addition, increases in rental rates that consumers are feeling and seeing in many markets are driving people to consider the stability of home ownership as it relates to housing costs over years. Finally, the millions of Americans that have either moved home, found a roommate or otherwise postponed forming a new household are beginning to consider their living accommodations, and options abound today and they are affordable. Demand remains constrained, however, by the availability of financing and general consumer confidence. Mortgage financing is still only available to the most creditworthy purchasers and an already skittish customer is being driven away from the purchase by a burdensome and invasive mortgage qualification process together with a mountain of paperwork and never-ending re-verifications. There has been a clear overcorrection that has taken place in the lending market as the ability for buyers to actually get loans is limited at best. The government remains the primary financing resource in the housing market. FHA, VA, Fannie and Freddie are the primary drivers of the housing finance market, but are constrained by government oversight and mandate that is risk adverse and primarily focused on the preservation of existing capital. Additionally, there is a prevailing desire in Washington to have the government exit the mortgage finance business. This combination of drivers is shrinking available capital needed for demand to turn into actual sales. We reviewed our last 18 months of FHA, VA and Fannie and Freddie loans, and found that the average FICO score was in the 700 range, while the average rejection was in the 650 range. Today's rigid risk matrix is severely limiting access to the market for the many customers who have a down payment, have a job, have acceptable credit and are good credit risks in a normalized environment. And while there is, of course, virtue in being risk adverse, the logical extension of where we are is that we make only one loan for $200,000 to Warren Buffett and we will never have a default. Unfortunately, we will also not have much of a housing market. Loan limits for government agencies are set to be reduced on October 1 of this year and other actions continue to hamper the expansion of credit availability. Traditional lenders are constrained by the threat of putbacks in an uncertain regulatory environment. A private securities market has not reemerged to provide needed capital for finance and likely won't become a factor until the playing field of risk identification and the legal consequence of a loan and mortgage are resolved. Initial Private Label securities are populated with loans that are of exceedingly high credit standards. Today's ultraconservative home finance environment has been a limiting factor in the normalization of demand and confidence for both new and existing homes. Free market forces are beginning to work the way they're supposed to, but they are constrained. Fortunately, there is a growing awareness in the government today that the economy and jobs are not likely to recover without a recovery in housing. I've spent a considerable amount of time recently with members of the government and am seeing a change in attitude and focus. As home prices have continued to slide and foreclosures have risen, there's a growing awareness that restricting credit at this time is not prudent. Policies to date have not worked, and we're starting to see the government reach out to a broad spectrum of industry thinkers for ideas and information on how to stabilize and stimulate housing. It seems that this is part of a process. It is slow and frustrating for sure, but trial and error will ultimately give way to the right answers. I believe that the lending log jam will ultimately be unlocked. And as lenders begin to lend again to appropriate underwriting standards, and they will, demand will be unlocked and in turn, increased sales, together with positive press, will create much-needed urgency and unlock consumer confidence in the housing sector. While the market seeks equilibrium, at Lennar, we remained focused on maintaining profitability at current levels of operation. We have sharpened our focus on our core Homebuilding business given the current economic conditions while we position for an ultimate recovery. We've just completed our third quarter operations reviews with our regional presidents. Rick and Jon have gone through the operations and business plans of each of our divisions and reviewed the performance and position of each division and their respective markets. We remain optimistic about the future of the housing market in general and about our business in particular. In almost all of our divisions, we're continuing to find that there are pockets of activity that are strong, and we've continued to make strategic purchases of new land and communities in areas that continue to produce strong margins for our homebuilding operations. These purchases are holding us in good stead today and are preparing us for even better performance as market conditions improve. In order to drive profitability in current market conditions, we've gotten each of the most important components of our operating business working well and efficiently. Our product research and reworked product offerings are enabling us to compete favorably with the existing home market and foreclosures as they are our biggest competitors in today's market. Our efficient cycle time enables us to be less reliant on standing inventories for sale and our careful negotiation of construction costs is helping us drive value-oriented sales prices which are required for sales in these market conditions. Our low inventory approach to sales and starts is working to help maintain our industry-leading margins and our carefully managed overhead levels are in line with our current volume and are working to drive a positive net margin. Our Lennar's Everything's Included marketing platform is highlighting our value-oriented offerings to our customers, and our strategic land purchasers, driven in large part by leveraging our Rialto relationships, are working to position us with low-cost lands to drive higher margins. And of course, most importantly, our extremely strong management team and associates that have driven this company through the best and the worst of times continue to be the driving force that keeps our company ahead of the market and positioned for success. Alongside Homebuilding, Lennar's Financial Services segment continued to improve its operational performance as well. Just as our Homebuilding operations have right-sized to current volume, our Financial Services group has worked hard to trim overhead in order to contribute profitably at today's volumes. Similarly, an increase in volume in the Homebuilding segment will translate into strong operational leverage for our Financial Services segment as well. And Bruce will give you some additional detail on the Financial Services segment. Our Rialto program continues to complement our Homebuilding and Financial Services activity as it also adds to our overall profitability. Except for the mark-to-market adjustment reported in the PPIP program this quarter, Rialto continues to show very strong operational performance and profitability as we continue to build that program. In the third quarter, we continued to add to our investment pool by purchasing approximately $380 million of assets or approximately $170 million of equity primarily through our Rialto opportunity fund. Additionally, we've expanded the size of that fund from approximately $370 million last quarter -- reported last quarter to almost $600 million including at closing last week. This affords us a great deal of capital to pursue the many opportunities that exists in today's distressed markets. Rialto has continued to grow, and Jeff will update you on that progress in a minute. All in all, we're very comfortable with our current position, the current position of Lennar today. We know that market conditions remain difficult and we do not believe that there's a silver bullet, quick fix out there. Accordingly, we’ve positioned ourselves to remain profitable while the market corrects and positioned to benefit from strong operational leverage when the market starts to improve. Our willingness to confront the reality of market conditions honestly and early has enabled our company to make the necessary adjustments to get to profitability in the short term while we strategically position our company for future success. Jeff?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Thanks, Stuart, and good morning, everyone. Before Bruce reviews the details behind Rialto's $5.7 million of operating earnings, along with the results of the rest of the company, there are a few areas that might be helpful to touch on to give a little bit more perspective on Rialto. The economic turmoil and wild market swings in recent months have not altered Rialto's investment thesis, and if anything, has strengthened our belief that banks and other financial solutions must push to clear hundreds of billions of dollars of distressed real estate assets from their books in order for the system to return to financial health. Therefore, we believe that the opportunity to purchase distressed assets is as strong, if not stronger than ever. And we remain focused on evaluating, and if we can continue to price advantageously, acquiring distressed portfolios and other real estate assets through our Rialto real estate fund. Market volatility has also been responsible for preventing us from having our most profitable quarter yet as a result of the $10.1 million unrealized loss related to our share of the mark-to-market on the mortgage-backed securities in our PPIP fund. However, those marks, as required by U.S. Treasury, reflect more of the general sentiment in the marketplace related to fixed income assets. We've not changed our view of the resilient underlying cash flows that we use to underwrite and price our PPIP investments. In fact, to date, we've recognized approximately $20 million in interest income and fees related to our $68 million investment in and management of that fund. As Stuart mentioned, we've expanded the amount of outside capital to work side-by-side with our $75 million now that we have a total of approximately $600 million of equity committed to our Rialto real estate fund. Based on our current and anticipated investments, we believe the fund will not only help to enhance the company's returns and give us access to transactions that we might not otherwise be able to invest in, but also will be an important building block for us to develop a first-class investment management business. The fund has now been able to acquire or tie up a total of 17 different negotiated transactions, exclusive of those we're in a process of adding to the fourth quarter pipeline. We've invested over $300 million of fund equity to date to acquire almost $1 billion of unpaid principal balance for about $0.37 on the dollar. On the operations side, we continue to build an outstanding team of professionals, which has now grown to approximately 175 associates across the country involved in transaction sourcing and due diligence, loan workout, property management, development and sales, investment management and finance accounting and administration. We've been hard at work adding value to assets since we closed our first 2 structure transactions with the FDIC in April of – well, we started in April of last year. In those 2 transactions alone, we've now collected almost $350 million of cash and have been up to the fees [ph] almost 1/3 of the outstanding $627 million of FDIC seller financing. And while it's still early in the life cycle of these 2 portfolios, resolutions to date have averaged approximately $0.80 on the dollar. Our managers have been working out loans and dealing with a variety of underlying collateral, including residential communities and land, shopping centers, office buildings, hotels and industrial buildings in micromarkets across the country, and with many borrowers that we've dealt with before. As a result, we have up-to-date proprietary information about how assets are currently being resolved, which is extremely helpful when pricing new transactions. And because of the high percentage of loans made to developers being able to efficiently incorporate the Lennar homebuilding team's unique view and expertise gives us another distinct advantage in our evaluation and maximization of value for these assets. And as part of this active collaboration, the Homebuilding divisions continue to capture distressed opportunities from the same institutions we've been working with on the portfolios, providing a great mechanism to generate new communities at extremely attractive pricing. In addition, when we do purchase assets at our pricing, we're positioned to very quickly and efficiently bring those assets right into our already in-place workout machine. So all in all, we remain very excited about the Rialto franchise, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team. And we look forward to reporting to you our progress in future quarters. Thank you.
B. E. Gross: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. This is Bruce. I will review the results in all 3 segments, starting with our Homebuilding segment. Revenues from home sales were $700 million, which is consistent with the prior year's quarter. Home deliveries, excluding joint ventures, decreased 3%, offset by a 3% increase in average sales price to $247,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: The East region was $233,000, up 9%; Central, $223,000, up 2%; Houston, $229,000, up 3%; West, $303,000, down 2%; and the Other region, $268,000, down 2%. Our gross margins on home sales was 21.1% in the third quarter, which is consistent with the prior year's gross margin percentage. However, it improved 170 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of 2011. This margin improvement is largely attributable to the successful results from investments and communities purchased since 2009. These communities have outperformed the company average gross margin percentage by over 200 basis points. Additionally, as Stuart mentioned, our efficient Everything's Included program and continued product reengineering also contributed to the strong gross margins. The gross margins were strongest in the East and West regions this quarter. Sales incentives increased by $3,000 from the prior year's quarter to $33,600, however, decreased approximately $300 sequentially from the second quarter. Gross margins were benefited by 120 basis points relating to changes in cost to complete estimates for closeout communities, which was offset by valuation adjustments that impacted the gross margin percentage by about 130 basis points. The benefit from the cost to complete in these closeout communities were primarily related to reimbursables received from development districts. Our SG&A percentage increased 40 basis points from the prior year, however, improved 60 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of this year. As a result of the strong gross margin percentages and improvements in SG&A, our Homebuilding operating margins improved 240 basis points sequentially from the second quarter to 6.8%. We purchased approximately 3,200 well-located home sites in the third quarter, totaling approximately $182 million. Additionally, we purchased $66 million of banknotes that are secured by real estate in A+ locations. Although we continue to invest in new communities and we opened 29 new well-positioned communities this quarter, we had approximately 50 communities closing out. As a result, our active community count, which moves around from quarter-to-quarter, was reduced to 428 communities at quarter-end. In addition to new orders reaching the highest level in 5 years other than the tax credit period in early 2010, our homes in backlog at the end of the quarter increased to the highest level in 3 years. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 20%, which is still at the low end of our -- what we would call our normal range. Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $8 million versus $6.8 million in the prior year. Mortgage pretax income was $7.4 million versus $7.0 million in the prior year. During the quarter, we successfully entered into a global settlement with one of the 3 large banks that purchased the vast majority of our mortgage originations. This settlement was within the accrued liability on our books for potential mortgage put-back exposure and covers all potential claims on loans originated before 2009. We are comfortable that the remaining mortgage put-back liability on our books is adequate. Our title company generated $1.3 million of profit versus approximately breakeven in the prior year. They returned to profitability by implementing additional cost savings initiatives throughout the quarter. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings totaling $5.7 million, and this number is net of $6.1 million of net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest. The composition of Rialto's $5.7 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: $5.3 million of contribution came from our 40% share of the FDIC portfolios; $11.8 million from non-FDIC portfolios; as Jeff mentioned, we had a loss in PPIP, it totaled $7.6 million; and $1.4 million as a new contribution from the Rialto real estate fund. These numbers are less approximately $5.2 million of G&A and other expenses, which are net of management fees and reimbursements of $5.3 million. The contribution from the FDIC portfolios of $5.3 million and the $11.8 million of contribution from the non-FDIC portfolios this quarter are primarily from accretable interest income, collections from guarantors, sale of REO and gains upon foreclosures of REO, all net of REO expenses. The PPIP loss for the quarter is comprised of $10.1 million of unrealized loss due to mark-to-market adjustments from the widening spreads discussed by Jeff, partially offset by $2.5 million of interest income. Our 15% interest in the Rialto real estate fund generated approximately $1.4 million of profits, which is in addition to management fees highlighted above. At quarter-end, there was already $190 million in the defeasance cash account to retire debt in the FDIC portfolio. Additionally, there was $70 million of cash on Rialto's balance sheet. The success of the Rialto real estate fund has enabled us to grow Rialto using third-party capital. During the quarter, the company didn't invest any new capital in the Rialto segment, except for $35 million representing our share of the Rialto fund commitments. In the third quarter, we continued to maintain a strong liquid balance sheet. Our leverage remained low as our Homebuilding debt to total capital net of the $800 million of cash was 46.6% at the end of Q3. Inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned stayed flat at $3.9 billion. Shareholders’ equity increased to $2.7 billion, with the book value per share amounting to $14.28. This book value per share does not include our fully reserved Deferred Tax Asset, which is currently at $593 million, or $3.17 per outstanding share. In conclusion, we are pleased with our continued reporting of quarterly profits. And given current market conditions, we remain confident that we will remain profitable in our fourth quarter and for all of 2011. With that, we will open it up for questions.
Operator: Our first question is coming from Alan Ratner of Zelman Associates.
Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates, Research Division: Stuart, I was hoping to just expand on your comments which were pretty encouraging about the traffic that you've been seeing improving lately. And that certainly seems counter to what we're hearing from a lot of the other macro data points, whether it's consumer confidence fading or the stock market continuing to languish here. So was curious if that's something that has continued through August, which is kind of a meat of the, I guess, the economic turmoil we've seen, and into September? Or if that was kind of more in the first part of the quarter? And maybe you did see some impact from what we're seeing in the stock market recently?
Stuart Miller: Well, listen, let me say generally, the answer is we're still seeing building strength in terms of people coming in, looking and having an in-earnest desire to be a purchaser. But given the economic turmoil, it's certainly kind of a rocky ground right now. But I think that the trend is generally in the upward direction. I think that market forces are working the way they're supposed to, in that these low prices and low interest rates are really piquing peoples' interest and getting them to think about the long-term cost of their living conditions. Rental rates going up is getting people thinking about the value of the 30-year fixed rate mortgage, particularly at today's interest rates. And we're clearly seeing people come in that are rethinking the home purchase opportunity. Let me just have Rick or Jon weight in on that. I apologize, we're not in the same room, so either one.
Richard Beckwitt: A little bit -- this is Rick. As we got to the August, the month of August in the quarter, we saw a little bit of a slowdown on a year-over-year basis because of the volatility in the markets. But that's just in conversion. But traffic has been strong and continues to be pretty upbeat.
Stuart Miller: Go ahead, Jon.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: As you see rental rates push up, which we've seen in all the markets that we're in, we're definitely seeing more of our consumer come out and realize the value of today's product offering. And I think that's what Stuart was speaking to in terms of those positive trends, and that's against the forces of both the economic news and the credit environment we're in, we are seeing a pique in interest.
Alan Ratner: Great. And Bruce, just a follow-up on the disclosure you gave about the settlement on the putbacks, what was the cash impact on that from the quarter, or is that something that you're going to be paying out in the fourth quarter? And is there anything in the works for, I guess, the other 2 large banks that bought the bulk of your mortgages?
B. E. Gross: So you will see, when we file our Q, you'll see that our liability has come down from about $9.9 million to about $6.8 million or so, so just over $3 million for one of those 3 majors. And we're talking to the others as well. And we'll keep you posted on that. But that cash did go out during the third quarter.
Alan Ratner: Was this one, just directionally, was this the largest of the 3, the smallest of the 3?
B. E. Gross: Well, let's put it -- we have a confidentiality settlement agreement. So let's leave it at, it's one of the 3 majors that were out there. But again, we've really vetted our reserve that we have out there. We think that we reserved adequately and whether we settle on a global basis or not, we're still very comfortable with the remaining just under $7 million that we had reserved for these putbacks.
Stuart Miller: And just to your question, we are having active discussions with the others. And we feel pretty good that we'll be able to resolve this comfortably.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Barclays Capital.
Stephen Kim - Citigroup: So congratulations on the homebuilding side; I’d love to ask you some questions there. But let me start with, if I can, with Rialto. It looks to us like in the Rialto segment, the -- your REO gains were probably running about half of where they were the last couple of quarters, I just want to confirm that that's true. And if so, what is the primary driver for that?
B. E. Gross: Yes, the Rialto gains were driven primarily by the category of -- in REO, there's gains upon foreclosures, Steve, there's collections from some of the borrowers. There's some sale of REO. And those are net of REO expenses.
Stuart Miller: Right. Yes, and some of those expenses, as we've taken more real estate in, some of the expenses have continued to ramp up as you bring some of those assets on board and bring the assets up to snuff or you pay the property taxes or whatever the case might be. And it's also a mix, too, of which assets might have come in that month.
Stephen Kim - Citigroup: Okay. So did you have a -- I know you guys don't account for or you don't assume you're going to get any collections from the borrowers. But last quarter, I think you did. Did you guys have any of that kind of benefit in the quarter?
Stuart Miller: Yes, yes, we did. Yes, we are continuing to collect from the borrowers even after the real estate has been taken in.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Dan Ippenheimer (sic) [Dan Oppenheim] of Credit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Stuart, early on you were talking about the tough mortgage environment with a greater understanding and number the government in terms of just challenges. Are you expecting any real changes from government potentially easing of mortgage terms? I guess, we wouldn't -- aren't -- weren't expecting so much along those lines, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts there.
Stuart Miller: I will tell you, Dan, it's hard to handicap. All I can tell you is that the discussions that are taking place are with piqued interest. There's a lot of attention being paid to housing thinkers and leaders. There's a lot of receptivity to some rethinking of government’s pullback from FHA, VA, Fannie and Freddie. Even with the pending reduction in loan limits, there are active discussions right now as to whether or not October 1 should come and go and see those loan limits reduced. And I can't handicap whether something will change before then or not. But it is interesting to watch the dialogue. People are getting concerned, particularly within the election cycle, that a continued slide in home prices and increase in foreclosure as we've been seeing will reflect badly, frankly, on both parties. And I think that there is an appetite to find a way to stabilize. There are some that believe that the private sector is the only answer and the right answer. But that is a growing minority, meaning it used to be the majority of people felt that way. I don't know how to handicap it, but my sense is that the government is going to find a way to loosen some of the lending standards that have gotten so oppressively difficult. And I think that the first answer in credit is going to come from the government. And then ultimately, we'll see some regulatory certainty creep in to enable a private solution to take shape. But I do feel that the government is going to come around to finding a way to get the lending markets working again.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: First question, it was helpful to discuss the community count during the quarter, and I was wondering if you could just remind us what that impact was in terms of average community count open on a year-over-year basis for 3Q '11 over 3Q '10? And going forward over the next few quarters, do you expect community count to resume its increase?
Jeffrey P. Krasnoff: Let me answer, Mike, your first question. I don't have an average, but again, let me remind everybody, the way we define active community count is 5 or more remaining to sell in a community. We started the quarter with 449, we ended with 428. In the prior year, we ended with approximately 448 and we started with a lower number. I don't have an exact average for you, however. As in the past, we didn't report community count for a while because it's always a little confusing. You have some communities finishing up at a moment in time and some starting. We do expect, because we're investing in communities that we're excited about, that the overall community count will increase. But we can never anticipate exactly how many fall off in any quarter, that's why we don't give a projection as you look forward. Hopefully that's helpful.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: No, that is helpful. The second question, just looking at the gross margins, it was helpful to explain the cost to complete benefit. Just wanted to clarify and make sure that, that's more of a -- what you'd consider a one-time benefit. And also kind of looking forward, the -- do you expect a higher contribution from the newer communities that you've purchased, or do you see the 19% to 21% range, or 20% to 21% range that you've exhibited in the last several quarters to continue?
B. E. Gross: Sure. The range that we've put out there previously, 19% to 21%, when you strip out the -- and I would call it a nonrecurring benefit of 120 basis points relating to those closeout communities. We ended up at the high end of the range. But I think it's fair to say that 19% to 21% is still the range that we look towards, same as we said last quarter. As far as the percentage of new communities that are contributing to our deliveries, it's in the high 30s, it's about 39% of our deliveries are coming from the new communities. We expect that, that percentage continuing to gradually increase each quarter, so expect that number to continue to grow. And we're seeing about 200-plus basis points gross margin above the company average from those newer communities.
Stuart Miller: Let me just invite Rick or Jon to weigh in on community count and margin from new communities.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, this is Rick. As Bruce said, we're getting tremendously strong margins in the new areas. A lot of these communities were -- have been around for a while and new communities could be something that's been open for, let's say, 18 months. Depending on the size of the community, that community could have been closed out because some of these deals came in through the TOUSA deal. But generally speaking, the underwriting standards that we've had for the new communities are in the 20%-plus gross margin area; high, high IRRs, and they perform extremely well. As the markets have stabilized, it's allowed us to bring into production some of the older assets, and those are starting to get some traction as well.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: First question, Stuart, you made a comment in the opening remarks, and if I heard it correctly, it was that the average FICO score of your FHA-approved loans was in the 700s and there were a number of rejections, I think you maybe said the average rejection was at a 640 or 650 FICO. And I'm wondering if we should take from that, that banks are tightening – FHA-approved lenders are tightening standards further from kind of the 640 to 650 range, or maybe there was something else that was going on in those loan applications that caused them to get rejected? I'm just trying to get more color on that.
Stuart Miller: Yes. That's a good question, David. Anytime you look at a group of loans, there are so many different elements that define the approvability of a loan, and isolating just the FICO store doesn't tell the whole story. But generally speaking, the answer is that there has been a tightening. It has been gradual and it has been continuing. And it's coming, frankly, both from FHA, VA and being distinct from Fannie and Freddie, and from the FHFA regulator, who oversees Fannie and Freddie as well. And then the banks have overlaid their own credit tightening. So the answer is there has been a tendency to continue to tighten and the rejection, which we've seen at about 20% of people who have a deposit, are ready and willing, have a good FICO score in the 650 range, just is really evidence that the market is really tough, that the lending standards have really constrained demand and maybe gone too far.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got it. Maybe we could stay on the mortgage market for a follow-up, and thank you for that color, it's very helpful. Stuart, you're talking about private lenders and the private lender market eventually reemerging. And I'm trying to get an idea, do you think this is more a question of lenders, private lenders working through the REO they already own? Or is this more of an indemnification from putbacks, is it Dodd-Frank, kind of QRM, QM? What you think is kind of the linchpin for getting more private lender activity back into the market?
Stuart Miller: Well, I think that as it relates to the legacy assets, most of the private lenders have marked their assets and -- at least on the residential side. And that's less of a contributing factor. I think that the dominant factors are the putback risk of the lawsuits, the risk retention rules and the Dodd-Frank rules that are not yet clarified. The lenders are dealing with a complicated landscape that is also in part defined by the FDIC regulator coming in and looking at their book of business, and being either critical of what falls in or what falls out to their capital requirements. So it's a whole -- it's a group of tentacles of problems that are kind of dragging the traditional lenders away from any kind of aggressive role in the lending environment. And I know that there’s a general sense that, hey, it's good not be an aggressive lender, it's good to be risk adverse and stuff like that. But the question is, are we going to have a lending market where people can get loans for homes, or are we going to pullback so dramatically that we limit demand and the market can't correct itself? There's a balance there. And the private market isn't ready to make that first step. It's probably going to have to come from the government.
Operator: The next question is coming from Mr. Josh Levin of Citigroup.
Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Stuart, the Obama administration is mulling over an idea to have the GSEs partner with the private sector and perhaps rent out the GSE’s inventory of foreclosed homes. Given how opportunistic you and Rialto have been, is this an avenue that Rialto might go down?
Stuart Miller: Well, we -- it's a possible avenue. We've talked about it, and we've articulated some positions with people in the government who are thinking about this avenue. It's, again, something that as more color and definition comes out as to what the opportunity looks like, we will certainly be considering whether we deploy Rialto assets in that direction. In terms of whether it's a good idea or a bad idea for the economy, we're a supporter of this and many other initiatives that are focused on bringing supply and demand in balance. So with the legacy portfolios of Fannie, Freddie, FHA, VA and the backlog of homes that they own, it certainly is a good way to drive some income to the government. So we'll just have to see what happens and see how we can participate.
Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. On a separate note, Bruce, it looks like you burned about $145 million of cash during the quarter. I mean, burn is a wrong word, but what was the reason and what was the real use of cash during the quarter?
B. E. Gross: Yes. So almost all of that, Josh, was related to 2 things: acquisitions of new communities, again, these are well-located communities that we're excited about; and then other half is the purchase of some of the banknotes that I mentioned a little earlier that again are secured by what we would call A+ locations. So we think it's appropriate as we're very efficient with managing our cash. Yet Rialto that's recycling cash, most of their investments are coming from third-party capital. This quarter, the only investment we made in Rialto was related to our contribution to the fund. On the Homebuilding side, our cycle time is efficient. Our Everything's Included program, we're recycling capital there as well. So really, the change in cash is really focused on new opportunities that we're excited about.
Stuart Miller: Yes, and let me just say, Josh, I'm happy that you corrected that vocabulary misstep. This is anything but burning cash. We're really pretty enthusiastic about the deployment of capital to grow the future of our business. We think that we're investing our capital right now in primarily the Homebuilding business. Rialto is self-sustaining at this point. And we think that the opportunities that we're investing in are -- we know that they're contributing to current profitability, but we're perhaps most enthusiastic about what these investments mean for the future. And we've been very creative in the way that we both access and the way we've structured these investments. We think they're going to hold us in good stead in the years to come.
Operator: The next question is coming from Steve Stelmach of FBR.
Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: You mentioned strategic land acquisitions and sort of dovetails with the prior questions, to what extent are land purchases today influenced by loan level pricing adjustments by the GSEs? Or do you simply look beyond that for a day where financing overall just gets better? In other words, are you avoiding some markets that are subject to loan level pricing adjustments where the borrower simply just can't get the financing?
Richard Beckwitt: This is Rick. I don't think we're avoiding markets. We may be steering away from various price points because of the difficulty of the borrower to get financed at certain levels.
Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay, but it’s not dissuading you from any particular markets, okay. And then secondly, on Rialto, I believe you mentioned selling some assets at FDIC, assets at $0.80 on the dollar. To what extent is that low-hanging fruit? In other words, the resolutions reflect the things that are relatively easy to sell versus maybe just mix shift and perhaps timing?
Stuart Miller: Yes. Again, that's over the first 18 months. But to a large degree, it's very early in the cycle. So yes, we do have a lot more assets to work through. But we're feeling very good early on in terms of where we are with the portfolio. And additionally, I'd say that there's very little in the way of low hanging fruit in these portfolios. It's distress is distressed because it is distressed. And I think that across the board, you're going to see a pretty steady resolution pattern. Some of the first resolutions have been some of the most difficult. So I think you can expect to see some consistency.
Steve Stelmach - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Okay. So as shouldn't see some significant changes in the economics going forward? You feel pretty good about the value that you’ll monetize going forward?
Stuart Miller: Yes, I think that as with anything in today's world, there can be some choppiness. But by and large, our program of resolution is a program of process. And it's a process that is carefully laid out. It takes time, but ultimately leads in a carefully constructed direction. I think that process will work on -- across the portfolio.
Operator: The next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I just wanted to follow up on the cash flow, the cash position. Clearly, you folks have a lot of investment opportunities ahead, as the housing market continues to recover and obviously on the Rialto side as well. So given the significant increase in stress in the credit markets, I just wanted to get a sense of your thinking on your cash position and how low would you be willing to run your cash balance and financing strategies for that growth?
B. E. Gross: As we were saying a minute ago, Nishu, we think given our efficiency that it's appropriate to invest some of that capital in some of these great opportunities that we're seeing. So we think there's a range of probably $300 million to $500 million of cash that we'd want to keep on the balance sheet in any one quarter, and of course, that's dependent on things like maturing debt and the like. But we've done a nice job of pushing out debt maturities and we'll continue to do that. So with that assumption, we think somewhere in the $300 million to $500 million range is probably about the right level.
Stuart Miller: Yes, let me just add to that. Look, I think Diane does an incredible job of keeping us focused 3, 4, 5 quarters ahead of where we are. Our cash management program is really carefully orchestrated. And we're constantly looking at how we're operating our businesses in terms of cash coming in, cash going out. As we've noted, Rialto, which has been a question mark for a lot of people to how many dollars we'd invest and everything. It's really become self-sustaining, the Rialto operating or opportunity fund has really become the primary investment reservoir for Rialto. And that affords us a great opportunity to be a participant in the market, but still holding our cash position steady for the overall company. On the Homebuilding side, given our cycle time and our focus on operational excellence, we're really bringing in a lot of cash from the sale of homes from the underlying land relative to those sales and profitability and redeploying that capital. And while we are deploying excess capital into the Homebuilding side, it's on a very carefully constructed basis.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. That’s very helpful. And second question I wanted to ask was, you -- and a couple people have asked about, you mentioned the slow return of some normality and some improvement in demand. So just wondering, the 11% order, year-over-year order comp, especially against the very, very weak period post the tax credit last year, doesn’t seem as strong as it might have been. Now of course, I have to contrast that with your gross margin, which was very strong. So maybe this quarter, you chose to harvest more of the demand on the margin side, holding tight on pricing. I was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that and on the trade-off and what you're seeing out there and how you’re managing it?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, this is Rick. We're constantly adjusting the pace of sales with the ability to increase pricing in the communities that we're selling homes in. On a longer-term basis, we get more upside by pushing pricing up and pushing volume, because it allows us to increase margins and does wonderful things for some of our older communities, with regard to increasing appraisals. Each one of the communities has their own business model. And as such, we may be doing one thing in one community on a volume basis and another thing in another community based on sales price.
Jonathan M. Jaffe: This is Jon. I would add to that, that across the country-wide it varies from market to market slightly. Most markets are performing at about 1/2 a sale a week per community. And I think the reality is there's not a lot the homebuilding industry can do to change that level of absorption. So we stay very focused on maintaining the margin and maintaining that level of absorption, which is consistent with what's going on in the overall environment. And that keeps us really focused on that efficiency that you've heard us talk about on managing our costs and our cycle time so that we can really cycle the cash, keep margins up, but be realistic about where absorptions are occurring in the current economic environment.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: A question on Rialto, can you give any color on how the PPIP mark-to-market loss was distributed through the quarter? Since this quarter does include the month of June where we saw a lot of volatility in MBS prices, was the bulk of the decline in that month? And how have things fared in July, August and also since the calendar quarter end?
B. E. Gross: Well, in terms of which months in the quarter, basically, June and August were the 2 large down months. Actually, August was down more than June was. The month of July was relatively flat. In terms of comments about this quarter, I think it's a little bit too early at this stage of the game to kind of give you any kind of guidance as to where we are in terms of marks this quarter so far.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: And would you mind giving some measure of the magnitude of performance decline you saw in June and August? The percentage price decline in CMBS or non-agency RMBS?
B. E. Gross: Actually, I don't have that percentage handy. I think August was down somewhere in the 5% to 5.5% range, something like that.
Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And your comments indicated that the mark was based on more like general industry trends rather than underlying cash flow performance on the securities. So are these securities marked merely based on indices, and is that really what drove the mark-to-market?
B. E. Gross: Yes, it's more based on indices than anything else, because there really have been very -- relatively few trades, particularly of the securities that we own under PPIP. So it's really been more based upon how the rest of the RMBS and CMBS market have traded and how fixed income in general has traded and not so much a lot of data points on specific bonds.
Stuart Miller: And our cash flows have remained consistent.
B. E. Gross: Right, and cash flows have remained consistent in terms of how we underwrote versus what we're looking at today.
Operator: The last question is coming from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk about the new communities a little bit more. You said that on average, about 200 basis points outperformance in the gross margin side. I was wondering if you’ve seen a difference between timing, say, the communities you opened -- you've acquired during the last 2 years, and I'm asking that from the perspective as it seems that some builders got too aggressive in bidding for land in the beginning of last year and some of those communities are underperforming. So I was wondering if there was any kind of trend almost by vintage within the last 2 years of performance?
Stuart Miller: Rick?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes. If you look at it, we're not seeing any kind of dramatic change. All of these things were underwritten. If you look at the volume of activity that we did over the last 12, 18, 24 months, I think you'll see if you look at the cash flow going out and land acquisitions that we sort of stepped away from the markets when it got a little frothy and then moved back in when they cooled back down and took advantage of people stepping away because of their aggressive tactics during those time periods. But across the board, regardless of the vintage 24 months ago, 18 months, last 3 months, that 200 basis point spread is pretty standard.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then 2 other kind of housekeeping questions, can you give me your owned and optioned lot count? And then just backing into the impairments, based upon your commentary for gross margins suggests about a $9 million impairment this quarter, I wanted to make sure that was right.
B. E. Gross: Sure. Starting with the home sites owned and controlled, there were about 107,000 owned and controlled, of which 91,000 were owned. And the impairments from a homebuilding perspective, homebuilding communities was about $9.7 million.
Stuart Miller: Okay, that wraps it up for us. Want to thank everybody for joining us. Just in summary, we're really very comfortable with the positioning of all 3 of our segments right now. Current profitability, operating leverage as the market starts to come back a little bit. And when that'll be, that's up for grabs. So thank you for joining us, and we look forward to reporting next quarter.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your speaker for today's call, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Mr. Miller, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2011 update.  As always, I'm joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, who just read the statement, our Controller. Additionally, Rick Beckwitt, our President; Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment are here to participate as well. I'm going to begin with some brief opening remarks about the current housing market in general. Jon and Rick will discuss our homebuilding operations. Jeff will update on Rialto's progress and Bruce will provide details on our numbers. Then of course, we'll open our phone lines to questions. As always, I'd like to request that in our Q&A period, everybody, please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to everyone. In the context of what continues to be a very challenging U.S. housing market, we are pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of profitability as we continue to position our company for future success. While it's now well-documented that the expected spring selling season of 2011 simply did not materialize, it is beginning to feel like the worst days of the housing market are getting behind us. Although sales, pace and price are still under pressure, traffic trends have continued to improve and real, traditional, primary purchasers, with the real desire to purchase, are showing up, recognizing the prices are low, recognizing that interest rates are low and that this is an excellent time to purchase a home. Make no mistake, stabilization and recovery will continue to be a slow and rocky process as traffic and desire have not yet translated into strong actual sales. These are, though, the first signs that repair of the market is upon us. Sales remain constrained by available financing and confidence. Today's ultraconservative home finance environment has been a limiting factor in the normalization of demand and confidence for both new and existing homes. But as lenders begin to lend again to appropriate underwriting standards, and they will, demand will be unlocked and in turn, increased sales and improved year-over-year comparisons together with positive press will create much-needed urgency and unlock consumer confidence in the housing sector. At Lennar, we've just completed our second quarter operations reviews with all of our Division Presidents. We've gone through the operations and business plans of each of our divisions and reviewed the performance and position of each division and their respective market. I find myself somewhat optimistic about the future of the housing market in general and for our business, in particular. In almost all of our divisions, we are finding that there are pockets of activity that are actually strong and across our markets, primary buyers are venturing out from a long, cold winter to consider purchasing. While the overall landscape remained somewhat troubling from a short-term macroeconomic perspective, at Lennar, we've remained profitable in the short-term. We have sharpened our focus on our core Homebuilding business, given the current economic conditions while we position for an ultimate recovery. Driving profitability, we have gotten a lot of components of our business working. Our product research and reworked product offerings are working to compete favorably with the existing home market and foreclosures. Our dramatically reduced cycle time is working to enable less reliance on standing inventories for sale. Our intense focus on driving construction cost lower is working to enable value-oriented sales prices. Our low inventory approach to sales and start is working to help maintain our industry-leading margins. Our carefully managed overhead levels are working to drive comfortable net margin even at reduced volumes. Our Everything's Included marketing platform is working to highlight our value-oriented offerings to our customers. Our strategic land purchases leveraging our Rialto relationships are working to position us with low-cost land to drive higher margins. And most importantly, our extremely strong management team that has driven this company through the best and worst of times, is working day and night to stay a step ahead of market movements. We confirmed in our operations reviews that the controls and strategies that we've put in place over the past difficult years are working very well to enable us to remain profitable even at reduced volumes. Jon and Rick will review some of these elements of our Homebuilding operations that are succeeding. Additionally, our Rialto program continues to complement our Homebuilding activity as it also adds to our overall profitability. Rialto has continued to grow and Jeff will update you on this progress in just a minute. All in all, we are very comfortable with the position of our company. We know that market conditions remain difficult. We believe that our willingness to confront the reality of market conditions, honestly and early, has enabled our company to make the important and necessary adjustments to quickly pivot to profitability and to properly position for the future. Let me turn over now to Jon.
Jonathan Jaffe: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. We're very proud of the pre-impairment 19.1% gross margin and 5% operating margin we delivered in our second quarter. I will speak to our company strategy on maximizing revenues and our intense focus on managing direct costs and overhead. On the revenue side, we are focused market-by-market on driving sales by zeroing in on today's home-buying consumer wants and needs. We deliver value by targeting the right product and features. Each of our divisions has redesigned floor plans, square footages and features to address today's customer profile. Additionally as Stuart has noted today and in past calls, we have reignited Lennar's Everything's Included platform to highlight the energy-efficient, technological and quality features that clearly differentiate our new homes as compared to the resale homes on the market. In the area of energy efficiency, which is a real differentiator when compared to used and foreclosed homes, we're designing our homes to save customers around $1,000 per year on their electric bill compared to the typical existing home. In some of our markets, we have homeowners who experience monthly electric bills that average below $10. We are also including home automation technology that allows our homeowners to control door locks, lighting, thermostats, cameras and more through their Smart phone, iPad or computer. These today's technology features allow homeowners to enjoy their home in a way that previously, either wasn't available or it's too expensive for them. We believe this strategy is allowing us to maximize our sales and sales price by giving customers a reason to buy in the current difficult market environment.  On the cost side of the margin equation and at the same time as we are executing our Everything's Included strategy to include more features that appeal to today's customer, we continue to drive down the direct cost of construction. Our current average direct cost at homes are approximately $40 per square foot. This is down over 30% from the 2006 peak and is a year-over-year reduction of over 5%. We achieved this result through the hard work of extremely well-coordinated national and local purchasing teams that continually find the answers on how to deliver more value for less. We've also stayed focused on bringing down our cycle time which is now down 27% from the peak. This is accomplished by working hand-in-hand with our trade partners and designing and building more efficient value-engineered homes. This effort has allowed us to control our fuel cost and effectively manage our inventory. We have also maintained our intense management of SG&A. As market headwinds result in downward pressure on home prices, we know that we have to [indiscernible] every day to reduce our cost structure. Despite the cost associated with new community growth and today's overall lower absorption levels, our year-over-year SG&A spent for second quarter was flat at $97 million. At 14.9%, this represents a year-over-year increase of 100 basis points due to the decline in revenues of 6%. To put our overhead focus into perspective, at the peak of the market in 2006, SG&A was $484 -- $484 million compared to our Q2 2011 run rate of $97 million. As Stuart mentioned, we have just completed our operations reviews with each of our Homebuilding divisions. I can tell you that despite the reality of a disappointing spring sales season, we have a team that is energized to execute on the strategy of maximizing sales revenue and the goal of maintaining industry-leading operating margins through the active management of reducing cost of sales. Thank you. I'd now like to turn it over to Rick.
Richard Beckwitt: Thanks, Jon. During the quarter, we continued to focus on acquiring or optioning new home sites that would have a positive impact on our bottom line. We signed 25 new deals to purchase approximately 2,900 homesites. About half of these deals were option contracts where we put up a small deposit and have a right to take down the land over time. The remaining deals were cash purchases or distressed loan purchases where we subsequently foreclose on the land. Our land spend during the quarter was approximately $109 million, down about $50 million from the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we owned or controlled approximately 108,000 homesites. All of these new deals in the quarter were underwritten with extremely conservative underwriting assumptions. They assumed no price increases and in some cases, price declines, slower decline in sales basis and where price to yield gross margins and IRRs exceeding 20%. Jon and I review every transaction regardless of size and absolutely no money leaves this company without a thumbs-up from me, Jon or Stuart. Today, we've been very pleased with the performance of our new communities, even as the market has trended downward. During the second quarter, approximately 30% of our deliveries came from communities purchased or put other contract in the last 2 years. Our gross margin on the closings in these communities was approximately 21% or about 200 basis points higher than the gross margin for the entire company in the second quarter. From a geographic standpoint, approximately 32% of the new deals are located in Florida; 20% in Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas; 18% in California; 13% in Texas, but the remaining 17% spread throughout our other markets. Our focus within these markets has been on desirable communities located in submarkets where people really want to live. Whether the hook at schools, spectacular amenities or commute time, each one of these new deals has been selected with a very specific target buyer in mind. In short, we've stayed away from fringe locations or opportunities where price was the only driver. Given our laser-type focus on land, our product strategy has been a key driver to our success in these communities. We have ensured that we have a cost-effective home design in hand before we buy land, which has allowed us to streamline the time period between when we buy and when we're open for sales. It's a true cash-on-cash focus. We don't want to waste on chasing deals that fall outside of our floor plan universe. This allows us to use realtime and proven cost information when we underwrite new deals . As I've mentioned in the past, we've been direct sourcing the lion's share of our deals and have tried to stay away from the broker-to-bid transactions. This has allowed us to get in early, buy and try out multiple deals at a time and negotiate much more favorable pricing in turns. I have no doubt that we have the most talented and hard-working land team in the business. This team working together with our Rialto associates has been particularly effective. We've worked closely with the banks, partnered with the government, bought foreclosed properties, tax certificates and community development bonds . We think that some of the best opportunities are the more complicated deals. and I'd like to thank our team for their hard work and dedication.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Krasnoff, the CEO of our Rialto operations.
Jeffrey Krasnoff: Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As he does each quarter, Bruce will shortly be reviewing the details behind our $9.8 million of operating earnings, along with the results for the year and the rest of the company. From an operating standpoint, Rialto's real estate portfolio, securities and investment management businesses continued to be very busy. During the quarter, our Rialto real estate fund, in which the company had both a major investor and the manager, closed on 2 new distressed real estate loan portfolio transactions representing $140 million of unpaid principal balance. But we've also tied up another 8 new loan portfolios, which subject to completion of closing conditions, should add loans with an additional $350 million of unpaid principal balance. We also closed on 2 new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions and have 2 in the pipeline, representing a total of $320 million of securities, backed by over $5.5 billion of newly underwritten cash flow in commercial real estate loans. All told with the transactions we've already completed and those in our pipeline, we estimate in the next 30 to 60 days the fund will have invested approximately $340 million in equity since its inception late last year, to buy approximately $940 million in assets at a little over a 60% discount to par. As a reminder, in addition to the approximately $450 million of equity it has invested directly before the inception of the fund, the company has committed $75 million to be invested through the fund and has the ability to co-invest in larger transactions. The additional equity commitments that we expect to add in closings in the near future will be adjusting the company's ownership percentage in the approximately $370 million of commitments closed to date. As we've mentioned in the past, we've received fees for pursuing and money managing fund investments and we also earned incentive fees based on the funds performance. Since we last reported to you, along with other fixed income assets classes, RMBS and CMBS have experienced a widening in spreads, thereby increasing yields and reducing pricing. As Bruce will walk through, this had an impact on our mark-to-market this quarter for our investment in our PPIP fund with AllianceBernstein. But it also increased the attractiveness of certain targeted securities. Therefore, for the first time in several quarters, our PPIP fund has called additional capital in order to be prepared for attractive acquisition opportunities. On the operations side, we continue to build an outstanding team of professionals, which has now grown to over 150 associates across the country. Our team is currently evaluating an unusually large pipeline of opportunities primarily from financial institutions, divesting troubled loans that are burdening the balance sheets. Our already in-place managers are today, working out loans, dealing with similar underlying collateral on the same markets and in a number of cases, the same borrowers. If we're able to purchase assets at our pricing, we're positioned to quickly and efficiently bring those assets right into our already in-place workout machine.  And because of a higher percentage of loans made to developers, being able to efficiently incorporate the homebuilding team's unique view and expertise gives us another distinct advantage in our evaluation and maximization of value for these assets. As part of this active collaboration, the Homebuilding divisions have also been able to capture distressed opportunities from the same institutions we've been working with on the portfolios, the mechanism to generate new communities at extremely attractive pricing. Since we started this program, this has led directly to the company's investment of almost $100 million to acquire thousands of extremely well-located homesites for use in the company's Homebuilding operations. We remain very excited about our growing franchise, our current position in the marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team. And we look forward to reporting to you on our progress in future quarters.
B. Gross: Thanks, Jeff. This is Bruce Gross. Revenues from home sales decreased 6% to $650 million during the quarter, and that was due to a 9% decrease in home deliveries, excluding joint ventures which is partially offset by a 2% increase in average sales price to $245,000. The average sales price by region is as follows: the East region, $233,000, up 5%; the Central region, $209,000, up 6%; Houston, $231,000, up 7%; the West region, $308,000 down 3%; and the other category, $269,000, up 6%. The changes in average sales price were primarily due to product mix during the quarter.  During this quarter, we had only $3 million of Homebuilding community impairments, which is the lowest quarterly Homebuilding impairment amount since we've started the impairment cycle 5 years ago. Our gross margin on home sales pre-impairment was 19.9% as Jon mentioned, and that compares with the same pre-impairment amounts of 21.4% in the prior year and 21.1% in the first quarter. Gross margins were strongest in the East region this quarter. The gross margins from our new communities continue to outperform, but were partially offset by a modest increase in sales incentives on homes closed. Sales incentives increased by $2,800 from the prior year to $33,900, an increase of approximately $800 from the first quarter. As a result of the strong operating leverage noted in our sequential 150 basis point improvement in SG&A to 14.9%, our Homebuilding operating margin, also pre-impairment, also improved sequentially from the first quarter as it was up 30 basis points to 5%. Other income net totaled $9.5 million in the second quarter, of which $5.1 million was due to the hard work of our associates and resulting in a favorable resolution of a joint venture. And the remainder was primarily management fees and interest income which you typically see each quarter. Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $2.3 million for the quarter versus $13.7 million in the prior year. The reduction was due to decreased volume in both our mortgage and title operations and the prior year results included a $5.1 million gain relating to the sale of a cable system. Mortgage pretax income during the quarter, was $5.3 million and that compares to $9.3 million in the prior year. And our title company had a $2.2 million loss compared to a $400,000 loss in the prior year. Our Rialto business segment generated operating earnings of $9.8 million and this number is net of $12.9 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. The composition of Rialto's $9.8 million of operating earnings by type of investment is as follows: $9.5 million is a contribution from our 40% share of the FDIC portfolios; $11.9 million from non-FDIC portfolios; $2.4 million loss is from PPIP, that's approximately $8.3 million of G&A and other expenses which are net of management fee income.  The $9.5 million of contribution from the FDIC portfolios this quarter is primarily from accretable interest income, collections from guarantors and gains upon foreclosure of REO. The $11.0 million of contributions from the non-FDIC portfolios is comprised of accretable interest income, sale of REO, gains upon foreclosure of REO and a $4.7 million gain on the sale of the CMBS bond.  The $2.4 million loss during the quarter from our investment in PPIP, as Jeff discussed, is reported as the equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. And this loss is comprised of a $5.5 million unrealized loss due to the mark-to-market adjustment from the widening of spreads discussed by Jeff. This was partially offset by $2.6 million of interest income in the PPIP. At quarter end, Rialto continued to generate cash. They had $160 million in the diffusive cash account to retire debt and there was an additional $70 million of cash on Rialto's balance sheet. Lennar's balance sheet continued to be strong and liquid at the end of the second quarter and our leverage remained low. Our Homebuilding debt to total capital net of $945 million of cash was 44.9% at the end of the quarter. And inventory, excluding consolidated inventory not owned, stayed flat at $3.9 billion. Our backlog conversion ratio during the quarter increased to 138% as we remained focused on carefully managing our inventory levels. This conversion ratio was higher than normal as a result of our successful focus on reducing our completed unsold home inventory count from a 1,059 at the end of the first quarter to 696 at the end of the second quarter. We had 449 active communities at the end of the quarter. And as a result of another profitable quarter, we were able to continue to reduce our deferred tax asset reserve, which now stands at $599 million. Shareholders' equity increased to $2.65 billion with a book value per share of $14.18. In conclusion, we are pleased with our continuation at reporting quarterly profits. And given the current market conditions, we remain confident that 2011 will be another profitable year for the company. And with that, we'll turn it over for questions.
Operator: At this time, we will now begin our formal question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Dan Oppenheim of Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: I was wondering if you can start off talking about the strategy in Homebuilding business? Touch about your focus on minimizing the level of specs there. But if you look at the backlog conversion, you'd see in that you've got a lot of homes there converting to sales pretty quickly. How do you strive on terms of what you're doing to specs and how you're managing that process?
Stuart Miller: So, Dan, with respect to managing the specs, we're matching our sales in our construction pace. This particular quarter, we had about an extra 360 or so homes that we're able to close because they were completed and our strategy is to focus on those homes and keep that count as low as possible. But from the standpoint of what we're starting in construction, and Jon maybe you want to touch on this, we're matching out with our sales base.
Jonathan Jaffe: Sure. We monitor the absorption community-by-community and accordingly, set a start pace for that specific community. Those things end up -- we experienced in today's market is that our biggest competitor is the existing home. And the brokers, particularly, and the customers are comparing a finished home to our homes. And the ability to have some homes that are near completion really allows us to compete more effectively with the existing home. And of course, our focus on cycle time also allows us to effectively control the fact we started some homes that aren't sold yet.
Daniel Oppenheim - Crédit Suisse AG: Great. And the second question. Wondering about the pipeline or transaction of Rialto business, that's unusually large. Any sense in terms of what you've been seeing in the past, since you've been looking transactions in the pipeline? What end -- percent end the up closing? How realistic it looks to be in terms of, say, large volume here and the next couple of months?
Stuart Miller: It's Stuart, maybe Jeff will follow up. But in terms of pipeline, our pipeline percentage that end up closing, it's been about 100%. We're pretty much looking at a pipeline that we don't tie up unless we have done due diligence ahead of time. And we have a pretty strong degree of certainty that we're going to close the deals that we've tied up. In terms of the pipeline of activity that's out there, there's no question that the market is really starting to put out a lot of product that has been pent-up and saved up inside of the lending institutions for some time. So the activity is clearly getting pretty heavy right now. We're underwriting a pipeline of new potential deals that is much larger than we've seen over the past quarters. And we expect this activity to continue for sometime now. Jeff?
Jeffrey Krasnoff: Yes. No, I'd say a large percentage then, of what we're looking at are negotiated transactions. And usually when we start going down a path, we typically end up with the deal at the end of the day. It was some give-and-take with the financial institutions. In some cases, we do if we think that it's going to be a very thinly bid transaction. We may bid some transactions and there might be a few of those that don't get done because they don't get done at our price. But for the most part, the supply right now is overwhelming a number of qualified buyers really in the marketplace.
Stuart Miller: And at the end of the day, the number of deals that are out there really enables us to be very selective about what we're buying and more importantly, the price at which we are purchasing.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates: We got a lot of questions from investors on is it better to be land light or have land given that the outlook seems pretty ominous right now by many? And also, should you be a move up or entry level, and seems to be a push to move up. So realizing that's 2 questions in one. If you can to help us frame your views of that. And lastly, I'll get my second question without getting back in queue. Pricing. Your view on what pricing does when you're underwriting ground, do you think it's going to continue to go down in the next 12 months?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, on the land light versus land heavy side, Ivy, this is Rick. We're being very opportunistic with regard to what we're putting under contract, how we're underwriting it and when we're investing the dollars. All we can really point to is what the numbers have been with regard to the investments. Pretty much across-the-board, we've invested in new opportunities that far exceed the gross margins in some of the legacy assets. So from a cash investment and a return standpoint, those things have been really money good. As we look at the cycle and we look at the opportunities out there, we have changed some focus at various times in different markets from some of the finished product that's available out there because some of that has been bid up to things that may be more busted deals, to give us an opportunity for really outsized returns as we fix the issues that are out there. Pricing, we've seen pricing bounce around. As I said in some of the prepared remarks, when we underwrite these deals we underwrite them with multiple variables in mind. We look at them on a base case as if everything is flat. We look at them with declining sales prices, declining absorption rates, cost inflation. Really, we split it and we analyze it in multiple ways. At the end of the day, it needs to pass muster at the worst-case scenario based on absorptions, based on price decline, based on cost inflation and all of those type of variables. And once it does that, we make the investment decision.
Stuart Miller: Let me just add to that. You asked about pricing assumptions relative to our underwriting. We're buying a variety of types of properties these days. Some of them are shorter term under a land-light kind of concept. In those instances, we are not making pricing assumptions to the upside or downside. We're looking at normal market conditions. We're coming out [Audio Gap] staying very close to the market. We are probably more predisposed more towards move up right now. But in longer-term land positions, we're leaving ourselves a lot of flexibility. I don't think that we can look at current market conditions as a proxy as for where the market is going to go over the next couple of years.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan Chase.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co: First question just on May. In the press release, you discussed that being up 30% year-over-year in terms of order, so I was wondering if you could give us a sense of sales pace and also how pricing and incentive trends have been relative to -- sequentially relative to April? Just as -- just, month-to-month how you've seen things trend?
B. Gross: Sure, Mike, this is Bruce. The sequential trend from April was pretty flat as you look at pricing and as you look at the sales incentive trend. So we've hit somewhat of a stable point. It was sequentially improving throughout the year and from April to May, it's pretty flat.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And that flatness would then be also with regards to sales pace?
B. Gross: Yes, sales pace is about flat as well.
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. Second question on the gross margin. Still staying in that essentially 20% to 21% range, and I think basically, you said last quarter that the backlog gross margins were up approximately 20% -- at the 20% level. So I guess the question is going forward to the next couple of quarters, do you expect to remain essentially in that 20% to 21%? Or given the, perhaps say, increase from closings in new communities over to the extent that you can perhaps achieve some further benefits from lowered cost per square foot, are there any things that might drive your expectations towards higher -- the higher end of that 20% to 21%? Or just how should we think about that going forward?
Richard Beckwitt: Hey, Mike, this is Rick. As I said last quarter, I think the zip codes that you really should focus on is really 19% to 21%. Because Jon and I, every month, every week, are making pricing decisions with regard to market movements that are realtime. Clearly, the new communities have the ability to push the overall blended gross margin up to the higher end of that range, but we have to react on a daily basis to the local market movements, the traffic conditions and it's going to sort of move in that category. And if you look at the guidance that we gave you last time, we sort of came in right the middle of that curve.
Jonathan Jaffe: Mike, to your point about direct cost reduction. We continue to look forward and expect we're going to have to continue to reduce cost structure in the current market environment knowing that price pressure can continue to move downward and so we're forward-thinking and forward-looking in terms of what's the next solution to deliver value and reduce cost.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank: My first question actually is something of a follow-up to Mike's question and I appreciate the details on the cycle times and the direct cost per square foot. But I'm trying to get an idea of how you guys benchmark your efficiency and your purchasing relative to kind of your internal goals and your targets and also relative to what your competitors are doing? I'm just trying to get an idea coming to do what's left for you there in your minds? And how do you kind of -- as you think about it over time? How do you determine how well you're doing? It seems pretty impressive. So?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, from a benchmark standpoint, I think that we feel that we're doing the best job in the industry. And we've got great people in the field. We've got excellent purchasing folks. We are construction superintendents. Our builders out there are focused on keeping that house moving from the date we pour the slab until we give the keys to the buyer. So cycle time is incredibly important in this company. And how much further can we compress that time period? That's going to be a lot driven by the increased efficiency in the designs and some of the things that we're doing along those side. From a cost perspective, the purchasing perspective, we're continuing to battle with some of the influence of the manufacturers are trying to push costs up. But we've been very effective in keeping things down. And what's going to be interesting is what happens when the cycle turns and how much of that cost increase that we can battle against. But I think that when that happens, we should be able to more of -- than offset that with price increases of a product.
Stuart Miller: At the end of the day, I think that we've set no limits on ourselves as to how far we can drive cycle time down and cost down. We think that there is room for marginal improvement. As volumes go down, everybody through the supply chain is under pressure. And we keep that pressure applied. We recognize that there's going to be some give-back as the market comes back. But while the market has been trending lower, we are looking for participation from the cost side of the equation to keep us in a steady profitable zone. So we think that there will be more movement. We know that there's pressure to the upside. Everybody is trying to make a dollar here. But while the market is moving down, we think that we can make some more improvement.
David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank: Got it. And then just my follow-up question here. Interesting to hear about more type with the reinvigoration of Everything's Included. I'm wondering if you can talk about -- you also talk about, in your individual communities and individual markets, building the product that meets the customer demand. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how your Everything's Included product, what is included, differs market-to-market, buyer segment to buyer segment? Do you find that people generally want the same things in those 3 markets and so you get to know purchasing power on more of a national basis in one of those products or is it kind of different market-to-market? Can you give us some color on that?
Stuart Miller: Let's start by thinking about it this way and Jon will add to this. Think of Everything's Included as kind of a 3-tiered program in today's world. It's about an energy program. It's about technologies, modern technologies. And it's about included features. We are fully focused on energy savings as a differentiation mechanism from used and foreclosure homes. That's our biggest competitor. And it's the biggest area of vulnerability for that competitor. New homes offer a better energy program and we're doing everything we can to enhance that and that's pretty much across-the-board. The energy component of Everything's Included is something that -- it might vary somewhat market-to-market based on whether we can do solar in one market or wind loads in Florida and things like that. But we're focused on the energy component. Technology comes down to you wouldn't buy a car with roll-down windows. We want to enhance the technology around our homes to where we're competing with that existing home market, aggressively, by enhancing the technology, today's technology, around homeownership. That means keyless entry doors and switch-less lightning and stuff like that. We think that we can enhance that program and that we're doing market-to-market. The features component of our Everything's Included program is a highly researched, highly market-focused component. And that's the third leg of Everything's Included. And there, we do a lot of product research. We are basically looking to deliver the home that our customer would select if they were going through the selection process. And that means that our people in the field are doing a lot of product research to come up with the end solution for the homebuyer that they would choose if they were choosing it on their own. So we're doing the work for them and that's very locally market-driven.
Jonathan Jaffe: That was going to be my point. It really starts with market research and it does lead us to different answers in different markets. They're just different taste relative to style and likes from someone living in Florida to somebody living in Minneapolis to someone in Phoenix. They tend to fall into common categories but the application and execution of that will definitely vary market-by-market.
Stuart Miller: Yes. And it all comes down to market-by-market, what do they want in that home, what would they select on their own? And balancing that with what they can afford and putting that package together in the most dynamic way possible.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani, KBW.
Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Just on Rialto. I wanted to find out has the timeline for deals coming the market, due diligence, spending or anything related to the process, materially changed? The things that wouldn't change is you're looking at more and more negotiated transactions. And then the follow-up would be, I take it from your comments that based on what's expected to close in the next 60 days that the opportunity fund is fully invested. Can you give the schedule of future commitments on this fund? And Lennar's incremental investment? And if you raise a follow-on fund of this size, what do you think the timeline for the capital deployment would be on that?
Stuart Miller: Well, I'd say first off, I think you hit it right. I mean, we're certainly doing a number of negotiated transactions and a number of them are would sort of repeat, are repeat sort of sellers for us. And that market, it is growing. We're trying to add new people to that program as time expands. And as it relates to the equity, I'd say that -- I mean, we're still full in the market so I can't necessarily give you a lot of information on that other than the fact that we do expect to have continuing closings on commitments with for this fund before closing it up and starting to raise the next line.
B. Gross: Well, just add to that. I think that the field of opportunity has expanded. There is a great desire on behalf of the sellers to end up with a transaction that actually closes. There's a lot of noise out there, a lot of participants in the market that are not experienced in this arena and so the certainty of close becomes a little bit more questionable with them. There's a premium placed on groups like ours that have the ability to come in and, in a credible way, diligence, the offering and come up with a deal that will actually close. We bring that to the table. That's a differentiation from how the deals had been over the past quarters. I think we have an advantage that gets us in the door. And it gives us an advantage in terms of putting together a program that we can purchase at attractive pricing. In terms of our ability to invest, we have invested the fund money very efficiently and effectively at what we think are very attractive returns. We will continue to invest fund money as we go forward. And we think that we are not going to be capital-constraint
Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: Just a clarification, is there a maximum size the opportunity fund that you could disclose? And also how you think about Lennar's capital allocation to Rialto? Is there some limit to how much you would invest? Thanks a lot.
Jonathan Jaffe: I think we've stated that in terms of this fund that Lennar's commitment is $75 million. But it also has the opportunity if there are larger transactions as to co-invest side-by-side with the fund. So we do have that. I don't believe we've actually disclosed the total amount, the maximum amount of the fund. But on the face of it the first fund is $750 million.
Stuart Miller: And let me just add. In terms of Lennar's investment, we are investing capital through our Rialto fund and through our Rialto program. The returns are really the primary driver behind how many dollars we will invest on the Rialto side versus land opportunities for the Homebuilding side. Where we find outsized returns, that's where the dollars will flow. And as a company, we remain opportunistic, opportunistically focused on how our capital gets invested. Next question?
Operator: That is coming from Megan McGrath, MKM Partners.
Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC: I wanted to follow up a little bit on the pricing environment and the incentives. Wondering if you could give any more color on the increased incentives? Did they come in a particular time in the quarter for particular product? Was it to get rid of that spec mostly? Or do you think they'll kind of stay at this elevated level at least? Did you see that in June?
Stuart Miller: On a percentage basis, it stayed relatively flat throughout the quarter. And as we've said in prior calls, we use our inventory as a tool and we price to close, to hit the pace of what the operation should achieve. We haven't seen a dramatic change, one way or the other, in post the quarter.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon. Now that -- if you look back the last 3 quarters, it's really been relatively flat. Like everything else, it's very local and it does vary by market-by-market and what's happening within those regions and submarkets.
Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC: Great, thanks. And then just a little bit of switching topic but wanted to follow up with Jeff on your comments around that unusually large pipeline. Any thought as to what's driving that on the part of the banks? Do you think it's coming under pressure? Do you think their outlook for real estate has one down? What do you think is increasing the pipeline so much?
Jeffrey Krasnoff: Well, I think it's all of the above. I think they're getting increased pressure from regulators. I think that they're also -- there is also a lot -- there is also pretty significant fatigue that's set in, in terms of some of the portfolios that they've been trying to work for some period of time. And I think that right now, they're looking at the marketplace and they're looking at the opportunity for buyers like us to be able to dispose of these assets or get them off their books. And I think that all of those dynamics is sort of work together. And on the other side of it, in terms of the -- in terms of the number of investors, there are still relatively few that have the kind of infrastructure that's required to be able to look at large portfolios that cover diverse geographic areas and property types and so on. And as a result, sort of the supply right now, the way we see it, is sort of overwhelmed the demand.
Operator: The next question is coming from Kenneth Zener of KeyBanc.
Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Hi, this is Rodny Nacier, on for Ken. I wanted to clarify on the units on the construction. How many units do you have finished and how many are under construction? And how does that compare to last quarter?
Stuart Miller: We indicated that we have 696 that are completed unsold, which compares to 1,059 last quarter. And what's under construction both sold and unsold is approximately 3,700 versus just under 3,000 last quarter.
Rodny Nacier - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Okay. And with 449 communities at the end of 2Q, how many communities do you expect to have active at the end of 2011?
Stuart Miller: We don't project that, Rodny, because it's too hard to predict how many communities would be falling off as well. The number will increase because we're finding good opportunities and investing capital. But we don't actually put a prediction out because it's too hard to project that.
Operator: The next question is coming from Nishu Sood, Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG: This is actually Rob Hansen on for Nishu. You briefly touched about -- touched on lending standards. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on how tight they are. And we've recently heard from one builder that said that for the first time in 3 years, there's a slight easing in lending standards. So I'm just wondering if you get your thoughts on that.
Stuart Miller: Well, okay. That kind of takes me a little bit by surprise that you're getting that feedback. I think that the lending standards are pretty tight right now. And even stated standards where you might find that a FICO score of 580 is prescribed, the actual underwriting is probably solving to something in the 620 or 640 range, with conservatism built-in, given the fact that some of the rules are uncertain and some of the hold back requirements and requirements to almost guarantee loans that are being put in programs was out there. It's our experience that there is a lot of pressure to maintain kind of an ultraconservative spend on kind of government-sponsored loans. We think that, that kind of a crimp in the demand that's naturally out there right now. And it seems that over time, there will be a form of loosening of that tightened credit standard. When that will actually take place or how it will be effectuated is something that I don't think anybody can predict right now. But I do think that financing is a big limiting factor for natural normalization of demand right now and it's an opportunity for the housing market as we look ahead. An opportunity for the market to correct.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon. As you think about it, in every market of record affordability which typically brings out first-time buyers who weren't able to afford to purchase a home in better times. And what we're seeing today for that first-time buyer, the administrative hurdles of credit today make it very difficult. And so that demand that is out there, as Stuart noted, it's very hard to convert into an national homeowner.
Operator: The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Most of my questions have been answered but this one, its's the first of those housekeeping. If you could tell me on owned versus option lots, and then had a question on SG&A. I would've expected probably, I think a little bit less, a sequential increase in SG&A given, with, I guess is, much more operating leverage there, more of a kind of a fixed cost we're currently running at. So I was wondering if you could comment on that and maybe, if possible, break out within the SG&A. What part of those expenses might have been attributed to new community openings?
Stuart Miller: Let me give you the piece that is, I'm going to say, something controlled. We had 108,000 total owned and controlled of which 91,000 was the owned piece during the quarter. And as you're looking at SG&A sequentially, keep in mind that we've been opening at least, I think, it's around 50 communities or so per quarter. And as part of that, we do expense some of the cost of the models and grand openings before you have any deliveries. So there is a piece of that, that goes, but I don't have the exact percentage per se but that's [Audio Gap]
Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: We could assume that there could still be some additional cost running through there? And any idea that I think some of the builders have talked about being a somewhat of the fixed cost level right now? And you could -- you can increase volume without any corresponding increase in expenses, is that potentially little bit inaccurate given that you have all the new community openings still?
Stuart Miller: Well, here is the way we look at SG&A. We think there is significant operating leverage in SG&A. And the formula that we've put out there is as we open a new community in an existing division, the incremental SG&A percentage attributable to new deliveries in that community is about 7%. So we think as we go forward and we increase deliveries from this recent community openings, there is operating leverage that will reduce the SG&A percentage going forward.  And I think we'll take one more question.
Operator: The last question is coming from Stephen East, Ticonderoga.
Unknown Analyst - : This is Paul Shobalfian [ph] on for Stephen. Your orders have been trending down for several quarters now in Houston and I was wondering if you might be able to give a little bit of color on the reason behind that?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, this is Rick. Houston continues to be a very tough market. We've had some things go on in the market that are somewhat aberrational starting with the oil spill. And stemming from that, the curtailment of a lot of oil and gas spend given the activity that went on there. In addition, there was the Continental-United merger, which was had a big impact on the employment base there. And we're starting to see stabilization of what we've got going on in Houston. From an income statement, the division still operates on a profit for us. And we're looking at over the next several quarters to see that turnaround. We think our communities are very well located there. There's no doubt in our mind that we're really outperforming the competition in that market. It's just very noticeable when you had a very large division that we've broken out on individual line item go through a very tough market correction.
Unknown Analyst - : Okay. And then your community count growth was a little bit lower than we were expecting this quarter. And I guess that you've been opening roughly 50 communities a quarter. Were there more closings, close-outs this quarter?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, there were several communities that came to their end, either because we built through them or decided to walk away from them. Benefiting from the options structure that we have with regards to those deals. You will see through the balance of the year as things come on book and things move off. We are very encouraged when we get to move through some of our asset base. And so that -- we view that as a pretty good thing.
Unknown Analyst - : So the net increase is probably in line with what we should expect this quarter as far as community growth?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, as Bruce said, what we're trying not to give you projections on community count. The timing of when they open, there's lots of variables. But I think that the trajectory is towards the up side. And that's what we've said for the last several quarters
Stuart Miller: Great. Well, thank you everybody for joining us. And we look forward to keeping you posted on our progress and reporting again, next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your conference host, Mr. Stuart Miller, CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Okay, good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2011 update. We're certainly pleased to announce our first quarter results.  Now although I'm in California this morning, I'm joined from Miami by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, is here with me; Rick [Rick Beckwitt], our soon-to-be President, is in Miami with Bruce and group; and Jeff Krasnoff is actually out of the country so he won't be able to join us today. I apologize in advance if we're a little bit disjointed on the Q&A. We're going to try to go back and forth and make sure the right person is answering questions. I'm going to begin with some brief opening remarks about the current housing market in general and the progress that we've made in managing our business, and Bruce is going to provide additional detail on our numbers. As always I'd like to request that in our Q&A period, everyone please limit to just one question, one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants.  Let me start this morning by cutting to the chase, and let me say that the long-awaited selling season of 2011 has not yet defined itself as the beginning of a recovery cycle. While we continue to see promising signs that a recovery is forming and that housing will rebound, there continue to be negative pressures on volume and sales prices. Nevertheless, specific submarkets continue to perform well, and MLS listings have declined in many of our markets and the foreclosure pipeline as measured by delinquency rates has trended down. We've all seen evidence of a sluggish recovery in the reported national sales numbers for both existing homes and new homes, and we have clearly seen the same on a realtime basis in the field. We feel, however, that reported numbers will begin to show signs of life as we get into the second half of the year and comparisons become more favorable. While traffic has at times felt promising and pointed to a potential start of a recovery cycle, it has been more in the nature of a head fake and has lacked any sustained substance that might define a clear upward trend. The state of the market is still generally soft with pockets in micro markets that are stabilizing. As I've noted in many past quarterly conference calls, the housing, recession, depression that started well over five years ago has altered the landscape of the housing market in ways that will be with us for some time to come. We continue to believe that the housing recovery will take time and patience and will be inconsistent and uneven from submarket to submarket but ultimately, there will be a recovery and it will be strong. Every day that the market languishes is another day that our industry is underserving the true need for shelter given our national population growth and household formation. Given the current landscape, we're very pleased to report a profitable first quarter with earnings of $27.4 million that comes from a contribution of solid Homebuilding and Financial Services performance, a strong contribution from Rialto and a strong focus by our management team on seeking the recovery of money spent over the past years. At present, we're very comfortable with our operating strategy at Lennar and feel that we're properly positioned to be able to benefit from the current and future market conditions.  Opportunistically, we've positioned ourselves to sustain our Homebuilding operation at breakeven or modest profitability while the market stabilizes. At the same time, we are well-situated with our Rialto program to capitalize on distressed opportunities in the market as the market sorts itself out. Concurrently, our management team is looking for every opportunity to recover dollars that were spent as market conditions deteriorated over the past years. On the Homebuilding side, we continue to focus on maximizing operational efficiency in order to achieve profitability in these difficult market conditions and benefit from real operating leverage as the market recovers. In every one of our divisions, we've created new product that is desirable in today's market while offering fewer plans and redesigning efficient plans that allow us to minimize costs. We've used efficient designs as a foundation to renegotiate costs and to reduce those costs by an average of 25%, enabling us to achieve maximum gross margins. While some of these costs will rise as demand returns and will be passed on through price increases, many of the cost efficiencies will benefit our ongoing cost structure permanently. Cycle times also continue to come down due to our new, more efficient product. We've simply never run a more efficient program in the field for both the building and the purchasing side of our business.  Additionally, we've reignited our Everything's Included marketing platform in order to ensure that Lennar Homes always offer the very best value proposition in the marketplace. Lennar's Everything's Included platform has always delivered the best value in our markets by targeting the options and upgrades that are most desirable to the customers, including them in the home offering and eliminating options and upgrades.  We've also rightsized our operations. We've reduced our SG&A in each of our operating divisions so that we are sized with appropriate personnel to operate profitably at today's depressed volumes, while maintaining our most talented associates who will be able to drive even greater earnings as market conditions improve.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we've continued to purchase strategic new communities in the best locations and submarkets and have used these community purchases to help drive gross margins higher. We've been very selective to purchase only those communities that will drive our gross margins to the upside, and we've avoided the competitive bids that have resulted in driving land prices higher. Overall, we have carefully repositioned our Homebuilding operations to hold steady while the market finds a bottom and stabilizes. We're well positioned with real operating leverage to drive our bottom line when market conditions stabilize and improve. Rialto continues to be a bright spot for the company. As distress continues to resolve itself in the markets overall, Rialto stands ready to invest in and manage the reconciliation of that distress. If the market remains impaired, Rialto will find more business opportunities. And as the market recovers, both Rialto and our Homebuilding operations will benefit from both operating leverage and price recovery. While Bruce will go into more detail on the numbers in a few minutes, similar to last quarter, the major contributors to Rialto's $11 million of operating earnings in the fourth quarter are our share of the profits from distressed real estate portfolio transactions, our Public-Private Investment fund activities with AllianceBernstein and the U.S. Department of Treasury, known as PPIP, and the fees that we received from others for our management of these investments.  During the quarter, we closed on two new transactions, representing an additional $130 million of unpaid principal balance. We've also tied up three new loan portfolios, which subject to completion of closing conditions, should add another $160 million of unpaid balance. In addition, we are in the process of acquiring two new issue commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions representing $100 million of bonds. These CMBS transactions should provide a level of recurring cash flow and interest income along with outsized returns. All of these new investments are being made by our Rialto real estate fund.  As we reported to you at the end of the year, we had our first closing of approximately $300 million of equity commitments for our fund, which included the company's $75 million contribution. Because we also received fees for pursuing and managing fund investments, it should also provide another opportunity for us to offset an additional component of our overhead and to earn incentive fees based on our performance. All told, in just the past year, we acquired approximately 6,000 loans and 300 real estate properties, with an unpaid balance or self-appraised value of approximately $4 billion. With unpaid, accrued and default interests and other amounts due from borrowers, this is an excess of $4.6 billion. We acquired these assets for approximately $1.6 billion or $0.35 on the dollar. And after accounting for solo financing and our partner’s equity interest, our net investment was approximately $460 million. Although we did not add significant new investments in our PPIP fund with AllianceBernstein over the past few quarters due to the increased pricing of our targeted assets, in a little over a year, we have invested approximately 85% of our $4.6 billion of purchasing power to buy $6.5 billion in face of RMBS and CMBS. From the beginning, our focus has been on acquiring securities with resilient cash flows with the goal of collecting a mid- to high teens return by holding these assets until maturity. Nevertheless, while it is still early in the program, based on a mark-to-market of the underlying collateral and the principal and interest collected to date, our fund has operated at a gross 50% annualized internal rate of return while it continues to distribute an 8% current dividend.  We continue to benefit from these results due to the $64 million we have invested to date as part of our $75 million commitment. Note that this includes the approximately $2 million of annual management fees that we are currently collecting and our 22.5% share of the carried interest to be earned by our partnership group. On the operations side, we continue to build an outstanding team of professionals that now approximates 129 associates across the country. While our detailed due diligence reviews combined with our resolution process and real estate operating capabilities allow us to look at distressed portfolios on a wholesale basis and through our operations bring value to individual assets on a retail basis.  Our disciplined loan workout and resolution process were initially designed almost two decades ago to maximize proceeds and returns from distressed assets. In our regularly scheduled Asset Manager meetings, our team methodically and professionally approaches and deals with the underlying borrowers and tees up many of the resolutions that have to date exceeded our initial underwritings.  We are now deep into all of our 2010 portfolios, having had contact with borrowers representing over 90% of the combined outstanding loan balances. And our first two transactions with the FDIC, for which we took over management almost one year ago, we have now fully resolved over 300 assets and have brought in over $213 million in cash, with our team achieving an average resolution of over $0.83 on the dollar.  We now have $201 million on the partnership balance sheet. Approximately $126 million of this is earmarked to defease the original $627 million of acquisition financing, and the rest is available as working capital to help maximize the resolution of these assets. We believe that our team and the infrastructure we have in place today is already way ahead of the pack and is setting the standards for best practices in the industry. This has positioned us extremely well for a growing pipeline of opportunity from the FDIC, from banks and from others. We remain very excited about our growing franchise and our current position in our marketplace and the synergies with the rest of the Lennar team, and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress in Rialto in the future. I feel that I would be remiss if I did not mention the activities surrounding the Nick Marsh, Barry Minkow accusations that hurt our company back in January 2009. By now, I am sure that all of you are aware that Barry Minkow has been charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and plans to plead guilty to that charge this week. We believe that the investigation into other parties is ongoing as well. While I do not want to rehash this very difficult time in our history nor do I want to find vindication in the uncovering of this crime against our company, I do want to highlight some important notes.  First, you will note that we are reporting today a $37.5 million income item in the "other category." As noted in our press release, this is a recovery that relates to a confidential settlement with a third party, not the developer, third party in connection with Lennar's ongoing dispute with Nicholas Marsh III and his affiliates. As a result of the settlement, the third party paid Lennar total cash consideration of $37.5 million. While the terms of this settlement are confidential and we will not comment on it beyond this statement, the recovery repays some of the dollars that have been spent defending our reputation and demonstrates the conviction of our company when our reputation is attacked.  Second, immediately following Misters Marsh and Minkow's accusations against Lennar, we countered with facts and figures to highlight that these claims were false. At Lennar, we place the highest premium on integrity and work diligently to make sure that when we speak, every word can be trusted, not as spin, but as truth. We hope we have earned your respect in the way that we report our numbers each quarter and year, by the way that we deal with customers, partners and investors alike and by the way that we report on macro conditions relating to the state of the Homebuilding market and the economy. We expect that the finding of criminal activities surrounding the dissemination of false information that clouded our company for some time properly validates the many responses we have given you over the past two and half years and allows us all to move on once and for all.  Finally, we believe that this incident clearly validates the good work and important role of our industry analysts. On January 9, with news hitting the press that caught us all by surprise, every one of our industry analysts jumped to action to investigate and respond with the best independent information available at the time. Over the ensuing days and weeks, there were countless calls and meetings hosted by this group that became the forum for reconciling what was said and what was real. While we could not always convince them of our position without sometimes painstaking diligent research, they all listened to our position, reviewed our materials and became an independent voice for fact and fact-checking that we could not have provided to the market on our own. They were the independent voice for the investor community, and we thank all of you on the line for your work. Overall, in the context of a very difficult market, we are pleased with the progress that we've made as reflected in our first quarter result and more importantly, with the general direction of our company’s strategy. Homebuilding and Financial Services remain positioned to be profitable in today's uncertain times and to drive materially improved profits as the market stabilizes and ultimately begins to recover. At the same time, our Rialto strategy is building momentum in this distressed environment, as it grows both new and exciting opportunities to invest company capital and as well, real bottom line profitability.  Our management team remains focused on finding recoveries of dollars that we’ve spent as the market deteriorated. At the end of the day, our people continue to be the bright spot in our company. The dedication and focus in all parts of our company are reflected in our positive results in the toughest of environments. From the execution of business plans in the field to the cooperative spirit that exists between the Lennar Homebuilding and Rialto segments of our company, from sourcing new business opportunities to finding dollar recoveries of money spent, our people are really making a difference. More importantly, our in-place management team and overall staffing are positioned to drive real operating leverage as market conditions ultimately improve. While we remain cautious about the immediate future, we believe that we have properly positioned our company to succeed in the current environment and excel when the market recovers. We will continue to make strategic and opportunistic investments and focus on every aspect of our cost structure as we look forward to continue to be profitable throughout 2011.  And with that, let me turn over to Bruce.
B. Gross: Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. We indicated on our fourth quarter conference call that the first quarter will be challenged due to low volume expectations. However, as Stuart mentioned, we still generated a $27.4 million bottom line profit, and I'll provide some more details behind those results.  Revenues from home sales decreased 11% to $458 million. That was due to a 4% decrease in home deliveries, excluding joint ventures, and a 7% decrease in average sale price. While the company's average sale price decreased to $240,000 from $258,000 in the prior year, it actually increased sequentially from the $238,000 reported in our fourth quarter. If you break down the average sales price by region, the East was $225,000, which is down 2%; Central, $211,000, up 1%; Houston, $222,000, up 4%; and the West was $301,000, which was down 20%, and that was primarily due to a lower price product strategy implemented in our Las Vegas market and a product mix that was different in our California market during the quarter; the Other region was $265,000, and that was up 4%. So the average sales prices remained relatively stable over the last four quarters now right around that $240,000 mark.  Our gross margin on home sales improved to 20% during the quarter, and that compares with 19.2% in the prior year. Our gross margins were strongest in the East and West regions. The improvement in gross margin continues to be due to a combination of deliveries from new communities with higher gross margins, the continued focus on controlling costs and a reduction in sales incentives on homes closed. Sales incentives declined by $4,000 from the prior year to $33,100, and this is flat from our fourth quarter results.  During the quarter, we had $4.8 million of homebuilding community impairments versus $6.1 million in the prior year's quarter. The pre-impairment gross margin, for those that want to look at it that way for the quarter, was up to 21.1% and that compares favorably to the pre-impairment gross margin of 20.3% last year in the first quarter and 20.8% in the fourth quarter.  Our SG&A as a percentage of home sales was 16.4% compared with 15.8% in the prior year. However, the absolute dollars declined by $5.7 million. There were two non-recurring items included in SG&A this quarter. First was a $6.6 million charge relating to expenses associated with remediating an assumed liability from a previously acquired company; and second, $8 million of the $37.5 million settlement, that Stuart discussed, was classified as a reduction to SG&A.  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was $0.7 (sic) [$8.7 million] versus an $8.9 million loss in the prior year. The gain was primarily a result of restructuring of debt at our El Toro joint venture, which resulted in a $15.4 million gain. This is our share of the gain from extinguishment of debt at the joint venture level. As part of this restructure, we also extended the debt maturity out to 2018, thereby positioning this venture's capital structure to be well-matched with the long-term strategic asset that we have at El Toro in the middle of Orange County. This gain was partially offset by $4.5 million of valuation adjustments in our own unconsolidated entities.  Other income net totaled $30 million in the first quarter versus $14.2 million in the prior year. The main item here is $29.5 million of the $37.5 million settlement described by Stuart. Additionally, we were able to recognize $10 million of previously deferred management fees relating to one of our joint ventures this quarter. There were $13.1 million of valuation adjustments relating to our unconsolidated entities and other during the quarter.  Turning to Financial Services. We generated operating earnings of $1.2 million versus a $900,000 loss last year. Mortgage pretax income was $3.4 million versus $2.9 million in the prior year.  During the quarter, FICO scores have remained relatively constant in the low 700s, and we're still seeing about 60% of our buyers using FHA-insured loans. Our title company had a $1.7 million loss during the quarter. That compares with a $3.4 million loss in the prior year. And our Rialto segment generated operating earnings of $11 million. This is net of $12 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. As a reminder, we consolidate the FDIC portfolios and therefore, our results reflect all the activity from the FDIC entities, with an offset attributable to noncontrolling interest.  In order to simplify our Rialto results, I'll once again provide a summary of the $11 million of operating earnings by type of investment as follows: $9.3 million of earnings were generated from our 40% share of FDIC portfolios, plus $4.9 million from the non-FDIC portfolios acquired during the fourth quarter of 2010, $4.6 million of earnings from the PPIP, less approximately $7.8 million of G&A and other expenses. The $9.3 million of earnings from the FDIC portfolios this quarter is primarily from accretable interest income, which is based on the expected cash flows from loan payoffs and interest income and from gains upon foreclosure of REO assets.  The $4.9 million of income generated from the non-FDIC portfolios is derived from both accretable interest income and the sale of REO and gains from foreclosure. The $4.6 million of earnings during the quarter from our investment in PPIP is reported as equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. $2.8 million of this income is interest income, and $1.8 million is due to unrealized gains.  G&A expenses were $7.8 million. However, we earned approximately $4.1 million in gross management fees that were in the performance of the aforementioned investments. We had a $2.4 million tax benefit during the quarter due to favorable resolution of certain tax issues, and we continue to reduce our deferred tax asset and increase shareholders equity as we generate profits. The deferred tax asset reserve at the end of the first quarter was now reduced to $601 million. Our diluted share count for the EPS calculation was 195 million shares and the convertible interest add back for the first quarter was $871,000.  In the first quarter, we continued to maintain balance sheet strength while investing in new strategic opportunities. Our liquidity remained strong. Our leverage remained low. Homebuilding debt-to-total capital net of the $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet at quarter end was 44.5%. We reduced the number of unconsolidated joint ventures to 38%, of which only 14% have recourse debt and that totals a maximum recourse debt of $179 million at the end of the first quarter. We invested $158 million in new well located communities across the country, totaling approximately 2,400 homesites. Inventory increased approximately $145 million sequentially to $3.9 billion, and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. There were 91,000 homesites owned and 17,000 controlled at quarter end, totaling 108,000. And we ended the quarter with approximately two completed unsold homes per community. We added approximately 56 new communities during the quarter and closed out 44 for a net increase of 12 from the fourth quarter. We now have 452 active communities at the end of the quarter. In conclusion, our team of associates are working hard in all areas of the company, and we remain confident that 2011 will be another profitable year.  With that, we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Mr. Jade Rahmani, KBW.
Jade Rahmani: I appreciate the color on Rialto. I just wanted to ask, the loan portfolios that you mentioned you acquired recently, they're in the $100 million to $200 million range, is this the size of typical deals that you're looking at, or are there as many large portfolios hitting the market?
Stuart Miller: No. They are of various sizes. It just so happens that we've had some smaller portfolios that we've been able to nail down a little bit earlier. We are actually working on some larger portfolios at the same time. And it will be interesting to see, but we think that there will be some large ones out there that do trade.
Jade Rahmani: Great, and then can you just broadly characterize the investment pipeline and competitive landscapes? Have you seen pricing become more difficult? And also if you could just comment on the increase in underlying operating expenses, which I think you indicated related to underwriting fees.
Stuart Miller: Yes. I think that the pipeline is very active right now. I don't think that prices are out of control at all. I don't think that prices are being bid up. There are actually fewer competitors today than there were a year ago for portfolios. And we think that there's going to be a lot more out there as banks and the FDIC continue to sell off assets that need to be resolved. In terms of the underlying operating expenses, we're seeing very strong operating leverage. The most expensive part of building an organization is what happens in the beginning. As we add new portfolios, the SG&A associated with new portfolios is materially lower than it was in the beginning, and we think we'll continue to see strong profitability derived from that in the future.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan.
Jason Marcus: This is actually Jason Marcus in for Mike. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the month-to-month trends during the quarter regarding pricing and pace, and perhaps if maybe you can give us an early read on what March looked like.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Rick?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, I guess talking about March first versus the quarter, we generally don't like to give intra-quarter guidance. But given that that’s what everybody focuses, I can say that pretty much across the board, the March to date numbers are better than what we recorded with regard to orders growth for last quarter. We saw a pickup in activity sequentially from December, January, February and that was pretty much across all markets.
Jason Marcus: Okay. And then on the next question is just of the land purchases you did during the quarter, did any of that come to Rialto and if so, how much?
Richard Beckwitt: There were few communities that came in sourced by Rialto that were then closed on the Homebuilding side. I would tell you that of the 56 new gross communities that we did during the quarter, probably about 15% where sourced by Rialto.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg: First question, Stuart, in your speech, you talked about reigniting Everything's Included, and I wonder if you could give us more details about what kind of things you’re putting in the house? Or when you can [ph], what kind of things you're putting in the house now that you weren't before? Has there been some sort of shift in what buyers are paying for or is that maybe you're decontenting the house a little bit? Can you give us some more color on it?
Stuart Miller: Well, David, at the core of Everything's Included is market research and understanding exactly what people are looking for. And by necessity, the answer to that question is it's going to be different for every market and every submarket. So our operating teams go out, research in each market what the appetites are in that local market and what people are looking for. What we try to do is include in the home the things that people would choose if they had the right -- if they were making choices on their own. And in doing so, by having those things included, we're pricing them into the home, pricing them into all of the homes and making the construction process a lot easier. But the specific answer to your question is that it varies from market to market. And the appetites of local customers are going to determine which specific items go into the home.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon. I would add to that, sort of specifically, some items we're seeing across all markets are items that focus on technology and on energy efficiency. And in that regard, we work with some of our larger vendors to -- once we identify through our market research what our consumers are interested in, work on packaging and on cost efficiency in delivering the products that they want at a great value.
David Goldberg - UBS: Great, and then my follow-up question was you guys give incentives as a percent of home price. And I guess it’s a little bit back when looking with new month deliveries, when you look at what’s in the backlog now and kind of as you're selling through, as you were selling through the quarter, were you finding that you were offering more incentives or is that firming up pretty nicely?
Stuart Miller: Actually the trendline on incentives has been going down into the month. And it really has followed that path sequentially through last quarter as well.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ken Zener, KeyBanc.
Kenneth Zener: I wonder, Stuart, if you could comment on the sustainably of gross margins at 21% x charges, that are already running above your historic average similar to 1998 and 2000, which is very impressive obviously, given all the known headwinds that exist as well as kind of the outlook or sequential outlook for the year, given your comments perhaps around improving absorption pace.
Stuart Miller: Let me let Rick and Jon take that one.
Jonathan Jaffe: This is Jon. It's what we focus on everyday in the field, Rick and I, with the Regional Presidents and Division Presidents, and as you know, constant balance between maintaining margin and achieving an absorption that allows us to manage to a profitable level given our G&A. As you know, there's clearly some headwinds in terms of that velocity as well as cost pressures. And what we do is we battle everyday on the cost side, both in terms of land acquisition, land development and direct cost to maintain that margin. And there’s just going to continue to be that kind of day-to-day battle as we move forward until we have some pricing power.
Kenneth Zener: Right, so it sounds as though you've -- I mean, it’s a day-to-day battle but does it strike you as odd that given all these headwinds, you're at such a high level? Obviously, Bruce commented on new communities and new lots contributing to that and some builders think that, that land is of a limited supply. Just to get a better clarity around that as well as your units under construction.
Stuart Miller: Look, that land is at limited supply, but I think that we've been able to source new land opportunities that have enabled us to continue to maintain our margin and have really given us an advantage. Will it be sustainable going forward with the headwinds surrounding volume and pricing? Look, there's clearly some pressure out there. But as Jon said, it's what we do everyday. We focus on maintaining that gross margin by buying the next community at the right price, by managing our cost structure and making sure that we're driving our gross margin to the highest level possible.
Operator: The next question is coming from the Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities: This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. I wanted to see if you could clarify your comments about March. Did you say that it was up month-over-month on a kind of normal basis, a little better than planned? How does that compare to previous years?
Richard Beckwitt: The level of decline year-over-year is less than the last quarter.
Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay, and then your order rate during the quarter, how did that compare to your internal budget expectations at the outset, were they above plan, below? In general, just how would you say the spring selling season is shaping up compared to your original expectations?
Richard Beckwitt: We were relatively close to plan for the quarter. We had some divisions that exceeded plan. We had some that met plan and some that fell short.
Jonathan Jaffe: I think as Rick said, the quarter was sort of sequential. December as I think you all know from what's been reported in the news was an extremely difficult month and that was the beginning of our quarter. And so as we move through January and February, we did see some stabilization improvement compared to the beginning of the quarter.
Operator: The next question is coming from Dan Oppenheimer, Crédit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim: Just wondering if you can talk about Texas to start [ph]. Was there any theme in terms of some of the volumes there, whether it's on tougher FHA lending that's been more difficult for volume, competition from others who have been aiming for volume? Anything you can comment on that would be great.
Richard Beckwitt: Texas continues to be a tough market to operate in. Competition there is fierce. Credit challenged buyers are an issue. And we're working hand-in-hand with the mortgage company to get people qualified. It was sort of a mixed bag throughout Texas. There were parts of Texas that actually showed some year-over-year growth. But our largest market, Houston, was off. What we can say is that we've seen some pricing stabilization in the market, and we've had some recent success in working with credit-challenged buyers.
Daniel Oppenheim: Great. And then second question, wondering about costs. You talked about introducing new product and about using that to go back and lower costs and talked about seeing down 25%? I imagine that’s sort of from some time ago. So thinking about costs in 2011 versus 2010, where would you say we are in that right now?
Richard Beckwitt: On the cost side, the biggest drivers right now are lumber pricing increases and a little bit of pressure on copper. We've seen some downward revisions or downward adjustments in some of the other materials. Net-net, we're probably running $200, $300, $400 a home higher in material costs than where we were last quarter. The unknown is are there going to be any increases in delivery costs with the rise in gasoline prices. But on a net basis, we've done such a tremendous job in working with the trades on efficiency of process and cycle time to eliminate their downtime at the site that we think that we’ll be able to really offset those things, and they should be modest.
Operator: The next question is coming from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates: Jon, just to elaborate on your comment on December, recognizing that you closed your year-end 2010 with a very strong surprising order trend for the quarter, is it possible that December fell off because you pulled forward some demand? Because it sounds like from commentary that January and February kind of bounced back and you continue to see that and you also -- I think Bruce commented that your incentives declined sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter as a percent of average selling price. So I guess I'm feeling like you guys are more bearish than what your numbers are telling us, and maybe you can help clarify.
Jonathan Jaffe: It may have been a little bit pulled forward, but I think that's pretty consistent with what you saw other builders report and market research companies report. December was pretty flat, Ivy, and it just felt a little bit better as we moved past the new year. But I think Stuart said in his general comments, it remains very soft out there. And from market to market we see different things happening. Some markets feel a little bit better, and you can definitely see some stabilization. Other markets remain very choppy.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates: Can you, just to follow-up, go through sort of the best performers within the larger markets like within Florida versus California, we already hit Texas or where really the weakest links are versus your strongest top markets, please?
Jonathan Jaffe: I'd say the weakest links are sort of the southwest if you look at the Phoenix, Vegas markets, very soft demand and very competitive. As Rick mentioned, Texas, particularly because of the big focus on first-time buyers, is very difficult. If you look in California, I would say Orange County, San Diego is the strongest performer. But that's just a stable market as compared to say Central Valley and Sacramento, which remain extremely weak. And then on the East Coast, if you look at the mid-Atlantic area up to D.C., probably some of the strongest markets in the country.
Richard Beckwitt: Florida was up in the quarter for us. I think some of that, Ivy, is due to more to the communities that we've got, the submarkets within markets. And we're benefiting from some of those strategic deals that we put together. But net up in the quarter...
Ivy Zelman - Zelman and Associates: Rick, can you just stay within Florida, break down Florida a little bit further?
Richard Beckwitt: Within Florida, probably that central area is the softest part of Florida, sort of Tampa, Orlando. And southwest, if you're in the right location in that Naples, Sarasota, part of that curve of the communities that we've got, the big master plan, those are doing fine. Southeast Florida is fine if you're in the right place.
Jonathan Jaffe: It’s interesting, Ivy, if you look at the Mid-West, Colorado remains soft and Minnesota seems pretty healthy.
Operator: The next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo.
Adam Rudiger - Wachovia Capital Markets: Just a question for Bruce. I want to make sure I understand some of the Rialto earnings correctly. The $13 million in REO gains that you mentioned, is that simply you acquiring REO and then adjusting what you think it's worth, or are there actual realized gains in there?
B. Gross: So the $13 million that you see in our press release, that's primarily gains on foreclosure of assets. So we have loans that as they go to foreclosure and they become REO, we have the fair value of the assets on our books. And because we purchase these portfolios wholesale, big discounts, when we fair value, we've so far been recognizing income as we fair value those assets, as they’re foreclosed. Now keep in mind, that $13 million, because we consolidate the FDIC portfolio, that's 100% of FDIC number, then we back out 60% in noncontrollable interest, so the real number is really 40% of that $13 million.
Operator: The next question is coming from Josh Levin of Citi.
Josh Levin: Stuart, during your prepared remarks, I think you said that there was a pressure on pricing, but then you guys have also been talking about incentives getting better month-over-month. So if can you help reconcile the two comments?
Stuart Miller: Jon or Rick, why don't you go ahead.
Richard Beckwitt: Well, pressure on pricing is the pressure of the competition out there. We're subject to what other homebuilders are selling their homes for. And we're trying to maximize the value for the homes and working to get appraisal values up because that's the thing -- that's the headwind in us being able to nudge prices up month-to-month to month-to-month because you're dealing with some stale comps out there. As far as incentives, what we found through some marketing and some strategic things that we're doing in our sales centers that through the packaging that we've done with our Everything's Included product, we've been able to decrease the incentives that we've had to do in order to get people to sign the contract. So it's really not an inconsistent statement. We're dealing with pricing pressure in the market, but I think that our product is positioned well in the market to maximize value.
Josh Levin: Okay, and one more question, you sort of suggested that spring has been of a disappointment in terms of sales but how has traffic been relative to your expectations?
Richard Beckwitt: Traffic's been mixed. We have gained an increase in the number of people coming through the communities clearly since the December, January time frame. You'd expect that with that being the time of the year. And the number of people coming through are not just looking. They want to buy a home. As Stuart said in his remarks earlier, that the biggest issue we have is getting them qualified. But traffic is up. We'd like to see more people. So if anyone's looking for a home, come to our sites.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jonathan Ellis, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jonathan Ellis: First question is just on specs. Bruce, I don't know if you have handy the total number of unsold homes under construction. I know you gave the finished spec number. And then the second part of that question is, if my math's correct, your finished specs pretty much remained flat over the last few quarters. Just given that your commentary regarding the choppiness you've seen thus far, I might have thought that the finished spec count would have been worked down, you wouldn't be having as many new specs coming online and given that vis-à-vis your cancellation rate came down, so it doesn't look like cancellations really drove a lot of incremental spec, finished spec, in the quarter. So maybe just help us understand what your sort of spec strategy is in the coming quarters.
B. Gross: I'm going to give you the number, and then Rick will add on to this. So the unsold homes under construction are just under 2,000 for the quarter.
Richard Beckwitt: As far as spec strategy, I wouldn't be alarmed by the flat level of specs versus prior quarters. Given the fact that we’ve started up operations in a lot of new communities over the last couple of quarters, we want to get some product on the ground in order to deliver. And if you look at just the last quarter, we had about, I don't know, 10%, 12% of our total community universe where new communities that were added during the quarter on a gross basis. So it's really just product placement within new operations to get them going.
Jonathan Ellis: That's helpful, thank you. And then my second question is just on the land side. Again, if my numbers are correct, the average price per homesite this quarter was somewhat higher than what you've been paying over the last year or so. Is that just a function of geographic mix, or are there any other factors you should consider in the types of lots that were buying quarter? And then just broadly speaking, if you could talk about lot availability, willingness of banks to bring supply to market?
B. Gross: Let me take the first part of that question. You're right, $158 million and that got us 2,400 homesites. It also got us a couple of hundred acres, which I didn't mention. But the location was different. There was less in Texas and there were more in some of the coastal markets. We feel really good about the acquisitions that we made during the quarter. And we think as those communities open up, we will continue to see higher than company average margins as we work through those communities. So that's purely a function of geography.
Richard Beckwitt: And on the deal flow side, we continue to see -- actually not see, go find and seek out decent opportunities, given the hand-in-hand relationship that we have with Rialto, we've got doors open at places where not a lot of other folks are shopping. Some of the low hanging fruit in the brokerage deals has been chewed through. But we still see a pipeline of opportunity out there that we're pursuing.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen East, Ticonderoga Securities.
Stephen East: If we could look at the cash, Bruce, you talked a little bit about land spend, $158 million. It looks like you used about $200 million in total. Could you explain the big buckets of where that's going, because I assume it looks like some of it went to Rialto.
B. Gross: Sure, only about $11 million went to Rialto this quarter, and that would have been our contribution or actual cash payment into the fund during the quarter. Most of it is land acquisition and development. And additionally, in our fourth quarter, as we went through the downturn and we tendered for some debt and we issued some new debt, it turns out that the December 1 payment that we make on our interest tends to be the highest of the year. So the interest payments during the quarter were higher than you'll see in our first and third quarters. So second and fourth quarters have higher interest payments than the first and third. And that's pretty much all of the difference.
Stephen East: Okay, how much did you -- when you said the land, $158 million, did that include the development costs as well, then?
B. Gross: No, it did not.
Stephen East: Roughly how much was that?
B. Gross: I could circle back with you. I have to look up that number, Steve.
Stephen East: Sure, no problem. And then the other question I had is if you look forward based on what Stuart was saying, a lot of gives and takes in the market on the pricing pressure and the costs, et cetera, your gross margin that you have in backlog and as you're looking out, is it comparable to what we're seeing now? And then the SG&A, do you think that's -- you're at the right level that you need right now or does more costs have to come out of it?
Richard Beckwitt: On the gross margin side, I believe that’s close to that 20% number whether it's up 1% or down 1%, that's the zip code that we're operating in right now. And if we get a little bit of back wind or tailwind, we'll be able to push that number. And I think that's probably too big a range for you. But it's right around that 20% number is I think a decent number. On SG&A, Stephen, we're running pretty lean. We wanted to deliver more homes in the quarter than we did. I think sequentially through the year that, that percentage should go down. And I think that we're comfortable. If we need to make more cuts, we'll make more cuts.
Operator: The last question is coming from Joshua Pollard, Goldman Sachs.
Joshua Pollard: My first one is around your commentary from the prepared comments. You talked about the second half being better. My question is whether you expect the second half to be better from a sales perspective because the comps get easier year-on-year, or do you expect an acceleration in growth relative to what you guys are seeing so far in this first half?
Stuart Miller: Well, Josh, we keep our view pretty tight to where the market is right now. We don't try to look out too far and make predictions about where the market is going to be and how it might reconcile. The comment that I was really making is that comps in the first half of the year are going to be pretty tough because you're comparing to the accelerated sales, the pull forward of sales, that related to the tax credit that was in place last year. And that will probably be, I would say, through April, May. And then as you go to the back half of the year, the sales that were pulled forward resulted in a later sales pace at the back end of the year. So the comparisons should be better. And as soft as a data point as this is, I think it is relevant that people start to see comparisons that are favorable and they start to get a little bit of confidence about the housing market in general. And that reflects positively on the market overall. So my comment was really more about the comparisons and the fact that we'll probably get some more positive data points as we get to the second half of the year. It was less a comment about sales pace picking up in the back half of the year.
Joshua Pollard: Got it, and I guess my final question is one around your backlog burn rate. I'm trying to understand if $120 million or above $100 is where you guys plan to run your business long term. And ultimately I'd love to know what your cycle times are in order for you guys to get there. And I'm wondering whether or not you guys are concerned at all about what your backlog may look like, keeping up at 120 or 100%-plus type of pace as we continue through a rather sluggish sales environment.
Richard Beckwitt: On the percentage of backlog in a perfect world, we'd like to presell everything, Josh, but that's not this market today. People want to see what home they're getting so they can feel like they're negotiating for value and that -- so as the market shifts to a normalized market where you get a higher level of pre-sales, you'll see that backlog conversion rate come down on a percentage basis just by definition.
Joshua Pollard: So are you guys pre-building a certain number of these homes up to some point, and that's what's allowing you to be able to convert so quickly? Is there something different about the way you're running your building operation that's allowing you to get this high level of backlog conversion rate? Or are you guys just building homes in 60 days?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, a lot of it is by definition is the results of the EI business model that we've got. We don't have to tinker around with trying to backfill an option request for a customer coming in the door. So from an efficiency standpoint, we can build them pretty quick. As Bruce noted earlier, we do have one to two finished homes in each community that when they sell, they close quick. So you're seeing a backlog that is extremely fresh. And by definition of that, we can deliver it pretty quick.
Stuart Miller: All right. And just to that point, let me say the benefits of our EI program are really, really strong in a lot of different areas. It's not only a value proposition and an ability to get our costs down, it also enables us to really enhance our cycle time and run an efficient business.  With that said, let me just conclude by saying that we are really pleased with our overall operating strategy as we sit right now in current market conditions. The market is soft, and these are tough times. From an operating strategy standpoint, our Homebuilding operations are lean, well positioned to remain profitable, as we go through these tough times. And our performance is augmented by our Rialto program, which is really hitting stride right now.  On the Rialto side, we are seeing numerous opportunities to make distress purchases. We think that those opportunities will get bigger and more plentiful as we go forward. We think that both the Homebuilding and the Rialto purchases will be benefited when the market turns around and starts to recover. So overall, we like the position that we're in right now with strong Homebuilding operations and a complementary Rialto program.  We look forward to reporting to you on our progress as we go forward. Thanks for listening.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Stuart Miller: Good morning. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter and 2010 year-end update. We're very pleased to announce our fourth quarter and year-end results. 2010 marks a very solid year of performance for our company against the backdrop of a very difficult, economic and homebuilding environment. I'm joined this morning, as always, by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer, Rick Beckwitt, our Executive Vice President and Jeff Krasnoff, Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment are here and will be participating in our question-and-answer period. I'm going to begin with some opening brief remarks about the current housing market in general and the progress that we've made on managing our business. And Bruce will provide additional detail on our numbers. And then, of course, we're going to open the phones to your questions. As always, I'd like to ask that in our Q&A period, everybody please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of the participants. Okay. Our fourth quarter marks the end of what has been a complicated and difficult year in the housing market in general. The year started with signs of stabilization and high hopes that the stimulus plan of a tax credit together with historically low interest rates would help form a foundation on which the housing market might form a comeback. Unfortunately, as the tax credit expired it became clear that it had only pulled existing demand forward and the housing market slumped back into recession under the weight of shadow inventory and foreclosures. Low interest rate to loan were not enough to sustain higher demand levels and overcome high unemployment, lower consumer confidence and the customer’s general inability to secure down payment funds. The housing recession/depression that started some five years ago has left an indelible mark on the landscape of the housing market that will be with us for some time to come. We continue to believe that the housing recovery will traverse a long and bumpy road that will be inconsistent and uneven from submarket to submarket. Shadow inventory and foreclosures will continue to impact individual markets on the supply side while the pace of recovery in the job market will influence consumer confidence and demand. We've some early signs of gradual stabilization in the market. MLS listings have declined in many of our markets and the foreclosure pipeline is measured by delinquency rates have trended down. Against this rather difficult backdrop, we are very pleased that our Fourth quarter and year-end results represent a continuation of Lennar's return to profitability and represents solid operating performance in all areas of our company, even while market conditions have not improved. Overall, net earnings were $32 million or $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter and $95 million or $0.51 per share for the year. All three segments, Homebuilding, Financial Services and Rialto, contributed to the company's profitability, and we continue to look to overall profitability for the full year of 2011. Perhaps most importantly, asides from our return to profitability we had many significant operating accomplishments in 2010 that will afford us significant operating leverage when market conditions do ultimately begin to improve. On the Homebuilding side, 2010 has been a year of basic blocking and tackling as we focused on maximizing operational efficiency in order to achieve profitability even in depressed market conditions. In every one of our divisions, we've created a new product that is desirable to today's market, while offering fewer plans and redesigning efficient plans that allow us to minimize cost. We have used this efficient design as a foundation to renegotiate cost and reduce our direct cost by an average of 25%, enabling us to achieve appropriate gross margins. While some of these costs will rise as demand returns and will be passed on through price increases many of the cost efficiencies that have been incorporated will benefit our ongoing cost structure permanently. (Inaudible) times continue to come down due to our new more efficient product. We have simply never run more efficiently in the filed on both the building and the purchasing side of our business and given the very limited volume of construction nationally, our supply chain continues to work with us to lower our per foot building costs. As the same time we've maintained inventory levels in our communities that well balance with completed specs remaining about one to two per community. We are keeping our construction process Additionally, we've reignited our Everything's Included marketing platform in order to ensure that Lennar Homes always offer the very best value proposition in any of our markets. Lennar's Everything’s Included platform has always delivered the best value in our market by targeting the options and upgrades that are most desirable to our customers and including in the Home offering while eliminating options and upgrades and the overhead associated with them. We've also right sized our operations. We've reduced our SG&A in each of our operating divisions so that we are sized with appropriate personnel to operate profitably at today's depressed volumes while maintaining our most talented associates who will be able to help drive even greater earnings as market conditions do improve. We are sized to be able to make money today and to drive greater profits as the markets move forward. Finally and perhaps most importantly we've continued to purchase new strategic communities in the very best locations and sub market and have used these community purchases to help drive gross margin higher. We've been very selective to purchase only those communities that will drive our gross margins and we've avoided the competitive bids that have resulted in driving land prices higher. We have used our Rialto point of entry as an opportunity to access sellers and find and negotiate for land that is not yet on the market. Overall, 2010 has been an excellent year of repositioning for our homebuilding operations and we're well positioned to drive our bottom line when market conditions stabilize and improve. In addition to our accomplishments in Homebuilding in 2010, we also successfully completed the creation and launch of our new business segment, Rialto. While we began the process of preparing the launch of this business segment some three years ago, 2010 saw the investment of approximately $500 million in various assets that would utilize the Rialto machine. Rialto immediately began returning profits from those investments and is very well positioned to continue to invest capital and generate outsized returns on that invested capital. In our Rialto segment we purchased large and small portfolios of loans and REO at wholesale prices and then worked through those assets one at a time to resolve at retail payoff. It's all about making money by managing the process of purchasing wholesale and selling retail. Purchasing in bulk, selling one at a time. And admittedly the assets are a little bit more complex but this is where we are experts. The major contributors to Rialto's $12.4 million of operating earnings in the fourth quarter are our share of the profits from distressed real estate portfolio transactions, our public-private investment fund activities with Alliance Bernstein and the Department of Treasury or PPIP and the fees that we received from others for our management of these investments. As indicated in our press released we had a busy quarter adding to the distressed investments portfolio with the acquisition of approximately $740 million of real estate assets from three larger financial institutions. The combined portfolios added almost 400 loans to the over 5,500 we had previously acquired in partnership with the FDIC. All totaled during fiscal 2010 we acquired loans welcome to the an unpaid balance of approximately $3.6 billion as well as over 300 real estate properties that the sellers had appraised at over $200 million. With unpaid accrued and default interest and other amounts due from borrowers, the total is approximately $4.5 billion that we acquired for approximately $1(inaudible) billion or $0.33 on the dollar. And our net investment equaled approximately $430 million after accounting for seller financing and the FDIC's equity interest in our first two portfolios. We also completed the first closing of Rialto Real Estate funds with investors committing approximately $300 million, of which $75 million will come from Lennar. The fund objective is to invest in distressed real estate assets and other related investments similar to what we have already been doing. And just a couple of weeks ago, actually New Year's Eve, we closed on the funds first investment of $34 million portfolio of non-performing loans. On the Operations side, we continue to build an outstanding team of professionals at Rialto on our strong base of already familiar faces. Our detailed due diligence reviews combined with our resolution process and real estate operating capabilities allow us to look at these portfolios on a wholesale basis and do our operations bring value to individual assets on a retail basis. The Rialto team has now well over 110 associates focused on portfolio operations that include loan workout, property asset management, servicing finance, and back office operations in our three main offices in Miami, Atlanta and New York, along with a growing number of satellite offices located in Lennar's Homebuilding offices such as Southern California, Phoenix and Las Vegas. Our disciplined loan workout and resolution process, were initially designed almost two decades ago to maximize proceeds and returns from distressed assets. In our weekly asset manager meetings, our team methodically and professionally approaches and deals with the underlying borrowers and tees-up many of the resolutions that have to-date exceeded our initial underwritings. We are now deep into all of our 2010 portfolios having had contact with borrowers representing over 90% of the combined outstanding loan balances and in our first two transactions with the FDIC for which we took over management some nine months ago, we have not fully resolved over 240 assets and have brought in over $190 million in cash with our team, achieving an average resolution of some $0.90 on the dollar, although it's still early in the game. Over half of these resolved assets have been at levels at or higher than the full outstanding amount of principal due on the loan because we have been able to collect past due accrued interest and late fees. We now have over $175 million of cash on the partnership balance sheet. Over $120 million of this is earmarked to the fees the original $627 million of acquisition financing. And the rest is available as working capital to help us maximize the resolution of the remaining assets. We believe that our team and the infrastructure we have in place today is already way ahead of the pack and is setting the standard for best practices in the industry. This has positioned us extremely well for a growing pipeline of opportunity from the FDIC, from Banks and from others. Our due diligence team has been evaluating billions of dollars of potential opportunities. But our team distinguishes itself because it is made up of already in-place managers who are today working out loans and dealing with similar underlying collateral in the same markets and in a number of cases, the same borrowers. If we are able to purchase assets at our pricing and we believe we will, we are positioned to quickly and efficiently bring those assets right into our already in place work out machine and maximize bottom line profitability. And because of the high percentage of loans made to developers being able to efficiently incorporate Lennar's Homebuilding unique view and expertise gives this segment another distinct advantage in our evaluation and maximization of value for the assets. As a company we've remained very excited about our Rialto position and our marketplace and we look forward to reporting to you on the progress in future quarters. Overall, in the context of a very difficult market, we are very pleased with the progress we've been able to make, as reflected in our fourth quarter and our year-end 2010 results. And more importantly, we're very excited about the general direction of our company's strategy. Homebuilding and Financial Services remain positioned to be profitable in today's uncertain times and to drive materially improved profitability as the market stabilizes and ultimately begins to recover. At the same time, our Rialto strategy is building momentum in this distressed environment, as it grows both new and exciting opportunities to invest company capital and as well, produce real bottom line profitability. Our people continue to be a bright spot in the company. The dedication and focus in all parts of our company are a true source of pride. From the execution of business plans in the field to the cooperative spirit that exists between the Lennar Homebuilding segment and the Rialto segment of our company in sourcing new business opportunities, our people are really making the difference. More importantly our in place management team and overall staffing are positioned to drive real operating leverage as market conditions continue to improve and they will. With the people now in place we are positioned to be able to drive substantially more Homebuilding volume and substantially more Rialto investments without adding overhead. While we remain cautious about the immediate future we do believe that we have properly positioned the company to succeed in the current environment and to excel when the market recovers. We will continue to make strategic and opportunistic investments and focus on every aspect of cost structure as we look forward to a profitable 2011. Thank you.
Bruce Gross: Thank you, Stuart. And good morning. This was another quarter of positive operating earning contributions from all three of our business segments. Our Homebuilding business segment improvement significantly, as noted by operating earnings of $27 million this quarter, compared to a loss of $277 million last year. Revenue from home sales decreased 13% to $726 million, due to a 12% decrease in home deliveries, excluding joint ventures. While the company's average sales price was flat year-over-year at $238,000, the regional average sales prices were also relatively flat, except for our Houston Homebuilding segment where the average sales prices increased 9% year-over-year. Our premium impaired gross margin improved to 20.8% versus 17.8% in the prior year. Gross margins were strongest in our East Region this quarter and the improvement in gross margin is due to a combination of deliveries from new communities with higher gross margins, continued focus on controlling cost and a reduction in sales incentives on homes closed. Sales incentives declined from 36,300 per home to 33,700 per home during the quarter. And this is a reduction from 13.2% of home sales to 12.4% of home sales. As we indicated on our third quarter conference call we expected that the fourth quarter would have approximately $2,000 to $5,000 sequential increase in sales incentives and the actual increase was approximately $3,100 per home. Homebuilding community impairment decreased to 22.3 million compared to 55.5 million in the prior year. And the impairments during the quarter were primarily a result of a strategy to reduce prices and increase absorption in several communities. Our selling general and administration expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales was 14.1% and that was a 210 basis point improvement from the prior year. The improvement continues to be primarily in the areas of lower expenses in legal, personnel and occupancy categories. Our improved gross margins and reduced SG&A led to another quarter of improved operating margins, increasing 510 basis points from the prior year to 6.7%, which is (inaudible) impairment. Gross profits on land sales totaled $13.7 million and that was primarily due to the recognition of deferred revenue related to a profit participation agreement. Our Financial Services business segment generated operating earnings of $11.7 million. And that is compared to $7.8 million profit from the prior year. This is primarily due to higher volume in profits per loan in our mortgage operations. Mortgage pretax income was $11.1 million versus $7.9 million in the prior year. And many of you have been asking about our mortgage putbacks exposure, which we have indicated is not material. At the end of the fiscal 2010, our reserve for mortgage putbacks settlements was $9.9 million and that compares to $9.5 million in the prior year. Out title company was profitable. It earned $1 million profit versus $2.3 million in the prior year. Our Rialto business segment also generated operating earnings, as Stuart mentioned totaling $12.4 million. And this number is net of $12.7 million of net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. As a reminder we consolidated the FDIC portfolios and therefore our results reflect all the activity from the FDIC entities with an offset attributable to non-controlling interests. I'd like to simplify Rialto results for you so I'm going to give you a summary of Rialto’s $12.4 million of operating earnings by type of investment. There was $10.6 million of earnings generated from our 40% share of FDIC portfolios during the quarter. $7.4 million relating to PPIP, $3 million relating to the bank loan portfolios acquired during the fourth quarter and then there was approximately $8.6 million of G&A and other expenses. The $10.6 million of earnings from the FDIC portfolios includes income from first accretable income based on the expected cash flows from loan payoffs and interest income. Second, gains from sales of real estate owned. Third, gains upon foreclosure of real estate owned where an asset is foreclosed upon there is a fear of value performed on the asset, which can result in a gain or loss. And then fourth, fees for managing the FDIC entity. G&A expenses were $8.6 million; however we earned approximately $4.2 million in gross management fees that were in the performance of the aforementioned investments. The $3 million of income generated from the bank loan portfolios is primarily from accretable interest income and the $7.4 million of earnings during the quarter from our investment in PPIP is reported as equity and earnings from unconsolidated entities. $2.7 million of this income is interest income and $4.7 million is due to unrealized gains. The G&A and other expenses in the Rialto segment include G&A costs and expensed underwriting costs for new opportunities. Corporate G&A expenses were reduced by $7.7 million in the quarter or 24% versus the prior year, as a result of our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives. We were successful in finding another opportunity to recover funds related to Chinese drywall as we utilized the 10-year product liability carryback, which is included in this quarters tax benefit. In the fourth quarter, we continued to maintain balance sheet strength while investing in new strategic opportunities. Our liquidity is strong. Our leverage remains low, as our homebuilding debt-to-total capital net of the $1.2 billion of cash was 44.2% in the fourth quarter. Shareholders’ equity increased to $2.6 billion during the quarter. And our leverage ratio will improve further upon the full reversal of the $609 million deferred tax asset, which we still expect will occur in 2011. Additionally we retired approximately $109 million of Lennar debt during the quarter and issue $446 million in a new senior convertible debt offering during the quarter which has 2.75% coupon and 40% conversion premium. We replaced our cash collateralized letter of credit facility with a $150 million three year unsecured LT facility with five banks. This released approximately $150 million of cash that can now be put to work in new investment opportunities. We continued our success of reducing our joint ventures. This quarter was reduced by six and unconsolidated JV's are now 42 and only 14 of those have recourse debt. Additionally, we reduced our maximum recourse indebtedness to $173 million at the end of the fourth quarter and the remaining unconsolidated JVs with debt are conservatively financed, with an aggregate net debt-to-total-capital of 36%. Our inventory is well positioned as we enter 2011. We invested $84 million in new well-located communities in the quarter, totaling approximately 2,500 home sites. Inventory decreased approximately $100 million sequentially to $3.7 billion, and that excludes consolidated inventory not owned. There were 84,000 home sites owned. 20,000 controlled, totaling 104,000 at the end of the quarter. We ended the quarter with approximately 1,000 completed unsold homes and with 440 active communities at the end of the quarter it's just a little above two per community. We started 1,800 homes during the quarter and we entered fiscal 2010 expecting to return to profitability for the year. We completed 2010 earning $95 million of net income for the year. Similar to 2010 we expect profitability in our first quarter of 2011 to be challenged based on a low volume of projected (inaudible) deliveries. However, we are confident that 2011 will be another profitable year. Let me turn over for Q&A now.
Operator: We will now begin our formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Ivy Zelman: Thanks. Good morning guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. My first question pertains to your new communities with respect to going forward. You entered the year at 440 active communities. Recognizing you might not have a definitive number, but do you expect it to be north of 10% growth in communities? And within the communities that you did operate in the fourth quarter, what percent of the closings or orders, however you want to frame it Bruce, came from new acquired lots at the distressed prices that would obviously be higher margin roughly? That's the first question. I do get a follow-up.
Bruce Gross: Let me answer the deliveries in the fourth quarter. We took a look at that and about 10% of the deliveries came from some of the new communities acquired over the last four to six quarters. And relative to the community count, we ended at 440 for the year and maybe Jon you want to take where we're headed as far as communities?
Jon Jaffe: Well, if you look at the last quarter Ivy, we probably brought around 29 communities during the quarter. Not all of them are open yet in traditional community count but those are basically the deals that we did as a company coast to coast. I think that it's going to depend on the quality of the deal; our underwriting standards are extremely tight today. As we've said in the past we don't incorporate any inflation or underwriting needs to the north of the 20% gross margin and 20% IRR and targeting about a 10% pre-tax. So every deal will be added. I think it will be safe to assume that we're probably going to add another 10% to 15% in '011.
Bruce Gross: Let me just add Ivy and say that as we look at the communities that we've brought on and the ones that are coming on, all of our new communities are in fact accreted to our gross margin. We're seeing some real positive impact from some of the communities that are being brought on, even though our existing communities are faring pretty well as well.
Ivy Zelman: That's great news. I guess just a follow-up question relating to the underlying demand and looking at your fourth quarter with you permanently reducing your cost structure and therefore showing better profitability. Everyone's wondering is it sustainable in an environment in 2011 that arguably could be pretty still tenuous demand on the demand side and recognizing that you did better on orders, and I think the market was looking for and some of your I guess, peers, it looks as though your incentives didn't really see a big increase? So I guess with respect to 2011, if the demand was to remain where it was today at pretty low levels, do you think the sustainability of the margins are there and do you see any bright signs or any traffic underlying demand that might give us some hope? I know that KB Homes indicated they were seeing more stringent underwriting so a little of your thoughts Stuart just on demand and as you mentioned you expect to be profitable in 2011? So that does mean you're not expecting an improvement in demand and holding it at the current levels in order to drive that profitability in '11?
Stuart Miller: Listen I (inaudible) many times. I think it's hard to look past just the months that are ahead of us in the market like this and I think there' some mixed signals out there. We can, as we project and as we look forward we're not anticipating improvement but with that said we are seeing some indicators of some stabilization in the marketplace. That's not to suggest that it is stabilizing and will start to recover because I just don't know. But the indicators that we're seeing and we just had our division presidents meeting that we do on a quarterly basis and in almost every single market, the indicator from the field is that the MLS listings are down. The backlog of foreclosures as indicated by delinquency rates seems to be trending down and these would be good signs for future improvement or at least stabilization. As we're looking at our performance for 2011, we're not anticipating improvement in the marketplace. We think that we can remain profitable with solid gross margins. That doesn't mean they won't be somewhat challenged, if market conditions remain challenging. But we think that we're going to be able to maintain our current profitability through 2011 even at current levels and that's what we've designed our company position to be able to do, is to remain profitable in these conditions even with some negative bias and to really be able to leverage that overhead as we go forward. Let me just say parenthetically that as market positions continue to remain stagnant, this all goes in favor of our Rialto program and affords us even more opportunity to invest in distressed and leverage that operation. So we think that we have a balanced and intelligent program that's positioned for profitability even at current levels with a negative bias and we think any improvement in the marketplace really works well for us.
Rick Beckwitt: One thing I'd add Ivy is with regard to margins specifically. As Bruce shared with you on a current delivery basis the new deals are really not adding a lot to our bottom line and our gross composition and as the year moves forward we're going to get some upside benefit associated with the mix of new communities coming in because they were purchased through very, very attractively. The offset to that we do anticipate as the market improves that there will be some cost increases associated with material costs, and that's something that we can't control. Commodities will move one way or another. The trades are going to try to improve for increased pricing and we're going to have to deal with that and if the market does recover well we'll be able to tack some of that on to the consumer. The things that should maintain with regard to true benefit of the bottom line are all the redesign, reengineering, restructuring things of our base line product that we pulled out really hard costs out of the home from a construction build cost standpoint. So, from a sales standpoint, we're pricing to sell in the market. If the markets at $100,000, that's where that price for that home should be we're going to sell it at that price. We do know how many homes we need to sell in the current community in order to have that community have a pre-tax positive disposition. We look at everything on an individual profit center and margins will move up and down during the year. But we're positioned right now to make money in '11.
Ivy Zelman: Thanks Rick. Just about the underwriting. Any changes that are in the quarter with respect to the mortgage tightening or any comment there please?
Rick Beckwitt: Mortgage underwriting has got a bit tougher but we've seen the underwriting standards get tighter. Bruce, you want to talk about that at all or Jon?
Jon Jaffe: Hi Ivy. It's Jon. We're definitely seeing a difficulty in getting desired buyers qualified through the process. From what we see in the field level this is creating more of a pent up demand. It seems like there is interest in buyers but difficulty getting them actually approved in the closing table. I'd say.
Ivy Zelman: I'm sorry to interrupt. It's not the mortgage rate per se going up? It's more just getting the credit approved or whatever the stringent underwriting standards may be but the traffic is there and there seems to be demand? It's just the tougher underwriting standards, not the rate itself?
Jon Jaffe: It's really; we're seeing plenty of demand Ivy. As standards have got tighter we're seeing some benefit from improving appraisals as we move across the country and I think you've asked enough of your questions. We can move on. Nice try.
Ivy Zelman: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Jonathan Ellis with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ellis: Thank you. First question, just on gross margins. If we look at the fourth quarter can you help us understand, if I heard you correctly there was some benefit from the Chinese drywall recovery? Could you, if possible, quantify that and then also was there any difference in the mix of spec sales in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter?
Bruce Gross: Well let me talk to the gross margin Jon. There was no benefit in the fourth quarter from Chinese Drywall. In the third quarter we had some benefit from recoveries but in this quarter we just reported there was no positive benefit relating to Chinese drywall and the Chinese drywall accruals that we made are adequate and there is opportunity for third party recoveries that we're still working on that could help future quarters but there was not anything in the fourth quarter. And then relative to spec sales compared to another quarter, there really wasn't a significant difference in this quarter compared to past quarters.
Jonathan Ellis: Okay and just, in terms of your community growth for next year? Do you anticipate that based on what you've been able to acquire thus far that the community count increase could be concentrated in certain regions more so than others such that they may have an influence on your delivery pricing next year, just based on geographic mix?
Bruce Gross: From a regional standpoint we have the composition of the things that we put under contract has varied quarter to quarter. And from our perspective we're investing the capital where the best opportunities are, not geographic mix, so that means we're doing a deal in Raleigh versus in Denver, that's what we're going to do.
Stuart Miller: Yes as I've noted many times we are very sub market specific, Micro market and it's really a question of where we'd find a sub market that are outperforming the norm. That's where we're investing capital. It can be in California. It can be in Raleigh or Florida. It's more about the sub market.
Jonathan Ellis: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan- JP Morgan, Chase. Your line is open.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My first question, just to go back to the gross margins. I guess the incentives went up you said about 1,300 per home, which was much less than what you'd been looking. I was wondering if you could just drill down a little bit into the drivers for that be it mix or just perhaps a better overall or less competitive environment than you might have feared? Just in terms of the actual versus expected?
Bruce Gross: Let me just clarify the numbers, Mike. We had estimated in the last quarter conference call that our sales incentives would increase $2,000 to $5,000 per home and the actual increase was $3,100. It was very much within our expectations during the quarter. Our success again in the quarter, as we indicated is the combination of deliveries from new communities with high margins, our focus on controlling costs and then on a year-over-year basis was the reduction in sales incentives with the prior year.
Michael Rehaut: Okay, I guess I misheard that and missed my first question. Maybe I could make it up with the second. On orders, still getting a lot of positive benefits in the East and I assume a lot of that is coming from the assets that you purchased from Starwood and how those communities are working out? At the same time the West and Houston continue to be drags. I was wondering what we can expect over the next 12 months in those regions if you have some community count growth or expect some stabilization in those regions or perhaps growing off of the lower base that you're at right now?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. I think consistent with the prior answers. It's very submarket specific and we are finding opportunities in Houston and then in the West Markets, and particular communities to acquire new assets that meet our underwriting standards of 20% plus gross margin and 20% IRR. So it will be driven by those opportunities as they come up and expect probably about the same level activity but it will just depend on how those markets perform.
Michael Rehaut: Okay. One last quick one if I could? Pricing trends given that the higher incentives were roughly in line with your outlook. Are you seeing any surprises? KB said that they still feel comfortable with some pricing discipline in the market. Are you seeing similar, you have similar observations across the different regions?
Jon Jaffe: This is preseason right now from the standpoint just typically where we sell a lot of homes. I think that December and January will maybe be a more tougher pricing environment, but as the year moves through with the increased traffic, pricing should get a little bit better. But notwithstanding that, we're priced in the marketplace in all of our communities to sell and we're building hundreds at cost structure.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is coming from Carl Reichardt, Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Carl Reichardt: Hey guys, how are you? I have a question about the 25% decline in directs that you mentioned, Stuart. Is that on a per foot basis and how much of that decline would you attribute to better supply chain-buying materials cost versus (inaudible) the house versus efficient construction? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is sustainable going forward?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. There's been a focus on several levels in the company that probably the biggest percentage goes to our national purchasing efforts which works hand in hand with our divisions, Carl so that's the combination of the efficient designs, working that at a national level on our item after item, item by item to bring costs down. So those two elements combined are probably the largest portion of it. And then market by market we've introduced really cost engineered efficient designs, as we said easy and quick to build. That probably accounts for I'd say maybe 25% of that cost savings and the majority of it being around the, that national purchasing with the actual design and working with the trades. Stuart Miller Carl, let me just add to that and say, look, a portion of our cost reductions and they've been substantial is the results of a tremendous amount of focus, particularly on Jon's part. It's attributable to working conditions, working the supply chain and the like but there's a sizable portion of these reductions that are structural in nature. We've disentangled the purchase of labor and materials across the board. We've got our hands around specific material costs and we're buying more directly. We have a national purchasing program that has spread consistency across the country for us. So we feel good about the cost reductions as it relates to current market conditions and driving gross margins in current market conditions. But we're perhaps even more optimistic about the permanent portion of those cost savings that will impact our margin positively, as market conditions, even as market conditions recover.
Carl Reichardt: Thanks, Stuart. And my second and last question, on the $84 million you spent, home sites 2,100 home sites. Did any of that come through Rialto and if so, how much?
Stuart Miller: Yes. Of the $84 million that we spent Carl on home sites, it was actually 2,500 home sites that we purchased and just a small number, a little less than 10% of that, the purchases came through relationships with Rialto.
Carl Reichardt: Terrific. Thanks, guys.
Operator: The next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS. Your line is open.
David Goldberg: Good morning, everybody. First question, Stuart. Good to hear, I feel like it's been a little while since it's been talked about on the call and I'm kind of focused on and I'm wondering if you could talk, if there's been any changes in the way that you guys execute the EI program and then with that how you measure the success of everything included in terms of generating demand relative to a more option driven than customization driven model in the market?
Stuart Miller: Look, we've always felt that a solid Everything's Included program with a lot of concentration on including options and upgrades that are the primary focus of our customers is the best way to drive value and to keep overhead low. And that's what our Everything's Included program has done. I guess modifications that we've made to the program; it's kind of an interesting dynamic here. There's somewhat of a tug between Jon and Rick. Jon (inaudible) has done everything included and Rick some modification for today's current environment. We have created some spec level packages that enable our customers to kind of broadly change the spec level of their home in many of our communities. But by and large we have maintained a very low overhead structure in appealing to our customers on an Everything's Included basis while affording them the opportunity to alter the spec level of their home in a packaged format. It just keeps our program very efficient and simple to operate.
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. I would just add to that that we continue to hear from our customers that they really appreciate the ease of the process of purchasing in Everything's Included home and the value associated with that. And as Stuart said we really have for this marketplace designed it so that the packages are affordable and available to every customer, type and desire.
Stuart Miller: Yes, good, better and best packages but everything's included in the package.
David Goldberg: And then if I could just get one more quick one in here. Just to understand I know you said first quarter profitability might be pressured a little bit. It might be more challenging, would that change your expectations for reversing the per tax (inaudible) loans, you guys did lose money in the first quarter from an operating perspective?
Stuart Miller: It doesn't change my expectations. As we've said all along, the auditors but I don't think one quarter because of low volume where we have positive operating margins will be a change to the trend that we are on to be able to reverse the BTA reserve.
David Goldberg: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Josh Levin with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Josh Levin: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. When mortgage rates increased rapidly in December did you notice any changes in traffic in sales patterns in your communities? Did it have a negative effect or did it have a positive effect, create a sense of urgency?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. No we really didn't see it impact the traffic patterns. We didn't see what we sometimes have historically seen where rising rates might cause some people to get off the fence either. It seemed to be a continuation of the existing market conditions, part of that might be just because it occurred during the holiday season and the end of the year where things tend to be a little bit muted in terms of demand anyway but bottom line is we really didn't see an impact one way or the other.
Josh Levin: Okay and second question. In the second half of '010 many of the homebuilders said that they were not going to materially lower prices or increase incentives because they felt that demand was going to last and it just wouldn't make a difference. All it would do is take away margin, so now we're looking towards the spring, the spring selling season starts in a few weeks and how do you think about the pricing strategy going into spring? If it turns out to be a lackluster spring is there a point where you would start to lower prices and increase incentives in a meaningful way or are we still, or are we just not going to move the needle?
Bruce Gross: I think that within our environment, pricing is a daily function. We stay very, very close to the market at the division and regional level. Our pricing is very reflective of what's happening in the market at a given moment in time. To superimpose kind of a macro view as we look ahead to the spring and the spring selling season, would be getting way ahead of ourselves. It's going to be very micro market specific and while it might roll up to an overall trend, I'm not so sure that the trend will be reflective of anything important. It's micro market by micro market pricing everyday and every week, it's discussions between the sales group, the division president, and regional president. We're very focused on pricing and keeping it reflective of the existing market condition.
Stuart Miller: And more importantly our production pace, our start pace is really geared towards the current traffic that we're seeing today. But to the extent that traffic picks up with our rebound of buyers to the market then we'll modestly increase our production pace. But it really shouldn't have that dramatic of an effect on pricing.
Josh Levin- Citigroup: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is coming from Stephen East, Ticonderoga Securities. Your line is open.
Stephen East: Thank you. Good morning. Just to follow on Josh's question a little bit. Last quarter you were very clear about where your incentives are going, that they were going up and you were going to move some products. Now you're much more circumspect about what's going on. Is that more of a function of the market or are you more comfortable with where your spec level is? Is it more internal versus external?
Stuart Miller: Steve, I think as we went into, as came out of the third quarter and went into the fourth, we recognized that we were going into the real soft spot of the year. And we could really see that the trend was negative and was somewhat mired in a combination of market trend and the seasonality that is overall generally negative. We're now coming out of the fourth quarter and into the first and I think that we're less pessimistic and I wouldn't paint an optimistic picture but I would say that the market condition is what it is. We're not going into the negative but instead to the positive side of seasonality and we'd like to wait and see how the market presents itself. We're certainly not anticipating moves upwards. We generally have a negative bias but we're not anticipating right now further erosion of gross margin or further incentive programs.
Stephen East: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just switching to land, two quick questions on there. One, what do you expect will the land span for 2011? And then the second thing, you had deferred revenues in lands sales, is that a one time event or something that's going to continue and you all can give us some guidance on?
Stuart Miller: Steve, as far as land span. If you were just to look at the land that came out through (inaudible). It's been in the $500 to $600 million that's been coming out and we expect that to increase as we find opportunities next year. So we'll be north of that $500 to $600 million mark that came out of deliveries that year and depending on what gross rate we find and that's dependent on market conditions, that number or how we'll go from there but our balance sheet is liquid. We're focusing on a lot of interesting opportunities and if we could bring those to conclusion, then we'll grow beyond what's coming out of sales.
Stephen East: Okay and then on the deferred?
Stuart Miller: Yes, on the deferred, every quarter there's some items that aren't expected one way or the other. We didn't expect, if you add up all the charges, there was $27 million of impairments between Homebuilding, some right off of the deposits and the like. So as you look at the $13 million of land sale profit, there were some other charges that were right off of deposits and the like. I look at that whole group as something we don't project. So the deferred revenue for that one particular item doesn't recur and I would hope some of the charges that we took this quarter don't recur either.
Stephen East: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question is coming from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Your line is open.
Jade Rahmani: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on Rialto, how you would characterize the investment climate today versus say one to two quarters ago? Are you see pricing becoming more favorable to the banks and banks being more realistic on valuation and price expectation? And then secondly on CNBS some trade publications have indicated Rialto has been an active buyer of B-Notes and new securitizations, do you look at this as flow business and if new CNBS originations were to hit say 50 billion this year how much capital would you allocate to the CNBS sector? Thank you.
Jeff Krasnof: Yes, in terms of your first, this is Jeff Krasnof by the way. In terms of your first question, we are seeing and we anticipated that we were going to see this happen after the FDIC sort of kick started the market. We've seen significant activity from a lot of the  banks, particularly the regional banks have had an opportunity, number one to earn their way out of some of their issues, raise new capital and so on, and so forth. So we are seeing a lot more realistic approaches from these institutions about selling assets and obviously you can see we've been, we were involved this past quarter in three deals with regional banks, as well as we did that one small deal right, as Stuart mentioned, right at New Year's, so we feel that the climate there is kind of reaching a very nice point for us. Particularly considering the infrastructure we already have in and the access that we've got through a number of these institutions.
Stuart Miller: Let me add. We've seen increased activity in terms of the availability of products in the marketplace and bids and negotiations to buy assets. We think that the timing of closing our funds is particularly opportune. The additional capital to be invested in a distressed market will be welcomed with a good deal flow. We're currently underwriting literally billions of dollars of additional asset purchases, which we've incorporated in a very disciplined program of underwriting and bidding and negotiating for prices that we're comfortable with. We're very comfortable that we'll be able to fill the bucket continuing going forward. As it relates to the CNBS market we've most certainly put our toe back in the water, relative to CNBS. It has been reported we have noted that we have bought a couple of unrated deals. This again is an area that we are very comfortable with and we've developed tremendous expertise through the 90's and 2000's building a business. It is directly related to the primary Rialto business. Right now the amount of money that we're committing to that business is very limited and it is again, invested dollars that will produce outside returns.
Jade Rahmani: Thanks very much and then secondly, just on the funds can you just give some insight on how did you choose between choosing the (inaudible) fund capital versus Lennar's own capital? Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Well, we recognized that the capital would limited for an opportunity set that was very large and would continue, at least through the next year to present itself as an arena in which we'd want to invest and could produce exciting returns. So we felt that it was a good time for us to access the private capital markets to augment the dollars that Lennar would be investing. The dollars that we have invested to date, Lennar's dollars will remain as Lennar's investments. It is new investments that will be invested through the funds. As noted, Lennar is invested in the fund and we'll have the opportunity to co invest as we go forward. We think that the fund gives us the maximum in flexibility in terms of being able to invest in Lennar's capital and being able to deploy Lennar's and Rialto's machine to be able to continue to produce outsized returns.
Jon Jaffe: And it's also a way for us to enhance our returns because of the incentives that are built in to the fund in terms of the incentive fees.
Stuart Miller: And with that, let's take one more question.
Operator: The last question is coming from Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Daniel Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the El Toro restructuring and how you are looking at that in terms and what happens in the terms of the equity you have in that? And then any other joint ventures in terms of financing that you see over the course of the year?
Jon Jaffe: This is Jon. We're very excited about El Toro. It's a great land position in one of the most desirable markets in the country. And with this debt restructuring and partnership restructuring, we really stabilize the capitalization of the project for the next seven plus years, which will give us the ability to monetize the assets. So, as we said today we're really exited about that. Just submitted the next level of maps to the city for entitlement just yesterday. As a result of that restructuring and now we're moving forward.
Stuart Miller: Let me add to that and say that the El Toro restructuring, somewhat similar to the new (inaudible) restructuring. It really positions the company well to be invested in a strategic asset in a long-term excellent market. These restructurings have come with some pain. In 2010, Jon added five years to his age and the restructuring take a tremendous amount of time and energy. Welcome to (inaudible) it now done and complete we are positioned to be invested in and involved in a really important strategic asset in Southern California. And we're really enthusiastic about that. I think that similarly many of our joint ventures have been and continue to be restructured and will ultimately benefit the company going forward. Over the past five years we have taken a lot of pain on some of these ventures. As we come out of 2010 we are getting better and better positioned to reap some benefits from some of those deals as we go forward.
Daniel Oppenheim: Okay. Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. Well listen, thank you everyone for joining us for our 2010 update. The year has been a solid year of repositioning of the company. We're not only positioned for profitability as we look ahead but more importantly we are positioned for operating leverage as the market ultimately finds a bottom and begins to recover. Thank you for joining us.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would now like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Great. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2010 update. I'm joined this morning, as always, by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, we have Rick Beckwitt here, our Executive Vice President, who will be available to answer question; and, Jeff Krasnoff, the Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment. Now I'm going to begin with some opening remarks about the current housing market in general and the progress that we've made on managing our balance sheet and our joint ventures. And since we've just finished our quarterly operations review, I'm also going to share with you our views on our homebuilding operations as well. Then Jeff is going to comment on our Rialto segment positioning for 2010 and beyond. And finally, Bruce will provide additional detail on our numbers. And then, of course, we'll open the phones to your questions. And as always, I'd like to request that in our Q&A period, everyone please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of the participants. So let me begin and make just a few overview comments about the market and about our second quarter. To begin, let me say that we're very pleased that our second quarter results represent a fundamental return to profitability for Lennar, with earnings per share of $0.21 versus a loss of $0.76 last year. We posted solid operating performance from our homebuilding segment, our financial services arm, and we saw our first profits from our newly formed Rialto segment. And at the same time, we saw valuation adjustments or impairments substantially reduced from just under $100 million at second quarter last year to $6.1 million this year. Accordingly, we remain confident that we will be profitable in 2010. But while we feel comfortable that we positioned the company for current market conditions, we realized that the greater focus of the investor community is on questions concerning the road ahead. In my remarks in last quarter's conference call, I noted that the recovery in housing is not presenting itself as a V-shaped return to better time. But instead, it's proving to be a rocky, stabilizing bottom, with visibility obscured by more questions than clear answers. At that time, while the housing market seemed more stabilized than today, we knew and expected that the end of the $8,000 tax credit in April, that it kick-started the housing market back to life would draw demand forward and leave a void that would have to be filled by free market forces driven by low affordable home prices and historically low interest rates. We knew at that time that this void would not feel good, and it doesn't. Today's reality is that the new home market and housing in general still face serious headwinds from current economic and legislative conditions. Nevertheless, we are still confident that the housing market and the overall economy are continuing to stabilize and are generally in recovery. With that said, the current reality is that the overhang of foreclosures and the prospect of additional delinquencies ahead continue to moderate this recovery as shadow inventory continues to be absorbed and even replenished. Unemployment and a generally sluggish economic bounce back combined to hold demand the traditionally low levels, while the reality of the pull-back driven by the elimination of legislative and fiscal incentives limit visibility and create pending uncertainties about the immediate future of the strength of the market. And finally, debates over whether inflation or deflation lies ahead and the impact of sovereign credit risks continue to add uncertainty to the view ahead. Over the past couple of days, we at Lennar have carefully reviewed our operations with our regional and our division presidents. After careful review, we continued to be inclined to believe that the current pull-back in demand is temporary and the void left by the expiration of the tax credit will be filled in the upcoming months by purchasers looking to take advantage of historically low interest rates supporting the purchase of extremely well-priced homes. As we reviewed our operations from the field, geography by geography, we heard some common themes that continue to appear to validate the overall trend towards stabilization of the housing market. First, prices are not free-falling in the face of a moderation and demand. And in fact in many markets, prices are continuing to stabilize and even modestly recover. This is primarily because inventories of new homes are low and have remained in check. In most of our division, there continues to be a meaningful reduction in the incentive use – incentives used in the sales process. And that fact is reflecting itself in higher gross margin. For the company overall, incentives were 11.5% this quarter, down from 12.5% last quarter and 17.3% last year. And margins improved on a pre-impairment basis to 21.4%, from 20.3% last quarter and 14% last year. While in the short term, incentives might creep up, the general consensus among our divisions was that the use will be limited. While this trend is vulnerable to the gyrations of the stabilization process, it seems that the momentum provided by consumer confidence are generally improving and stabilizing economy, low interest rates that are likely to remain low, and home affordability will likely equalize their impact over a short period of time. The free market seems well-positioned to take over from stimulus in a fairly orderly fashion. Next, inventories of new homes, as I said, remain significantly reduced. While there's been a great deal of talk about spec building of new homes to beat the end of the tax credit, we found, from the field, that this was limited to a very few markets. In most markets, new homes were, and are, still being built to order. And for the segment of the market that wants a new home, there are really limited immediate opportunities to choose from. And that's helping prices and incentives to stabilize. Next, we heard that while foreclosures continue to be a significant driver of absorption and pricing, the effect continues to decline as the bulk of foreclosure activity is situated in areas that should not compete with new home construction, such as the inner city and the extreme outskirts of the markets in which we operate. As I've noted many times before, housing is a very localize business, and inventories in micro markets, not broad markets, are most important in considering demand trends. In our reviews with our divisions, we are finding – we found that there are very few foreclosures in the communities in which we – in which we are building or in direct competition – or are in direct competition with our product. The better situated foreclosure homes had been, and are continuing to be, absorbed in an orderly fashion and the market is clearing the inventory overhang in many locations. The $8,000 tax credit facilitated that clearing process. And we think that low prices and low interest rates will facilitate a continuation of that process. Finally, we also heard from our division heads that the employment rate in many of our markets continues to be at least stabilizing, and in some instances, beginning to recover. Accordingly, a general sense of confidence is continuing to return to the consumer. And there's a tangible sense that with prices and interest rates low, now is the right time to purchase as home for future security. This is perhaps the most important element driving the future of the housing market as the threat of losing one's job has deterred many from the housing market for some time now. Even with the current pull-back in demand, we feel that our strategy of focusing on high margins and controlled volume, controlled cost, and controlled G&A will continue to benefit us and enable us to remain profitable as the grounds continues to find stabilization beneath us. We've continued to make carefully underwritten strategic acquisitions in well-positioned markets that support our homebuilding business going forward. And we've been able to find acquisitions of home sites to build new communities where homes can be delivered at a responsible profit level at today's price level and given zero market appreciation. Our homebuilding machine is operating very well in these difficult market conditions. Additionally, as noted in our press release, our balance sheet remains fortified with a homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio net of homebuilding cash of 42.2% and homebuilding cash of approximately $1.1 billion. We also fortified our balance sheet this quarter with a strategic combination of convertible notes, eight-year bonds, and debt repurchase that Bruce will review in just a few minutes. We've also continued the process of reducing the number of our joint ventures, which has fallen to 53 currently and down from 58 last quarter. Many of these remaining joint ventures are good ventures that have already been reworked and have solid assets that are positioned for the future. And we expect to continue to reduce these numbers as we go forward through 2010. Additionally, we've continued to reduce the maximum recourse debt to the company, which is now at a level of $234 million, and is down from $275 million just last quarter. Finally, on the opportunity side, our first strategic investments in the Rialto segment of our business are beginning to show the value of this business opportunity. As I noted in prior quarters, we've been preparing to be a significant participant in the distressed opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles. We've been incubating an operating team of experienced professionals for the past three years. The team is formed. And it's operating. And our first investments are really proving up. While I'll let Jeff Krasnoff update you on this program, I will note that we've made a meaningful investment – that we've made meaningful investments. And we believe we will add significant shareholder value as we go forward. This is a tough business that we do exceptionally well. Earlier this week, we had our weekly asset manager's meeting. And as I review – and as I've reviewed each week our assets with our asset managers from around the country, I continue to become increasingly enthusiastic to see just how comfortably we operate and manage this very unique segment. We're clearly beginning to see more opportunities present themselves in this area. And with our unique expertise, we expect to be an active participant in this part of the market recovery as we feel these investments can add outsized returns to our recovering homebuilding operation. At the end of the day, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made to date and are very excited – and are very excited about the position that our company is in even in these difficult market conditions and uncertain times. Our balance sheet is strong and well-positioned with liquidity to support investment for the future. Our core homebuilding operations are lean, right-sized, and well-positioned for success as they are beginning to grow again, adding communities and leveraging our overhead. And our Rialto investment segment is now fully operational and investing capital to create strong returns as we build profitability. While we recognize that the current economic environment is fragile, we feel today that we are extremely well-positioned to navigate the rocky bottom and ultimate recovery that continues to lie ahead. And we continue to feel comfortable that we'll be profitable in and in each quarter in 2010. Now, let me turn over to Jeff Krasnoff to give you some additional color on our Rialto segment, and then over to Bruce for additional color on our numbers.
Jeff Krasnoff: Thanks, Stuart. Good morning, everyone. While we started building the Rialto team here inside Lennar almost three years ago, it was just last quarter, coinciding with the closing of our first two distressed asset portfolios in partnership with the FDIC, that Lennar announced the new Rialto investment segment. And now, as Stuart has already indicated, the Rialto segment is profitable. As Bruce will walk through in a minute, the main contributors to this is our 40% share of the FDIC transactions, our public-private investment fund activities with Alliance Bernstein and the US Department of Treasury or PPIP, and the management fees from both these programs. Some of you may be familiar with the disciplined process that we've employed over the years for looking at large portfolios of assets based on a careful review of underlying collateral value, loan documents, and borrower and guarantor capabilities on an asset-by-asset basis. Our detailed due diligence reviews, combined with our resolution process and real estate operating capabilities, allow us to look at these portfolios on a wholesale basis, and through our operations bring value to individual assets on a retail basis. And because of a high content of loans made to developers, having Lennar's unique view, we believe, gives us a distinctive advantage in our evaluation of these assets. For our first two FDIC portfolios, for instance, we worked for over four months on the underlying due diligence. During the quarter, we finished the process of bringing all 5,500 of the loans in these FDIC transactions on board from the 22 different receiverships. We also made great progress in reaching out to borrowers, while at the same time building out the core of our operations team to create value from these assets. We now have 70 associates focused on our portfolio operations, including loan work out, property asset management, servicing, finance, and back – office operations in three offices located in Miami, Atlanta, and New York. And our team contains a lot of familiar faces, a number of whom were here a couple of decades ago when we did something very similar. By leaning on Lennar, we clearly had a head start in being able to set up our infrastructure very quickly. We've also been able to employ the servicing and small balance loan collection resources of Clayton Holdings, a company in which we made a small investment in 2008. We're already deep into the portfolios. We have our operations teams focused on the top 550 borrower relationships, which makes up over 85% of the total $3 billion of unpaid principal balance in these two transactions. We've already had direct conversations with about 90% of these borrowers and related guarantors by balance and have had meetings with over half of them to resolve their loans. A number of relationships have already been resolved, and many are in progress. With our early activities, we've collected over $60 million of interests and principal, about 20% of which were full pay-offs at par, plus accrued interests. The cash flow has been used to pay the operating costs of the portfolio, including fees to Rialto for managing the process. And as of the end of the first goal [ph] quarter, we had already reduced the FDIC financing by $34 million to $593 million. Our PPIP program continues on course as well. During the quarter, our team wrapped up our private equity rates topping out at $1.16 billion. With the matching equity from US Treasury and advantageous LIBOR plus 1% 10-year financing, our fund has $4.6 billion of purchasing power. We have committed $75 million of equity to the program, which is now 85% drawn. With our disciplined approach to focusing on resilient cash flows, we have now acquired approximately $3.3 billion of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. We are also very pleased with the underlying performance of our portfolio, and believe we are on track to achieve the types of returns we anticipated when we purchased them. With the stepped up efforts of the FDIC, and more recently, some of the banks themselves, the pipeline of opportunity, as Stuart mentioned, continues to expand. Our due diligence team is currently evaluating several billion dollars of opportunities today, assisted by our core operations group, that is deeply involved in many of the markets working on the assets, and of course, the one on our own homebuilding team. As we go through this process of reviewing distressed assets, we also look forward to finding new opportunities for the homebuilding side of the business. And along those lines, we've already helped to tie-up of over 700 home sites in nine different communities for the Lennar homebuilding division. The Rialto team is very excited about our position today. And we look forward to reporting to you on our progress in the future quarters. Now, I'm going to turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our road back profitability this quarter included positive operating earnings contributions from all three of our business units. Our homebuilding business unit had operating earnings of $29.5 million during the quarter. And that's compared to a loss of $116.5 million in the prior year. Revenues from home sales decreased to 12% to $695 million due to an 8% decrease in home deliveries, excluding JVs, and a 5% decrease in average sales price to $240,000. The overall average sales price decrease was partially due to fewer deliveries from the West segment, which had a higher average sales price than the company's average. The average sales price changed regionally year-over-year as follows. The east region was up 1% to $222,000. The central region was up 1% to $198,000. The west region was down 9% to $318,000. Houston was up 8% to $217,000. And other was down 7% to $253,000. Our gross margin increased 1,100 basis points, inclusive of impairments, to 20.6%, compared to the prior year. This improvement is primarily due to a significant reduction in sales incentives and the decline in valuation adjustments that Stuart mentioned. Sales incentives declined from $53,000 per home in the prior year's quarter to $31,000 per home in this quarter. That was a reduction from 17.3% of home sales to 11.3% of home sales revenue. The sequential improvement was also 100 basis points from the first to the second quarter, looking at sales incentives as a percentage of revenue. And the lower sales incentives for home delivered is a result of not only the improved selling environment that we had in the first part of the year, but our repositioned product strategy as well as fewer completed unsold homes. Additionally, the impairments were down from $99.1 million to $6.1 million in the current year's quarter. We're continuing to realize the benefits from our aggressive cost – cutting measures and lower non-recurring expenses in areas of legal and occupancy costs, which helped as to reduce SG&A costs by approximately $15.7 million or 14% year-over-year. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue from home sales, was 13.9%, which improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 190 basis points sequentially from our first quarter. The fundamental success with our improved gross margins and reduced SG&A led to an operating margin of 6.7%. And that's the highest start operating margin that we have seen in four years. Turning to our financial services business unit, they generated operating earnings of $13.7 million versus $16.5 million of profit in the prior year. This was a result of lower volumes in both our mortgage and title operations, mortgage pretax earnings was a profit of $9.3 million versus $14 million in the prior year, and our title company had a loss of 400,000 versus a $3.2 million profit in the prior year. Additionally, our financial services segment recorded just over $5 million of profit relating to the collection of the deferred payment from the previous sale of the cable system. Following up on the Jeff's description of Rialto, our third business unit, we generated operating earnings totaling $5.1 million during the quarter. When you look at our income statement, the $5.1 million is the netting of $14.7 million of Rialto operating earnings, less the $9.6 million included in the line that's called net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. As we reported last quarter, we consolidated the FDIC portfolios. And therefore, our second quarter numbers reflect all the activity from the FDIC portfolios with an offset attributable to non-controlling interests. The summary of Rialto's $5.1 million of operating earnings is $9 million of earnings from our 40% share of the FDIC portfolios, plus management fees relating to the FDIC portfolios, plus $1.6 million of earnings from PPIP, less approximately $5.4 million of G&A expenses. This is the first quarter of revenue contribution from the FDIC portfolios acquired in February. Management fees and accretable interest income, net of expenses from these portfolios, totaled $9 million. Revenue recognition from these portfolios is recorded based on the expected cash flow from the portfolios to calculate accretable interest income. These cash flows include both expected loan pay-offs and interest income. As Jeff mentioned, the cash flow generated during the quarter was used to defuse [ph] the debt. And we did reduce the FDIC debt from $627 million to $593 million during the quarter. PPIP management fees and interest income was $1.6 million. And the PPIP fund has already started distributing cash flow from these earnings back to the partners. Included in the summarized numbers are approximately $2 million of startup expenses relating to the two FDIC portfolios. These are non-recurring costs and are included in both the FDIC and G&A numbers I mentioned above. Turning to corporate items, other expense includes $10.8 million of expenses associated with our $289 million debt tender during the quarter. And that was partially offset with the gain on retirement of bank debt at a discount of $4.3 million. Corporate G&A expenses were reduced by $7.5 million or 25% over the quarter versus the prior year. And the reductions were a result of successful cost reduction initiatives in the personnel, occupancy, IT, and legal categories. Taxes, if you look at our tax line, you'll see that that there was $11 million benefit during the quarter relating to the resolution of uncertain tax positions previously recorded. And as we turn to the balance sheet, our homebuilding cash inclusive of restrictive cash totaled to $1.2 billion during the quarter. We issued $250 million of 6.95% senior notes due 2018 during the quarter and $276.5 million of 2% convertible debt, up 38% with a conversion price of $27.64 [ph] during the quarter, and that's due 2020, while repurchasing through tender $289 million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes that were due between 2010 and March of 2013. These transactions enhanced our balance sheet strength by pushing out near term debt maturities and adding liquidity to the balance sheet. In addition to the tender, we repurchased $38 million of senior notes due 2010 and 2011. Our leverage remained low. As Stuart mentioned, homebuilding debt-to-total cap was 42.2% in the second quarter net of our cash. And we made tremendous progress on the joint ventures. Of those 53 joint ventures Stuart discussed, 23 have no debt, 14 have non-recourse debt, and only 16 have any recourse debt at all. We made tremendous progress on reducing our joint venture recourse indebtedness with the joint ventures reducing it by $545 million sequentially from last quarter to $234, million and net of reimbursement agreements that was down to $146 million. We continued to carefully manage our inventory. And we ended the quarter with very few completed unsold homes averaging between one and two per community. We closed on approximately 3,000 home sites during the quarter, totaling $109 million of purchase price in well-located, ready-to-go communities. Additionally, we put approximately 1,400 home sites under option contract during the quarter. And our overall inventory dollars remain flat with the prior year at $3.7 billion, excluding consolidated inventory not owned. There were approximately 3,300 starts during the quarter, which was up 20% over prior year. And there were 2,000 – I'm sorry, 82,000 home sites owned and 22,000 controlled at quarter-end, totaling 104,000. The company's strategies have positioned well to continue to generate profitability in all three of our business units. And our balance sheet is financially strong to capitalize on additional new investment opportunities. With that, let me turn it over to the operator for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.
Allan – Zelman & Associates: Good morning, guys. It's actually Allan [ph] on for Ivy. I appreciate your commentary on May there. I was wondering if you could chat a little bit about the upcoming deadline for the closings of the tax credit. When you think about your backlog of about 2,500 homes, what would you estimate is potentially at risk of not closing in time for the June 30th deadline that maybe previously would have thought – would have closed? I know the NAR was – at this week, was an estimate that 180,000 or so home buyers who thought that they were getting credit that may not close in time. So I was curious if that's a problem that you foresee.
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, this is Rick Beckwitt. We've carefully mapped out construction schedules associated with anything that was sold with the tax credit in mind. And across the board, we have maybe one or two, or a handful of things that are at risk. And I believe that all those will close within the deadline.
Allan: Okay. Great, got it. That's very helpful. And then, just on your commentary, a little bit, Stuart, about incentives maybe creeping up a little bit in the near term, how would you expect that to flow through to the margin over the next couple of quarters? Do you think that that's going to have a downside impact on margin or is there enough impact from maybe some new projects coming on line to offset that? In other words, do you think margin continuous to move higher from here despite the higher incentives in the near term?
Zelman & Associates: Okay. Great, got it. That's very helpful. And then, just on your commentary, a little bit, Stuart, about incentives maybe creeping up a little bit in the near term, how would you expect that to flow through to the margin over the next couple of quarters? Do you think that that's going to have a downside impact on margin or is there enough impact from maybe some new projects coming on line to offset that? In other words, do you think margin continuous to move higher from here despite the higher incentives in the near term?
Stuart Miller: We have a lot of discussion about this with our division people. And we really drove down on their view given what has been a moderating traffic pattern and demand in May, and even flowing into June. And the perspective is that there might be some movement on incentives just to keep the market moving forward, but that it would be fair – it would be pretty limited. I think you properly highlighted that we do have new communities that has started to come on line and contribute a little bit more to our margins. And we would expect – I don't want to give a projection, but we would expect pretty good stabilized and even an improving margin picture as we go forward.
Rick Beckwitt:
 :
Allan: Great. I appreciate that color. Thanks, guys.
Zelman & Associates: Great. I appreciate that color. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joshua Pollard of Goldman Sachs.
Joshua Pollard: Hey, good morning, and thanks for all the detail. You talked a little bit about June, but I was wondering if there was – somehow you could characterize what you're seeing throughout June. Is it improving as the month is going along? Are you guys not seeing a ton of – how would you characterize your de – stabilization for June?
Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning, and thanks for all the detail. You talked a little bit about June, but I was wondering if there was – somehow you could characterize what you're seeing throughout June. Is it improving as the month is going along? Are you guys not seeing a ton of – how would you characterize your de – stabilization for June?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes, it's Rick. We typically don't like to give any color on the quarter that we're about to enter into. But we know that there's a lot of focus on June and what's going on. I can tell you, on a seasonal basis, it's the slower quarter on just the annual year. We have seen a modest improvement over May. And right now, we're running, let says, 20%, 25% off of the prior year. It's choppy. We don't have a lot of data right now. We're back from the fact that we've a good stable backlog going into the quarter. As Stuart said in his remarks, we think that buyers will re-emerge. And it's just been a temporary slowdown in the market.
Stuart Miller: I think you (inaudible) that there was a sizeable pull forward of demand in April in order to accommodate the 8,000 tax credit and its termination. But as we've gone through May and as we're coming in to June, we're feeling that demand is starting to make a modest recovery. The sense from the field – there's no certainty in this. But the sense from the field is that as we go forward, it's really going to be low interest rates and the affordable pricing of homes are going to – that will enable the free markets to takeover and stabilize.
Joshua Pollard: That's extremely helpful. My other question is on Rialto. We've had conversations at a lot of FDIC loan purchasers. And one comment was about a barbell approach to the revenue recognition. Upfront, there were folks you hadn't talked to in a while, who hadn't heard from their loan servicers for months or even years. When you guys come in and send the hello-goodbye letters that actually accelerate some of the revenue upfront, and then you see another acceleration of revenues towards the end. Is that what you're expecting? Or should we think about revenue trajectory that you guys have printed in this first quarter to be somewhat of a run rate going forward?
Goldman Sachs: That's extremely helpful. My other question is on Rialto. We've had conversations at a lot of FDIC loan purchasers. And one comment was about a barbell approach to the revenue recognition. Upfront, there were folks you hadn't talked to in a while, who hadn't heard from their loan servicers for months or even years. When you guys come in and send the hello-goodbye letters that actually accelerate some of the revenue upfront, and then you see another acceleration of revenues towards the end. Is that what you're expecting? Or should we think about revenue trajectory that you guys have printed in this first quarter to be somewhat of a run rate going forward?
Jeff Krasnoff: Yes, I would – my first comment, this is Jeff, is that is – what you described is fairly consistent with what we've seen, I guess, really over the last 20 years or so in doing this – in doing this work at business that upfront, there are some guys that do come in with cash. And we're just waiting for someone to call them. But over time – and then there are some assets that eventually might come back in foreclosure and might get resolved a little bit later in the process. So there is somewhat barbell – effect. From the accounting perspective, the way that the literature works, it's really recorded over a period of time based on – what you called, Bruce, the level of yield assets?
Bruce Gross: Accretable is what I said.
Jeff Krasnoff: Accretable yield in assets. So that's really built-in. We have an underlying business plan. We go for asset-by-asset. We have a business for each and every asset, which is then verified by whatever modification we go through with each of the individual borrowers. So it's not unexpected.
Joshua Pollard: So is it – is a way to think about it, even if you get additional cash flows above what you were expecting that it would actually turn into – there would be no effect on revenue, you guys, or almost straight lining it?
Goldman Sachs: So is it – is a way to think about it, even if you get additional cash flows above what you were expecting that it would actually turn into – there would be no effect on revenue, you guys, or almost straight lining it?
Bruce Gross: Well, what we would do there, Josh, is we would adjust our expected cash flow. So to the extent of receiving more than expected, you would adjust those expected cash flows and you would increase the revenue recognition in the current quarter.
Joshua Pollard: Okay, great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.
Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you very much. That's helpful.
Stuart Miller: And on a go-forward basis.
Bruce Gross: And on a go-forward basis.
Joshua Pollard: Okay, understood. Thank you very much.
Goldman Sachs: Okay, understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of J.P. Morgan.
Michael Rehaut: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
J.P. Morgan: Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Michael Rehaut: First question, I was wondering if you could review, and we appreciate all the colors in terms of May and June, any distinction across the different markets you operate in. We were recently in California and saw or believe that that market is held up on a relative basis somewhat better than the nation in terms of pace and price. Any markets that is stronger or weaker relative to this post-tax world?
J.P. Morgan: First question, I was wondering if you could review, and we appreciate all the colors in terms of May and June, any distinction across the different markets you operate in. We were recently in California and saw or believe that that market is held up on a relative basis somewhat better than the nation in terms of pace and price. Any markets that is stronger or weaker relative to this post-tax world?
Stuart Miller: Let me give you a general answer. Maybe Rick will think about it for a second and drill down a little bit more. But the answer to your question, Michael, is that all of the markets are reacting a little bit differently. It's a real micro-market-driven business right now. Where the foreclosures are makes a different. Where the builders might have built some inventory makes it different. And there are submarkets that have held up very, very well. There are submarkets that are faltering. I think there are parts of California that are doing pretty well. But contrary to what some people think, there are parts of Florida that are doing pretty well as well. Probably one of the leaner markets right now would be some of Texas markets and primarily Dallas. So, Rick, maybe you'd want to add to that?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. Surprisingly, Florida's some of our stronger markets right now. I think we're benefiting from the fact that we put under contract a fair number of communities that were attractively purchased or contracted. So we're getting some good traction there. As Stuart said, Texas is somewhat soft. It went into the downturn on the tail end. Dallas is a pretty tough market. Houston is a little better. And you're seeing probably one of the strongest markets in Texas is San Antonio. The Carolinas are our next bag, Raleigh better than Charlotte. In the Mid-Atlantic, we're seeing continued strength stemming from the government spending in Maryland and Virginia. Jersey's pretty decent. And California is very, very community-specific and their communities are doing better. And the once better Mortursuria [ph] are dragging along. I think across the board, we have seen what I would call quality traffic. People understanding that affordability is at a level where it makes sense to buy a home and are just really trying to make a determination as to when they're going to pull the trigger. And that's the sense, really, across the nation right now.
Michael Rehaut – J.P. Morgan: Great. That's a great rundown. I appreciate it, Rick. Second question, in terms of communities, I know you guys don't break it out typically. But I was wondering if you could give us a sense of at least where you are in terms of your community count relative to last quarter and last year, and where you expect that? Do you expect communities to be up year-over-year by the end of your fiscal year? And how are you starting to think about 2011?
Stuart Miller: Sure, Mike. Community count ended at about 426 this quarter. It was up about 40 from last quarter. So we are seeing, with the land purchases that we've made, we're continuing to open new communities. And we would expect to open new communities throughout the year. And that number will grow and will be somewhat dependent on which deals we go forward with. But we would expect that number to grow throughout the year.
Michael Rehaut: And what was it a year ago?
J.P. Morgan: And what was it a year ago?
Stuart Miller: A year ago it ended at 435 at the end of the second quarter. But keep in mind, during the second quarter last year, it was declining. So we had reduced that number by 20 or 25 during the quarter last year.
Michael Rehaut: Great. Thanks a lot.
J.P. Morgan: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question is from John Ellis of Merrill Lynch.
Jay Chadbourn – Merrill Lynch: Hi, this is Jay Chadbourn [ph] for Jonathan Ellis. I was looking for, what was your target – what was your target then in land? And what have you been spending for 2010?
Stuart Miller: We haven't laid out a target. But in the current quarter, the land development spend was somewhere in the mid $30 million range for the quarter.
Jay Chadbourn – Merrill Lynch: Okay. And the second question I had was, what was the deferred tax valuation of allowance at the end of the quarter?
Stuart Miller: It was approximately $650 million.
Jay Chadbourn – Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo Securities.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Hi. Can you talk about how the orders – I think that you mentioned that June was better than May. And you said it was down about 20% or 25%, so that suggests May was down worse than that. Can you talk about intra-quarter order trends, what they were like in all three of the months on a year-over-year basis?
Stuart Miller: Yes. You saw the numbers yesterday, new home sales down 32.5% in May. I think that we saw, progressively through the quarter, better sales in March, fewer in April, and May was down materially. And then as we noted, June's got – feeling a little bit better. And that's where we are.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And then on the – I know you tried to talk about it a bit, but the Rialto revenue recognition, how much of the revenues that you recognized this quarter were cash revenues?
Bruce Gross: Well again, as you look at the revenue recognition, it's based on expected cash flows, okay? So when you look at the revenue, there was $34 million, I think, was the number of revenue. And as Jeff mentioned, we brought in approximately $60 million of cash flow before expenses in Rialto. Net of the expenses, Rialto brought in close to $40 million during the quarter.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg – UBS: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. The first question I wanted to get into, I wanted to delve into your comment about the incentives and really the idea of keeping the market moving. I would suspect that at this point in the cycle, you had a lot more control over the incentives that you were offering, whether you are deciding to offer more incentives or fewer incentives, and how you're thinking about pace versus price at this point. And I'm wondering how much control corporate is having in overseeing individual divisions. And specifically, are there some hard targets from sales perspective that the answer is, "Hey look, if you're not selling this many homes or achieving these targets, you need to start layering in some more incentives." Or how are you thinking about controlling that from a corporate perspective?
Rick Beckwitt: Well from a corporate perspective, we have identified what we think appropriate absorption pace should be for every community that we've got. We've got it targeted by a week, by a month, by quarter. We threw our regional presidents, review traffic trends, sales absorptions, pricing trends. And we've set pace – we've identified where we want margins to be, and as you know it, the good cake with regards to absorption in March. So we are constantly tinkering with those push-pulls. Some of it's driven by what competition does out there. As one of the competitors drops prices or raises prices, it has an impact on what we do as well. But we are really across the nation right now, very close to trends and traffic and sales. So it's something that we monitor from the mothership up here that a lot of the day-to-day decisions are made by the guys running the divisions.
David Goldberg: So just to understand, there'll be change in incentives. There's no hard and fast rule. But at this point, we feel like we're rather slowed the sales pace down. And if that means – and holding sense of steady, it's much more fluid than that. Is that the way you think about it?
UBS: So just to understand, there'll be change in incentives. There's no hard and fast rule. But at this point, we feel like we're rather slowed the sales pace down. And if that means – and holding sense of steady, it's much more fluid than that. Is that the way you think about it?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, it is fluid like that. As Stuart said in his opening remarks, we are very focused on improving margins at the expense of doing volumes. We've got the SG&A down to a point where if we produced the good gross margin, we're going to make money.
David Goldberg: Right.
UBS: Right.
Rick Beckwitt: That's what the divisions are focused on. They want to be profitable.
Stuart Miller: But with that said, let's recognize that the – the ability to hold margin and to measure the response to a slower market is enhanced by the fact that as it relates to new homes, there's not all that much inventory on the ground in most markets. And even the foreclosures and most of the markets in which we're actually operating are fairly light. We really spend a lot of time with our division presidents on these past couple of days. Our perspective is, is we've had a lot of foreclosure inventory, it might be an opportunity to purchase that inventory and make money on that. The fact is that there's not that much of it in the communities in which we're operating. We're really unable to hold price and to get pretty close to our volume expectations. As Rick noted a little earlier, we are able to hold margin as we're maybe forced to bring prices down a little bit because, generally, the construction costs are going down at the same time as volume goes down. So we've really been able to maintain our volume pretty close to our targets and also hold margins.
David Goldberg: Great. And then just as a follow-up question, this is a little bit more of broadly-based here. But I'm thinking about, as we look past the next couple of months, and the new Congressmen would be coming, and who knows what the make-up will be like, but it seems like GSC performance is going to be something everyone's looking at. And I'm trying to get some perspective on where the builders should be. Should the builders have a seat at the table? Do they have a seat at the table? And what your expectations are given the amount of experience and the room in some of these topics? How the builders are thinking this might play out and what kind of precautions you're taking in case you see some hits in mortgage liquidity?
UBS: Great. And then just as a follow-up question, this is a little bit more of broadly-based here.

And what your expectations are given the amount of experience and the room in some of these topics? How the builders are thinking this might play out and what kind of precautions you're taking in case you see some hits in mortgage liquidity?
Stuart Miller: Will the builders have a seat at the table? That's a question I'm just not sure how that will present itself. It certainly seems that there will be, at some point, a lot of attention paid for the GSCs. I think that everybody's going to recognize that the builders, and frankly, the housing participants – housing market participants in general, are going to want to see a program, whether it's GSC-focused or private sector-focused, but it keeps available capital – that keeps capital available to the housing markets. How that's going to present itself, I think that – I think everybody's going to have some kind of voice. But it's going to be a complicated task to figure out where we go from here. There's no question that at some point, the government's going to have to pull back from supporting the capital markets as it relates to housing. But it behooves everybody. And I think everybody recognizes how important it is to do it in a very orderly fashion. The free market will, at some point, take over. But doing anything too suddenly could derail the entire recovery. And I think everybody is acutely aware of that.
David Goldberg: Great. Thank you for the insightful comments.
UBS: Great. Thank you for the insightful comments.
Operator: Our next question is from Dan Oppenheim of Credit Suisse.
Dan Oppenheim: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the comments in terms of possibility this quarter and the tension that's out there in terms of just whether this is a short term issue in terms of demand versus something that persists a little bit longer. And that if we see the volumes flowing, it ends up creating issues in terms of SG&A. How committed are you to that profitability in the quarter as it might mean cutting the overhead more versus wanting – would be willing to tolerate higher SG&A and a short term – and sense of a lack of profitability as the latter part of this year if the lower volume persists?
Credit Suisse: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the comments in terms of possibility this quarter and the tension that's out there in terms of just whether this is a short term issue in terms of demand versus something that persists a little bit longer.

How committed are you to that profitability in the quarter as it might mean cutting the overhead more versus wanting – would be willing to tolerate higher SG&A and a short term – and sense of a lack of profitability as the latter part of this year if the lower volume persists?
Stuart Miller: I think we feel pretty strongly, Dan, that we've positioned the company for the – for market conditions that are where they are, and even for some further tightening. I think that we are operating at – as tight as SG&A level as we could operate. I think we're pretty well-positioned for the market as it moves forward to be able to maintain that profitability. We've got a really excellent machine that's working very, very well. Of course, a significant downturn in the market could change that. And I don't want to mislead anybody. But we have a – we've spent a lot of time with our divisional people thinking about market conditions, potential size of pull-backs, potential stability, where we think things are going to go. The general sense is that we're going to be able to maintain levels of profitability as we go forward. And we're really committed to that.
Dan Oppenheim: Okay. And then secondly, I was just wondering about recent comments that you made in terms of that you've been able to maintain the volume close to the targets. Is that still consistent in terms of the May-June order activity? Or is that more just in terms of we're thinking in terms of closings to the much recent quarter?
Credit Suisse: Okay. And then secondly, I was just wondering about recent comments that you made in terms of that you've been able to maintain the volume close to the targets. Is that still consistent in terms of the May-June order activity? Or is that more just in terms of we're thinking in terms of closings to the much recent quarter?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, keep in mind that it's a seasonal business. And we don't just flat line what our expectations for sales are across the year. We know that as you head into June and July, people are vacationing. It gets a little hot. And people don't necessarily want to be shopping for homes all the time. That being said, we are pretty much on track with what our expectations are and what we budgeted.
Dan Oppenheim: So down 20%, 25% is the expectation?
Credit Suisse: So down 20%, 25% is the expectation?
Stuart Miller: No, that was from the prior year.
Dan Oppenheim: Right.
Credit Suisse: Right.
Rick Beckwitt: So we knew that there would be a falloff in activity when tax credit expires. And we are pretty much in line with where we thought we would be based on that demand going into the pre-May period.
Stuart Miller: Well frankly, Dan, I think that the entire market knew that there'd be a slowdown in demand as we came off of the tax credit. I think it was widely talked about and expected. It's just that the reality of it just doesn't feel good. And I think we're getting a reaction to the way that it feels right now. I think from our vantage point, we clearly thought that there'd be a slowdown and expected that volume levels will be down. So the answer to your question is, yes, we are where we expected to be. And I think it'll find its way back from here.
Dan Oppenheim: Okay. Thanks very much.
Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen East of Ticonderoga Securities.
Stephen East: Good morning. If we look at orders in Houston in the west, they were down pretty sharply. How much of that is a function of community count versus absorption rights? And if it's absorption rights, what do you think is going on there?
Ticonderoga Securities: Good morning. If we look at orders in Houston in the west, they were down pretty sharply. How much of that is a function of community count versus absorption rights? And if it's absorption rights, what do you think is going on there?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, as I said earlier, Houston and Dallas were late to go into the decline. Some of it is absorption pace. A fair amount of it is community count. I'm just looking up some hard numbers for you. On a community count basis, we're somewhere in the 5% to 10% range down on a year-over-year basis. So that's clearly having an impact. And some of that is also skewed by the timing when those come on. So it's the combination of the two.
Stephen East: Okay. Is it similar in the west?
Ticonderoga Securities: Okay. Is it similar in the west?
Rick Beckwitt: That being said, we are making money as usual.
Stephen East: Okay. All right. It's similar in the west?
Ticonderoga Securities: Okay. All right. It's similar in the west?
Rick Beckwitt: It's similar in the west.
Stephen East: Okay. If we look at – Stuart, you said in this environment, you could still make money. Roughly, where would you think is your breakeven volume? And then the other question I had was, just what you're seeing in the land environment, we're hearing that some of the public builders are starting to evacuate from some land deals, et cetera, and just wanted to get a feel for what you all are seeing.
Ticonderoga Securities: Okay. If we look at – Stuart, you said in this environment, you could still make money. Roughly, where would you think is your breakeven volume? And then the other question I had was, just what you're seeing in the land environment, we're hearing that some of the public builders are starting to evacuate from some land deals, et cetera, and just wanted to get a feel for what you all are seeing.
Rick Beckwitt: Just one clarification on the west, on a community count basis, we're down about 15% to 20% in that area.
Stephen East: Okay.
Ticonderoga Securities: Okay.
Rick Beckwitt: Sorry.
Stuart Miller: I'm going to let Bruce talk about the first part of your question. But let me just say, as it relates to some builders starting to back away from land deals, there was a pretty good rush to buy land deals and to tie them up. There were some that went in and tied up whatever they could, and the pricing made you scratch your head. You have to see some real recovery going forward. I think that some of those land deals, as people back away, will start making noise in the market. But a lot of it – certainly, the land deals that we've done are not deals that we want to back away from. We've focused on underwriting them to current market conditions with even some buffer. And we feel pretty good about what we've put under contract. And we're seeing some real results from some of those properties. So I don't see us backing away from the deals that we've put under contract. But there're going to be some deals that get backed away from. They just didn't make sense at the outset. And that will create a little noise in the market. Bruce, do you want to?
Bruce Gross: Yes, your question on breakeven, Stephen, it's not a static environment. So I would say is if you go back in time, we were profitable as a company at much lower volumes. So it's really a function of what's driving lower volumes and our ability to react and either modify our product accordingly. And dependent on how much it drops down, make the appropriate SG&A adjustment as required. So it's more a function of why. But we've been profitable at much lower levels throughout our history, so we have the ability to adjust accordingly.
Stephen East: Sure, I understand. And one other question, on your community count, how much of that is reloaded land versus more historic land?
Ticonderoga Securities: Sure, I understand. And one other question, on your community count, how much of that is reloaded land versus more historic land?
Stuart Miller: We have feathered in – started to feather in a couple of communities this quarter from off both lands. More of it is coming from new opportunities though.
Stephen East: Okay. Thanks.
Ticonderoga Securities: Okay. Thanks.
Rick Beckwitt: Just on the land side, to give you a little bit more color, as we've said over the last several quarters, we were relatively aggressive early on in contracting for some new deals on an option and also a cash basis. If you look sequentially, I think last quarter, we announced that we contracted for about 5,000 plus or minus new homes during the quarter. This quarter, we're about half of that. And that's somewhat driven by the fact that pricing is up a little bit. And we haven't been willing to chase the pricing up. We're only doing deals that since allowed a strong, respectable margin and IRR. If some of the deals that some other folks were chasing at higher price points come back to where we think they should be appropriately priced, I think you'll see a little bit more activity going forward.
Stephen East: Regionally, do you see one area being more rational than the other on those, Rick?
Ticonderoga Securities: Regionally, do you see one area being more rational than the other on those, Rick?
Rick Beckwitt: Yes. But I really don't want to comment on the call about that.
Stephen East: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Ticonderoga Securities: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
Jade Rahmani: Yes, hi. Thank you very much. I was wondering, could you tell us, does your impairment analysis account for the tax credit slowdown – related slowdown in May and also June as you mentioned? And is it possible that a temporary slowdown in absorption pace could trigger future impairments?
KBW: Yes, hi. Thank you very much. I was wondering, could you tell us, does your impairment analysis account for the tax credit slowdown – related slowdown in May and also June as you mentioned? And is it possible that a temporary slowdown in absorption pace could trigger future impairments?
Stuart Miller: We run cash flows on our communities each quarter. And it's based on the current environment that exists. So we adjust that every quarter as we look at that. So it does take into account the real time activity that we've been seeing.
Jade Rahmani: Okay. And then secondly, just regarding your capital allocation and incremental investments, I was wondering if you could just give some color into your thinking on how you plan or how you expect to allocate capital between Rialto and new land investments? You mentioned future high return investment opportunities. What kinds of returns are you targeting? And in which area do you think it's greatest?
KBW: Okay. And then secondly, just regarding your capital allocation and incremental investments, I was wondering if you could just give some color into your thinking on how you plan or how you expect to allocate capital between Rialto and new land investments? You mentioned future high return investment opportunities. What kinds of returns are you targeting? And in which area do you think it's greatest?
Stuart Miller: Well, we have two competing reservoirs fighting for capital right now. And we like that position. We're looking at every land deal and stressing it, and expecting that if we're going to put money into a deal, it's going to have a solid return. And it's competing for capital against the opportunities presented in the Rialto segment. The Rialto segment, we know, if we're going to win a bid, it's going to produce outsized returns. And we want to be investing some – we want to be investing a significant amount of capital in that business as opportunities present themselves. The answer to your question is it's a real balancing act to the extent that we have limited dollars. We're going to be investing those dollars where we can get the most sound return. Let's remember that homebuilding today is a cash generator, by and large, with every home sold and delivered. We are generating cash to support the acquisitions of new home sites because part of the sale of the home is the land underneath it. So there will be capital available just from the operations of the homebuilding segment to support the purchase of new land to the extent that we can find additional land that supports outsized returns we'll be investing in that as well. But we are allocating a lot of capital to our Rialto component right now because we see significant outsized returns coming from those investments.
Jade Rahmani: Great. Thanks very much.
KBW: Great. Thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: Thank you. And I think we'll take one more.
Operator: Our next question comes from Megan McGrath of Barclays.
Megan McGrath: Great. Thanks. Just two questions, the first, a follow-up to your question – the questions around your community count and the pace that we're seeing right now, I'm just trying to get a sense of – and this is for term, let's say, between now and the end of the year. How sensitive to the current pace are your plans to open these communities if we saw the flow now persists, say, into August that felt like it was beyond normal seasonal slowdown? Would that impact your plans these communities for the end of the year? Or is that – are they a longer term two, three-year plan?
Barclays: Great. Thanks. Just two questions, the first, a follow-up to your question – the questions around your community count and the pace that we're seeing right now, I'm just trying to get a sense of – and this is for term, let's say, between now and the end of the year. How sensitive to the current pace are your plans to open these communities if we saw the flow now persists, say, into August that felt like it was beyond normal seasonal slowdown? Would that impact your plans these communities for the end of the year? Or is that – are they a longer term two, three-year plan?
Stuart Miller: Well, on the things that we put under contract or bought, I think the only thing that might be impacted by that is the pace of starts associated with that community. With regard to opening a community, we want to get the models open. There's some seasonality associated with that depending on the market. And as in the normal flow of business we gear starts to build traffic. So I don't think it would impact the opening of the community. It might just impact what the inventory levels would be.
Rick Beckwitt: Let me just add to that and say that the new communities that we've gone out and purchased have been really targeted to micro-markets that we think are underserved, but really well-positioned. So I think it's important to keep in mind that when we see national numbers, those national numbers might be cutting an opposite way from a specific community. We think that our newer communities have been really targeted to the areas that are most likely will be able to sustain themselves even as the market might pull-back a little bit. So we expect to open all of the new communities in sequence as we're able to get them open.
Megan McGrath: Great. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up on traffic, I think you mentioned some details around your traffic. We heard from some other builders that after the tax credit, in addition to a decline in volume and traffic, the quality of the traffic was getting a little worth – in other words, it would take a little longer to translate these – those fires into – that traffic into an actual buyer. Are you experiencing the same thing at the moment?
Barclays: Great. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up on traffic, I think you mentioned some details around your traffic. We heard from some other builders that after the tax credit, in addition to a decline in volume and traffic, the quality of the traffic was getting a little worth – in other words, it would take a little longer to translate these – those fires into – that traffic into an actual buyer. Are you experiencing the same thing at the moment?
Stuart Miller: I think in the month of May, it was pretty sparse from the traffic standpoint. And all of the – I guess the – to say at the low hang and crew, it was plucked off of the tree. What we have seen in June, we have seen increased quality of traffic. And that's a really good thing for us and for the industry. It is market specific. But as you'd expect when price points go down and affordability increases, you got some people looking that really can't buy the home without getting money from some other folks to help pay for it. So we're seeing a lot of that.
Megan McGrath: Great. Thanks.
Barclays: Great. Thanks.
Stuart Miller: I think this is a good place to conclude because, look, as we look ahead and as we all monitor the market conditions that are here, it's – as I've noted in the past and I note again today, this isn't the Iraqi and sloppy bottom and stabilization process. I think that it is natural that as we go from stimulus to free market conditions taking over responsibility for that stabilization process, it gets uncomfortable. The handoff is not easy or a comfortable transition. And I think that's where we are right now. I think that there are reasons to be concerned about market conditions. But there are also reasons to see our way through, to free markets taking over and finding stability. Consumer confidence is better. The economy is – has been stabilizing. Interest rates are low. And home prices are down. And we're looking forward to seeing this market stabilize as we go forward. And with that, I'll say thank you everybody for joining us. And we look forward to talking to you about our second quarter in just a few months.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Operator: I would like to introduce your speaker for today’s call, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Mr. Miller, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you and good morning everyone. I would like to thank you first for joining us for our first quarter 2010 update. This morning, I am joined as always by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, I am joined by Rick Beckwitt, our Executive Vice President; and Jeff Krasnoff, the Chief Executive Officer of our Rialto segment. I’m going to begin this morning with some brief opening remarks about the current housing market in general and the progress we’ve made on managing our balance sheet and joint ventures. Since we have just finished our quarterly operations review with our Regional President here in Miami, Rick Beckwitt who stayed over to participate in this call will overview our homebuilding operations, while Jon Jaffe, our Chief Operating Officer is back in California. And then Jeff Krasnoff will comment on our Rialto segment positioning for 2010 and beyond. Finally, Bruce will provide additional detail on our numbers, and then we will open the phones to your questions. And as always, I would like to request that in our Q&A period, everyone please limit to just one question and one follow-up, so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. So, let me make a few overview comments about the market and our first quarter. While the new home market and housing in general still faced serious headwinds from current economic and legislative conditions, the market and overall economy appear to be continuing to stabilize and are generally in recovery. As we have expected, at least as it relates to housing, the recovery is not presenting itself as a V shape, return to better times, but instead is proving to be a rocky, stabilizing bottom with visibility obscured by more questions than clear answers. The overhang of foreclosures and the prospects of additional delinquencies ahead continued to moderate recovery, as shadow inventory continues to be absorbed and then even replenished. Unemployment and a generally sluggish economic bounce back combined to full demand at traditionally low levels. And the prospects of a pullback driven by elimination of legislative and fiscal incentives limit visibility and create pending uncertainties about the immediate future of the strength of the market. And finally, the debate over whether inflation or deflation lies ahead and the impact of sovereign credit risks add uncertainty to the view ahead of interest rate. Nevertheless, as we reviewed our operations from the field geography-by-geography, there are some common themes that appear to be validating the current trend. First, prices are not free-falling and in fact in many markets are continuing to stabilize and even recover. In most of our divisions, there continues to be a meaningful reduction in the incentives used and the sales process and that fact is reflecting itself in higher gross margins. For the company overall, incentives were 12.5%, down from 13.2% last quarter and 17.1% last year. And margins improved on a pre-impairment basis to 20.3% from 17.8% last quarter and 14.3% last year. While these trends are vulnerable to the upcoming elimination of the $8,000 tax credit and the elimination of fiscal stimulus to the lending market in the short term, it feels that the momentum provided by consumer confidence and home affordability will likely equalize their impact over a short period of time. These government programs work very well as a kick-start to a free-falling housing market, but it now seems that the free market is positioned to take over in orderly fashion. Second, inventories of new homes remains significantly reduced. While there has been a great deal of talk about potential spec building of new homes to beat the end of the tax credit, we are finding that, that as limited. In most markets, new homes are still being built to order and for the segment of the market that wants a new home, there are limited immediate opportunities to choose from, and that is helping to reduce incentives. Next, while foreclosures continue to be a significant driver of absorption and pricing, the effect is continuing to decline as the bulk of foreclosure activities is situated in areas that do not compete with new home construction, such as the inner city or the extreme outskirts of markets in which we operate. The better situated foreclosure homes are being absorbed in an orderly fashion and the market is clearly in the inventory overhang in many locations. The $8,000 tax credit has facilitated that clearing process and has helped enable a return to normalcy. In our operating meetings, we found that a number of our markets were no longer effective at all by foreclosure homes as they had already been absorbed. I have noted many times that housing is a localized business and inventories in micro markets, not broad geographic markets are most important in considering demand trends. Finally, we have heard that unemployment rates in many of our markets is at least stabilizing and in some instances beginning to recover. Accordingly, a general sense of confidence has returned to the consumer and there is a tangible sense that with prices and interest rates low, now is the right time to purchase a home for future security. This is perhaps the most important element driving the future of the housing markets as the threat of losing one’s job has deterred many from the housing market for some time now. With the ground now firming beneath us, and with solid foundation of our balance sheet, we are able to find new acquisitions of home sites to build new communities where homes can be delivered at responsible profit levels at today’s price level and given zero market appreciation and Rick will give further color on our operations will talk about our acquisitions. As you can see from our press release this morning, at Lennar, we have continued to position our company to return to fundamental profitability in 2010. We have made meaningful progress in preparing our company for a stabilized and ultimately recovering housing markets. That preparation is primarily reflected in our balance sheet and is now – that is now well positioned for the future. Through the end of last year, we aggressively impaired or disposed of assets that would not add to our profitability in the future. This process enabled us to both clean up our balance sheet, while maximizing the tax benefits derived from the net operating loss carry-back extension that Congress enacted last year. This in turn has enabled us to move forward with additional liquidity to make strategic purchases and to begin to add back jobs that were lost as the markets deteriorated. In the first quarter, we made meaningful investments that we believe are positioning our company for success. After a rather long four-and-a-half years of mending process, we are pleased to finally be using our cash again to invest for future profitability rather than support impaired property. Our balance sheet remains fortified with a homebuilding and Rialto debt-to-total cap ratio net of cash of 45.9% and homebuilding cash of approximately 1.15 billion, which includes the 230 [ph] in cash taken in two days after the end of the quarter. The number of joint ventures has fallen to 58 currently and that’s down from 62 last quarter. Many of the remaining ventures are good ventures that have already been reworked and have solid access to the position for the future. We expect to continue to reduce this number as we go forward into 2010. Additionally, we have continued to reduce our maximum recourse debt for the company to $279 million. Finally, on the opportunity side, we have made our first strategic investments in the Rialto segment of our business. As I noted in prior quarters, we have been preparing to be a significant participant in the distress opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles. We have been incubating and operating team of experienced professionals for the past few years. The team is now formed and we have begun the process of actively investing in unique distressed investments. Mid-quarter, we announced the acquisition of over $3 billion of face value of loan in partnership with the FDIC, and we described our progress no our PPIP program with AllianceBernstein. While I will let Jeff Krasnoff update you on those programs, I will note that we have made meaningful investments that we believe will add significant shareholder value. This is a tough business, but we do it exceptionally well. Yesterday evening, we had our weakly asset managers meeting, and as I reviewed assets with our managers from around the country, I was enthusiastic to see just how comfortably we operate and manage this very unique segment. We are clearly beginning to see more opportunities present themselves in this area and with our unique expertise, we expect to be an active participant in this part of the market recovery, as we feel these investments can add outsized return to our recovering homebuilding operations. At the end of the day, we are very pleased with the progress that we have made to date and the very exciting position that our company is currently in. Our balance sheet is strong and positioned with adequate liquidity to support investment for our future. Our core homebuilding operations are positioned for success and beginning to grow again, adding communities and leveraging our right-sized overhead. And our Rialto Investments segment is now fully operational and investing capital to create strong returns as we build profitability. While we have recognized that the current economic environment is fragile at best, we feel today that we are extremely well positioned to navigate the rocky bottom and ultimate recovery that lies ahead. With that, let me turn it over to Rick Beckwitt to give you color on our homebuilding operations.
Rick Beckwitt: Thanks Stuart. During our Regional Presidents’ meeting yesterday, we reviewed the operating performance and market position of our 24 homebuilding divisions. While there is always room for improvement, I am pleased to say that the homebuilding group as a whole in 75% of our division are exceeding business plans for the first quarter. Our actual performance exceeded internal plans in several categories, be it gross margins, SG&A, operating income, or new sales order. Across the board, our divisions are positioned in 2010 for substantial improvement over last year. We have home designs and floor plans that are positioned for success in this extremely price-sensitive and value-oriented markets. More importantly, our unrelenting focus on value engineering, construction costs, and cycle times has enabled us to reduce our per foot build costs to levels we haven’t seen in over a decade. With that in mind, I would like to drill down and give you some additional color on our individual markets. Keep in mind as I discuss the current market trends that even some of the weakest markets, we are in some of the most recent troubled markets, we are positioned to make money given our reduced SG&A, low cost plans, and the new land deals we have signed in these distressed areas. Let’s start in Florida. The strongest markets in Florida are Miami-Dade, parts of Broward, Sarasota, Naples, Orlando and Tampa. These markets affirm due to increased affordability. Foreclosures and resell listings on the MLS are down significantly in each of these markets. We have seen increased traffic and have been able to increase prices or reduce sales. In addition, new sales for community are in the rise. There are different things driving the improvement in each of these markets, be it the lack of entry level product in Miami-Dade, the return of value-oriented out-of-state second-time buyers in Sarasota County, active adult buyers scenting a low point in pricing in Naples, or increased financing available for foreign buyers in Orlando. We are extremely well positioned in each of these markets. Despite the huge overhang of high-rise condo product in Miami, the single family size market is doing extremely well. The weakest markets in Florida continue to be Palm Beach, Port St. Lucie, Fort Myers, although we have seen some recent stabilization in Fort Myers. Unemployment foreclosures in resells will cause these markets to take a while to recover. Most of the builders in these markets have gone bust or left the market. This has created a unique opportunity of us to do extremely well in a troubled market. In the Mid-Atlantic, Maryland and Virginia are some of the best markets in the country, notwithstanding the poor recent weather there in those markets. These markets bounced back quickly, with government spending in the region. We have been able to increase prices in both markets with Maryland as a much more price-sensitive markets than Virginia. New Jersey is a very stable market. It’s blind constrained with no foreclosures or resale issues, and we have been able to slowly increase pricing and absorption. We have a strong active adult position in this market and it has performed extremely well. The Carolinas are a mixed bag. Charlotte is a tough market with 13% unemployment, tied foreclosures and a large number of homes on the MLS. The market is very volatile with pricing continuing to edge down. We don’t see that market returning until the banking sector starts to revive. Raleigh on the other hand is an extremely hot market. Foreclosures have been absorbed by the market and resales are decreasing. We have seen strong traffic and have been able to increase pricing. Our team in Raleigh is at the top of their game. Myrtle Beach is in the early stages of recovery and Charleston have seen some pricing strength given the employment growth in the area. In the Mid-West, Minnesota is starting to stabilize, with Chicago continuing to be a very weak market. We have seen no signs of recovery in the Chicago market anytime soon. The labor unions have created a cost to price equation that makes this market very problematic. Fortunately, we have got a lean team in Chicago, that’s focused only on cash flow. In the Texas markets, Dallas is the weakest part of the market. Foreclosures and resales remain at elevated levels, while the banks have started to slow down foreclosures and have shifted with short sales, the market is not poised to improve until the end of 2010. That said, we are seeing good profitable sales activity in our well located communities in Dallas. Houston is the most stable part of the Texas market and our largest market. Resales and foreclosures have declined, our master plan communities are doing extremely well, and we have been able to slowly increase pricing. Austin and San Antonio have stabilized, traffic is up especially at the low price points and in the better located communities. Military spending and the troops returning to the area will continue to drive this market. In Colorado, we are starting to see real market recovery in Denver. Traffic has improved significantly with real qualified buyers. We are beginning to see some pricing power. In the desert areas, let’s talk about Arizona. Arizona continues to be soft, but it’s improving. Phoenix in better shape and Tucson at both markets, the activity is very community-specific. Traffic for the most part is flat and we have seen a modest improvement in foreclosures and resale listing. As you would expect, the lower price points are performing better than the higher and the further you get out of town, the weaker the markets go. Las Vegas is very similar to Arizona. It’s a tough market. With unemployment at 13%, the market will take some time to recover. While foreclosures and resales are trending down, pricing is extremely tough. The high end is dead and the entry level has improved. We are fortunate to have almost no legacy assets in this market and have been able to secure some incredible, new distressed deals that will make money even in this down market. In California, the well-located communities have bounced back very quickly. In the Inland Empire, there is great affordability. Our communities in Corona, Murrieta, Rancho Cucamonga, and San Bernardino are doing extremely well. But the outline areas of Hemet, Belmont, Palm Springs are lifeless. Fortunately, we had very little presence in these areas. The LA and Valencia market is improving, but they are a little softer than the Inland Empire. This area has stabilized with buyers chasing the new affordable products. Orange County, Irvine, Buena Park are pretty good markets, traffics set significantly, and we have been able to raise prices. Bakersfield and Fresno markets are still hurting, with fine impact of high unemployment, foreclosures and resales, have made this the toughest areas in California. Finally, Northern California, the Bay Area is extremely strong, while Sacramento is still sluggish. While it’s off to close, Sacramento won’t see a meaningful growth until the state government starts to grow as well. But as in other soft markets, our downsized product and restructured operations will allow us to be profitable in this market. I hope that gives you a better read of how things are geographically and how market and community-specific this recovery truly is. Neighboring and micro markets have completely different prospects. In that context, I would like to now focus on our land acquisition strategy. We have been extremely active pursuing new land opportunities since the beginning of 2009. Our primary focus has been on finished home sites that we can acquire on an auction-basis, with little or no upfront deposits. As you can imagine the financial returns from these low risks, properly priced deals are extremely attractive due to the short time between the time we buy the land and when we deliver the homes. Recently, we have used our balance sheet to cash some distressed opportunities that provide significant margins. These purchases range from buying land directly from banks, cash-strapped developers and builders for closure sales, short sales and even backing into assets by purchasing loans directly or by acquiring CDD obligations. Yesterday Stuart and I reviewed each new land deal we had signed since the beginning of 2009. All of these deals were underwritten with extremely conservative assumptions. It assumes no price increases, slow sales phase and with price to yield gross margins and IRRs exceeding 20%. I am pleased to report that almost all of these deals are exceeding underwriting. Our underwriting and review process is extremely tight. Jon and I are reviewing every transaction and no money leaves this company without a thumbs up from me, Jon, or Stuart. In the last quarter, we were very opportunistic and selective with our new transactions. We put under contract approximately 4,000 home sites located in 73 new communities. While I can’t give you too much color on all of these deals, I can tell you that they are all high margin opportunities. As you can imagine, our focus is to leverage our existing operations and take advantage of the market distress. I would like to highlight one of the more interesting deals we put together in the last quarter. We have a great working relationship with Starwood Capital. They were selected as the stalking-horse bidder for TOUSA’s Florida assets in the bankruptcy process. These landholdings constituted one of the most desirable real estate portfolios to come to market in the years. We worked with Starwood to create a truly win-win transaction. We helped Starwood underwrite these assets in exchange for an auction to purchase these assets if they were the successful bidder in the bankruptcy. The great thing about the deal is we had an auction contract in place before the auction started, so that Starwood could go into the auction with precision about their financial returns and we had locked in pricing before the auction started. We are thrilled with the outcome. We now have an option to purchase 1,400 home sites located in 38 communities in Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, and southeast Florida over the next 24 months. In addition, we have secured a first offer on an additional 1,348 home sites after the 24-month period. These auctions have flexible takedown schedules, produce gross margins in excess of 20%, have IRRs north of 20% and allow us to leverage our existing SG&A to produce increased process. Before I turn it over to Jeff, I would like to thank our folks in the divisions for the hard work and focus they have had during these difficult times. It’s their attention to detail that allows us to return to profitability.
Jeff Krasnoff: Good morning. It’s been a while since I have had an opportunity to participate in one of these conference calls. It’s great to be back and thank you Stuart and Rick for the invitation. On the Rialto side, we have now been at this now for over two years, building the team here inside and alongside Lennar. And our team contains a lot of familiar faces, a number of whom who were here a couple of decades ago, but we did something very similar. We have also had an opportunity to set our systems, levering off of Lennar’s infrastructure and it’s had an opportunity to get deep into the markets, thanks to the unique view that only Lennar’s operating team could provide. We have also focused on opportunities, patiently evaluating tens of billions of dollars of distressed real estate loans securities and properties. As expected for quite some time, owners of troubled assets could not afford to part with those assets at the prices appropriate for those who might be better equipped to maximize values. So, similar to what we have seen in prior real estate downturns of this magnitude, we expect of the US government to act as a catalyst to help kick-start the clearing of assets and to create price discovery. We have initially pursued opportunities to partner with the government in programs similar to those that we saw in the early 1990s. For example, last summer, we became a sub advisor to our old friends at AllianceBernstein in the treasury’s legacy securities Public Private Investment Program or PPIP and became one of eight sponsors selected to participate. Together, we raised over $1 billion of private equity commitment that is being matched by treasury equity and advantageous match term financing from treasury. Lennar has made a $75 million commitment to that program, and just over half of that has been funded today. We also have closely watched the activities at the FDIC and as you are aware, we are now partnered with them in two entities that acquired about $3 billion of real estate loans. We worked for over four months on the underlying due diligence and because of the high content of loans made to developers, having Lennar’s unique view, we believe gave us the distinctive advantage in our evaluation of those assets. We closed the transactions with the FDIC just six weeks ago and just about completed the task of bringing all of the loans in from the 22 different receiverships. In addition, during the short time, we have already had contact with a majority of the larger borrowers, borrower meetings are going on as we speak, a few of the loans have already been resolved and are being documented and cash is being collected. We see the potential opportunity as being extremely large. Looking at the FDIC alone, there have been almost 200 banks seized during this cycle and another 700 are on the watch list. The 22 institutions included in these first few structured transactions made up over $4 billion of unpaid principal balance alone just to kind of give you a perspective for the size of this opportunity. Many of the remaining troubled institutions have loans similar to the ones in the two transactions we just closed, and we are up and running and continue to have that unique Lennar advantage. We also anticipate that our involvement in sourcing and evaluating these assets will continue to yield one-off opportunities for the Lennar homebuilding operation. The Rialto team is very excited about how we are positioned and look forward to reporting to you on our progress in future quarters. I am going to turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thank you Jeff and good morning. As we indicated in our fourth quarter conference call, we expected a first quarter loss due to low projected deliveries. For the quarter, we reported a loss of $0.04 per diluted share compared with a $0.98 loss per share in the prior year. Revenues from home sales decreased 2% to $513 million. That was due to a 7% decrease in home deliveries excluding JVs, partially offset by a 6% increase in the average sales price to $258,000. The overall average sales price increase was partially due to a larger percent of deliveries from California. The average sales price changed regionally year-over-year as follows. The east region was $229,000, up 2%; the central region was $208,000, up 7%; the west region was $375,000, up 8%; Houston was $213,000, up 10%; and the other category was $255,000, down 12%. Our pre-impairment gross margin improvement to 20.3% compared to 14.3% in the prior year was driven by a couple of items. Primarily it was due to a significant reduction in sales incentives of $14,000 per home as it declined from $51,000 in the prior year’s quarter to $37,000 per home in this quarter. So, that was a reduction from 17.1% of home sales to 12.5% in the current quarter. The lower sales incentives per home is the result of the improved selling environment, our repositioned product strategy as well as fewer completed unsold homes. Additionally, our gross margins were favorably impacted from the progress in reducing construction costs per square foot that Rick talked about. Turning to impairment, we had a very significant reduction in impairments this quarter. It was 10.1 million compared with 88.5 million in the prior year and approximately half of that number in the current year was related to homebuilding-related impairments. We are now realizing the benefits from our aggressive cost-cutting measures, as we reduced SG&A costs by $20 million or 20% year-over-year. SG&A as a percentage of revenue from home sales was 15.8%, which decreased 360 basis points from the prior year and 40 basis points sequentially from our fourth quarter. Our financial services segment had a small loss of 900,000 versus 492,000 of costs last year as a result of lower volumes in both our mortgage and title operations. Mortgage pretax was a profit of 2.9 million versus 6.2 million in the prior year and our title company reduced its loss to 3.4 million versus 5 million in the prior year’s quarter. Turning to the Rialto segment, with the investments we made this quarter in Rialto, we wanted to provide investors full transparency and we established a new – it was $1 million operating loss during the quarter compared with $600,000 in the prior year. Revenues during the quarter included $300,000 for PPIP advisory fees. There were no revenues recorded during the quarter relating to the partnership with FDIC, as most of the loans acquired had not been transferred from the FDIC’s existing servicers prior to the end of the first quarter. Our investment in the FDIC partnership will begin contributing to revenue in the second quarter. We did recognize 1.4 million of expenses in this segment in the first quarter, and these were costs for due diligence costs in connection with the acquisition of the real estate loan portfolios and the partnership with FDIC as well as Rialto general and administrative expenses. We also recognized $143,000 of equity in earnings which is primarily our investment in PPIP, as Jeff mentioned, we actually invested $41 million of our $75 million PPIP investment commitment throughout the first quarter. We recognized a tax benefit during the quarter of approximately $12 million and this related to a reversal of the state tax item that we provided in adopting FIN 48 back on December 1st of 2007. This item was recorded in 2007, because it did not meet the more likely than not standard required by FIN 48, and in the first quarter, we reached an agreement with the state resulting in its reversal. In the first quarter, we continued with a strong balance sheet, and while we strategically invested approximately $0.5 billion between new land acquisitions and Rialto investments, we still focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Stuart mentioned the combination of our homebuilding cash, restricted cash and tax receivables totaled 1.15 billion at quarter end and the tax receivable we talked about in our fourth quarter came in two pieces, 92 million came in during the quarter and the remainder 230 million was actually received on March 2nd. We terminated the company’s credit facility in February and we entered into cash collateralized Letter of Credit facilities which will result in 8 million of annual savings. Our leverage remained low as our homebuilding and Rialto’s debt-to-total capital amount of cash was 45.9%, and we also retired 90 million of homebuilding debt during the quarter, with the majority of this debt having a maturity that came due in 2010. We continued to carefully manage our inventory as we reduced wholly-owned completed unsold homes year-over-year from 1,321 to 572. We closed on approximately 3,300 home sites during the quarter, totaling 154 million of new land acquisitions. Inventory declined from 3.9 billion in the prior year to 3.6 billion in the current quarter, and that excludes consolidated inventory not owned. We had just over 3,000 starts during the quarter, which was up 46% year-over-year, and there were 83,000 home sites owned and 21,000 controlled at quarter-end, totaling 104,000 owned and controlled. Of the remaining 58 joint ventures that Stuart mentioned, only 21 have recourse debt, 15 have non-recourse debt and 22 have new debt. Additionally, we reduced our maximum recourse indebtedness to 279 million at the end of the quarter and our recourse net of reimbursement agreement fell to 186 million. We continue to be successful in extending joint venture loans upon maturity as we extended an additional six during the quarter. In our first quarter, there was new accounting standard 810 that requires companies to include minatory interest in equity, and as a result, we included 544 million of non-controlling interest in the equity section of our balance sheet. In conclusion, the company is financially strong and our strategies have positioned us well. Our operating margins are at the highest level in four years, with a strong improvement in our gross margins. Our sales incentives are at the lowest percent of home sales since 2006. Impairments were reduced by about 90% during the quarter. Our SG&A is now right sized and has declined as a percentage of home sales, even though home sales declined. Our backlog is up 34%, that’s the largest year-over-year in percent increase since 2002. Additionally, our cancellation rate of 13% is the lowest we have seen in many years. We will see positive contributions from the new land acquisitions that Rick talked about as new communities open and as Jeff’s crew continues to work through the FDIC investment that we made in the first quarter, Rialto will begin contributing revenues from the FDIC partnership in the second quarter. We are clearly on our way back to profitability. With that, let me turn it over for questions.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS. Your line is open.
David Goldberg – UBS: Thanks, good afternoon everybody.
Stuart Miller: It’s still morning, David.
David Goldberg – UBS: That’s almost noon.
Stuart Miller: Right.
David Goldberg – UBS: Not bad. The first question I wanted to talk a little bit about was, if we could talk about buyer quality, I am nearly trying to get an idea if you are seeing any follow-off in buyer quality in terms of groups coming into the community as a factor of kind of where it is on, I mean, you have seen, FICO scores coming down and all, you have seen LTVs increase, and how do you kind of think about with the tax credit, maybe we just pull forward too much demand and what’s left out there in your market?
Rick Beckwitt: This is Rick, I will take this one. With regard to the quality of the bars coming through the community, I would say it has remained relatively high. Folks out there are not just shopping or looking for furniture, they are looking to buy a home, those prices are in the affordable range. Credit score has really varied dramatically by market. So, it would be tough to really give you an overall view as to whether they are on the rise or on the fall because they really vary by market. With regard to the tax credit accelerating demand, we think some demand has been accelerated, there is no question of that, because there is a follow-off between when they get that opportunity back from the government, but it’s really difficult to assess, you know, what the impact of the elimination of that is going to be.
David Goldberg – UBS: Got it. Quick follow-up question here, are you guys seeing more opportunities for M&A with private builders as a way to access land and maybe pricing becoming more reasonable on those opportunities?
Rick Beckwitt: It might be out there, David, but it’s not our focus right now. We are really looking for kind of off-the-beaten-path opportunities. We don’t want to go into the head-to-head environment. You know, there is still lot of developed home site opportunities out there that are either on the market or have not yet hit the market, and right now, we are finding organic ways to expand our footprint within our operating divisions, leveraging overheads, one real carefully underwritten deal at a time.
David Goldberg – UBS: All right. Thanks very much, have a good morning.
Rick Beckwitt: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill, Zelman & Associates. Your line is open.
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: Good morning everybody.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: First question, just with some of the macro numbers that are both around on the new home sales side, it’s not a data point, we have put a lot of – but can you just talk about the orders in the quarter and how it’s trended relative to your expectations and any color you can provide on March as well would be helpful?
Stuart Miller: Throughout the quarter, you know, first of all, Dennis, we generally don’t give the mid-quarter update, but throughout the quarter, I think you will note that it followed the typical seasonal trend. December tends to be a little slower, because you have the holidays, and it starts to pick up as you get closer to the Super Bowl and I would say that has followed the typical seasonal trend.
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: And that trend relative to your expectations was larger in line?
Stuart Miller: Yes, it was absolutely in line.
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: Okay. And then secondly, just as we talk about some of the lot opportunities that you have capitalized on, can you scale what you put either under contract or officially closed on realized let’s say five quarters or so relative to the whole 104,000 lots that you control?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, clearly, the margins in the more recent transactions, deals that we have signed or actually have closed on are much stronger than the totality of the balance. We have been taking advantage of the distress that’s out there. And you will start to see, you know, the benefit of the margins associated with those deals as we increase the building activity.
Stuart Miller: But with that in mind, we have been very regimented in how we deal with our existing inventory and as you know, we were early to the game with regard to taking the appropriate impairments and we have seen that move through the system.
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: I guess what I am trying to get a size of the percentage of the lots that would fall in that first category of lots?
Stuart Miller: I don’t think we have it broken out, but I guess the newer home sites are increasing. It’s probably closer to 10% of the total now. But we are clearly depleting some of the older communities and replacing with newer well-positioned higher gross margin communities and that’s a trend.
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: Okay, that’s helpful. Good luck guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay, thanks Dennis.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Joshua Pollard, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning.
Operator: Joshua, you may need to un-mute your lines.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: There you go, mute button is working very well. Thank you. My first question is on the FDIC, I am ultimately trying to understand how revenues will ramp up in Rialto in addition to try to ultimately understand how the cost will ramp up there as well, it’s pretty clear. You guys that have the senior management team sort of compensation there, but as the revenue start to ramp through as you guys get some more cash from those loans, what should we be thinking about as far as modeling that out?
Stuart Miller: Well, let me start with the cost side. We are, you know, first of all looking at the growth of that business as having, as we buy or participate in new acquisitions and investment opportunities embedded in these deals is an offset of the cost side. So, there is a fee structure in just about any investment that we are making and each investment should be paying for itself on a current basis as we go. So, for example, the FDIC deal has a fee structure that will be funded from current cash flows that we are very comfortable, are already there and will continue to be there. And that will be a direct offset to the overhead that is incurred. You know, there might be a minor adjustment one way or the other, but by and large, the deals will pay for themselves. In terms of the ramp up of revenues and profitability, you know, it’s always been that, that business is not modeled above the income and the resolution of assets in that business happen, I hate to say it this way kind of as they happen, but what we do envision is while overhead will be basically a zero or covered, we think that profitability will ramp up as we move forward. We generally find that as we touch and get involved in more and more of a loan portfolio, the resolution has happened in orderly course. And so, there will be a trajectory, but I don’t think that we can put our hands on a metric that gives us visibility, if they have quarter-by-quarter, those profits will come in.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, the other side of that question is, I was out in California talking with some of your competitors where the FDIC step in, and the deal that they have won, you know, they sort of comment that the moment you get the (inaudible) there is a group of folks who write upfront up in the fed, hey, I would like to pay my loan off, I hadn’t been able to find anyone to work through this loan with, that there is a good chunk of dealing that happened in the first couple of weeks or months. Are you guys experiencing that upfront? And then my last sort of follow-up is for Bruce and maybe Stuart, the cash balance has come down pretty drastically, not that it’s a bad thing, because you guys won that here, but I would like to know, you know, sort of what you guys want to keep on the balance sheet at this point of the cycle?
Stuart Miller: Okay, to add to the first question, the first part, let’s say and we call it all one question.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Stuart Miller: But as to the first part, we are definitely activity as we start to speak to borrowers, and the activity is that people say I haven’t had someone to speak to, we like the payoff, but you have to temper the enthusiasm around that with some borrowers will say, we haven’t had someone to speak to and we wanted to pay off and then dot, dot, dot, at a discount. You know, there is a process involved here, and everybody would like a big discount and then maybe a little less of a discount, and the question is getting to the right number, so it takes a little bit of time even where people have been anxious to speak to someone. So, it’s a process we have a lot of experience with us, and we know that as time goes forward, we are going to see more and more resolution at proper numbers. As it relates to the depletion of cash, as I said in my comments, it’s gratifying to be again investing capital in profitable opportunities for the future and we think that’s the mandate of the company. And so, as we look at our cash balance we invested as opposed to depleted, we are positively inclined towards that. I don’t think that it is in ours or our investors’ best interest to have a great deal of cash in our books earning 1% or less, and so, we are looking for strategic investment opportunities. To deploy capital, you are seeing some of that happened in the first quarter. We are looking at as we look ahead at opportunities to deploy more of that capital while we maintain adequate reserves to fund our ongoing operations, now recognizing that we have eliminated our revolver in this past quarter.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: There used to be sort of 40% to 45% net debt-to-cap ratios that you guys sort of got it to or at least the industry got it too, you guys are sitting there now as – is that something that you guys are focused on or not right here?
Stuart Miller: Yes, we have always tried to stay in kind of a range around that level recognizing that the Rialto investment is a large consolidated venture that has moved the needle there and under normal circumstances would not have. So, we think that we are comfortably in that range, especially as we in our own mind kind of take out that large debt component, non-recourse debt component that’s associated with that.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: You are welcome.
Bruce Gross: And Josh, let me just say that, remember, as you are looking our debt to total capital, we have a $650 million deferred tax asset reserve that we do expect to come back into equity over the next four quarters give or take a quarter.
Joshua Pollard – Goldman Sachs & Co.: Four quarters, that’s relatively quick. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Hi good morning. I had a couple of questions on margins, both on a gross side and on the cost side. On the gross margin, how much of the $10 million impairment was in homebuilding cost of goods sold? I am just trying to get to a pre-impairment homebuilding gross margin this quarter. And then on the cost side, I was wondering both on the SG&A and on the corporate, you know, there is a significant downtick both sequentially year-over-year, so I was wondering how sustainable that was, if that’s kind of a new run rate do you think that is anything one-time in there?
Bruce Gross: Let me respond to the first question. We actually gave the pre-impairment margins, that was the 20.3%.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Okay.
Bruce Gross: So, just over half of the $10 million related to homebuilding and relative to the second question as far as the SG&A run rate, we have really taken quite a few hits over the past number of quarters relating to lease terminations, we have had legal expenses, so a lot of those were non-recurring costs. And as volume picks up as we expected to, we do expect to get leverage on our SG&A as a percentage of home sales as we go forward.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Great, thank you. And then one housekeeping question, did you give, if you did, I missed it, the community count?
Bruce Gross: I did mention the community count was flattish with last quarter. Now, that doesn’t include some of the recent acquisitions that we made because we don’t add to community account until we open it for sales.
Adam Rudiger – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Ray – JP Morgan: Hi guys, it’s actually Ray [ph] calling in for Mike. First question on the, just trying to drill down on the comments about 2010 profitability, you know, obviously the gross margins are seeing a pretty nice trajectory here up to 20.3% ex-charges. I was wondering if you had any guidance for 2010 on a quarterly basis, you know, if you expect that to continue to be up pretty solid here, year-over-year and maybe on a sequential basis versus the first quarter, you know, how you see that trending throughout the year?
Stuart Miller: We haven’t provided the quarterly guidance, but we are still comfortable that we will be profitable, we expect to be profitable for all of 2010. And I think if you listen to some of the comments that were made, a lot of the newer communities are opening maybe spring and into the middle part of this year with more deliveries in the back end of the year, and I think the contribution from Rialto will be greater as the year continues. So, I would expect that the second half of the year will have a greater percentage of adding to that profitability, we expect for this year.
Ray – JP Morgan: Okay. And then kind of just follow-up on that, given that you know, the tax credit expire in April, what are you guys doing in terms of a spec management and you know, is that higher level of specs in the second quarter potentially going to you know, kind of offset that gross margin permit at all?
Bruce Gross: Well, as you can imagine with the initiation of the tax credit and the expiration of it, we have really geared our inventory position and start schedule to fall within the hash marks of those two days. Right now, we are not carrying what I would say is a large level of spec to the inventory. We are really focused on trying to do build to sell side of opportunity to pre-sell. We are actually accomplishing some, what I call in the business sales right now, and that we feel relatively comfortable with our inventory.
Stuart Miller: Yes, let me just add to that and say that we know that there is a lot of enthusiasm of the end of the $8,000 tax credit. We have not allowed ourselves to get caught up in spec building in anticipation of its end. We think that, you know, with a slightly longer-term view that the end of that program is going to come in orderly fashion and not the quite as dramatic as some might think it will be.
Ray – JP Morgan: Okay. I appreciate that. Just one last question, I think you guys talked about the trends in the first quarter, but just wondering, I am not sure if you guys answered whether if you could get different color for what’s happened so far in the second quarter?
Stuart Miller: Traditionally and today as well, we just don’t, we don’t speak to any inner quarter results and we will just have to wait and see when we have our call at the end of the second quarter.
Ray – JP Morgan: All right. Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Josh Levin of Citi. Your line is open. 
Josh Levin – Citi: Yes, good morning everybody.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Josh Levin – Citi: I wanted to revisit the question of what happens to demand when the tax cut goes away, but have you seen any specific trends in the past few weeks that gave you an insight to this question for example, are you seeing a shift away from preorder homes that may not close in time to qualify to spec homes that would actually close and qualify?
Rick Beckwitt: Well, with regard to people coming in, I think a lot of that depends on what their urgency factor is for a homeowner, to the extent that they are a relo buyer and moving to the market they want something to move into today to the extent that they have got more flexibility and want to have the specific home site in the community. They are more focused on the location and products than they are necessarily to tax credit. I think you need to keep in mind that affordability is at such a level in today’s market that you know, after the fact, rebate from the government, it’s not necessarily driving the purchase decision. And we are confident that, you know, over the long term, the elimination of the tax credit is not going to have a significant – not going to cause significant issues for us, and you know, depending on the type and the part of the market, people aren’t really even focused on the tax credit. It’s a nice thing to get but it’s not driving the decision.
Josh Levin – Citi: Okay. Different topic, do you have a sense of how the healthcare reform legislation is going to affect Lennar? Some business that are out there talking about incremental costs and have you guys done any internal work on this or just too early to know?
Stuart Miller: I just think it’s too early to know right now, Josh. I don’t think that, I think there is too much up in the air. So, I would just have to say not sure yet.
Josh Levin – Citi: Okay. Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is coming from Steven East, Ticonderoga Securities. Your line is open.
Steven East – Ticonderoga Securities: Thank you, good morning guys.
Stuart Miller: Hi Steven.
Steven East – Ticonderoga Securities: Bruce, in fact, to ask you on the accounting rule change, all of that minority interest that came along to your balance sheet, will the benefits accrue to Lennar or if not is there some type of counter accountant sitting out there? I guess what I am trying to understand is, is this is a real bob to book value or not?
Bruce Gross: Well, the way I would look at the accounting change, Steven, just really simplify it is the line that was between liabilities and equity is now just in the equity section, that’s the only change that occurred.
Steven East – Ticonderoga Securities: Okay, so just a reclassification, that’s it?
Bruce Gross: Exactly, just moved down essentially one line till it’s under equity where it used to be no man’s land between liabilities and equity.
Steven East – Ticonderoga Securities: Okay, I get that. And then the second thing for you all, on the financial services, are you seeing any increase in reserves and warranties for loans coming back etcetera?
Bruce Gross: No, we have not in the first quarter. As you look at our first quarter results for financial services, it’s always a low volume quarter for us and we did see a reduction in refinances and just low volume, but there were no reserves in the first quarter that we had to take.
Steven East – Ticonderoga Securities: Okay, and then just a last question, you talked about on the SG&A, some of the legal expenses etcetera, any update on the Chinese dry wall where you stand with that, is that an issue that’s pretty much behind you or from a cost perspective announced just a case of essentially getting recovery coming back to you all, in a situation?
Bruce Gross: If you remember at year-end, we had accrued for expected additional homes that we might try are affected with Chinese dry wall and we had an accrual that was approximately 80 million. So, that accrual not only that we believe at this time that, that was sufficient for what might still come to our attention as affected homes, but in addition, the receivable that we set up, we have been collecting from the insurance company under that receivable, and we feel comfortable that it’s behind us now.
Steven East – Ticonderoga Securities: All right. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jonathan Ellis, Banc of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Jonathan Ellis – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you. My first question is about, you mentioned California or the west having an impact on average pricing this quarter, and could you talk a little bit about what actually caused the upside in deliveries in that region and why that’s not necessarily going to continue for the balance of the year?
Stuart Miller: Well, we sold more homes. Markets are recovering. There’s been an increased demand in the market, you know, the housing has gotten into a point where prices are very affordable and you are seeing the net impact of that close through the system. The delivered price was up because that was an increased part of our overall mix. You know, we are very, very well positioned in California, and it’s going to be interesting to see how the balance of the year goes. Stay tuned.
Jonathan Ellis – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. My other question is, if you could talk a little bit, you mentioned the land purchases this quarter. Can you provide us with a target for the full year in terms of land spend and then also sort of a related question is, in terms of community count, any expectations that you would like to provide in terms of community count as of the end of this coming year?
Stuart Miller: I think our best instinct is really to more on what we have accomplished and leave open the questions of where we go from here. I think we are taking very opportunistic view of all of our investment opportunities and really trying to stay very close to the market conditions as they evolve. As I noted, it’s a pretty rocky bottom here. So, we are going to see what happens on a month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter basis and not try to project that.
Jonathan Ellis – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Maybe just a clarifying question though, in terms of the community count, are you anticipating scaling up over the course of the year just directionally?
Bruce Gross: Well, fairly the new communities that we brought on board are going to work their way into our community count as the year progresses. You know, we will have some communities that those are replacing, but I think it’s safe to say that the community count at the end of 2010 will be larger than it was at the beginning of ’09 [ph], at the beginning of the year.
Jonathan Ellis – Banc of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks guys.
Bruce Gross: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank: Thanks. I wanted to ask about kind of strategic thoughts behind the FDIC portfolio purchase. Now, you folks laid it out pretty well in terms of the circumstances out there with regards to all the regional banks, obviously there have been many more bank failures and many more that are on the watch list. And the portfolios that you folks purchased are among the first to be released in large scale. So, in terms of the kind of strategic thinking there, does that tell us that you think that the first move on these distressed portfolios was the best one that may be, there would be a lot more competition for subsequent portfolios, or does it tell us something more along the lines of, this is just the first of our purchases and there maybe others to come.
Stuart Miller: Yes, look, we have been underwriting portfolios for the past two years. Jeff has mobilized the team, and I don’t know, maybe I should let Jeff speak a little bit, take it first. Jeff has mobilized the team that has been operating in this space for quite some time. The way you should look at our purchase is not that the first mover is an important position because in fact, we have underwritten a number of portfolios and we have either just decided not to bid or we have not been a winning bidder for the past couple of years. What you should read it as is that pricing is starting to find its way to a point where acquisitions can be made, proper management applied and profits will naturally come from that. And that means that you have two things happening, pricing is coming down to an appropriate level, and you have what we call price-enabled sellers. That means a seller who is actually able to trade at the price where the market is willing to buy. The government obviously is price-enabled and can sell at an appropriate level. Some of the banks have been reluctant or incapable of selling at those levels, even now getting to a point where the market has identified an appropriate price where buyers will buy and be able to make a profit. We have a great deal of expertise in this area. Our underwriting has been thorough in all of the portfolios we have underwritten. We have a great deal of confidence that what we are purchasing, we are going to be able to add some real value as the management team and make some good decisions that will yield us to good profit.
Jeff Krasnoff: Yes, this is Jeff, and I think the only thing I would add to that is the fact that you know these are really sort of the first of the acquisition development instruction type of portfolios as well, and we believe we have sort of the unique approach to that, because it does require a lot of infrastructure in order to be able to number one, just underwrite it, but also work it out after the fact and having that – and having Lennar’s footprint across the country, puts us in a great position to be able to bid on these. So, I think you had all of those things beginning to come together at one time. The pricing, the type of portfolio, the team that we put together, so on so forth, all sort of aligned.
Stuart Miller: And let me, wait, let me just say one more thing, Nishu, but the other thing to note is I don’t feel like there is a first mover advantage so much. I just don’t think that there are a lot of competitors for this business. This is a tough business that takes a great deal of expertise. You can’t just decided to get into this business and start buying some assets. It is a complex business that requires that really knows what it’s doing. So, rather than being a first mover, we know that we have the advantage of being a very unique team in this business and the fact that we are finding prices that makes sense is what’s more significant.
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank: Is the capacity of the Rialto team consumed pretty much completely by the portfolios you have already brought or is it you know, it wouldn’t or if there is room, to do more deals in the near term.
Jeff Krasnoff: I would say there is a lot of room, you know, from an instructor perspective and from a team perspective, there is a lot of room to expand and to do more. We have got the base and we have had the last couple of years really to put together really a great team here. And adding additional personnel as necessary on top of the existing infrastructure and so on, we believe is, I mean, again it’s all hard work, but we believe it’s something that we are pretty adapted doing and we have done it in the past.
Stuart Miller: Yes, we have done this before and we scaled from zero to 4 billion overtime. So, we have got a history of knowing how the scaling process works, and I think that we have a lot of capacity here.
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank: Thanks and a capacity for Bruce, in terms of, just following up on something that Joshua asked earlier. You said something that surprised me a little bit that the differed tax asset could come back on to the balance sheet, within I believe you said 12 months. I just wanted to get an understanding of how we can kind of analyze that from the outside. Is it going to be a one-time event, in other words, that you trigger some type of threshold and the entire $600 million plus balance comes back on. Is it going to come back on scale and what metric should we be thinking about from the outside, the timing and the flow of that?
Jeff Krasnoff: Well, these are the exact questions that the homebuilders are discussing with their auditors and it’s not perfectly clear. So, you have to keep in mind we don’t have perfect guidance from the accounting firms, but essentially once you have a year give or take of profitability and that profitability will continue. It’s like that you could have the discussion about taking in your tax asset reserve, and because of the way the reserve is embedded in the assets, it’s likely to come all at one time as opposed to in various components.
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks a lot.
Stuart Miller: Okay, and we will take one more question please.
Operator: And the next question is from Dan Oppenheim, Credit Suisse. Your line is open. 
Dan Oppenheim – Credit Suisse: Thanks very much. You talked about the inspection thing, haven’t gotten carried away with the first time visit home, our tax credit here. Can you just give some quantification in terms of spec levels right now on a per community basis?
Bruce Gross: Our spec levels on a per community basis, and I could jump in and answer that, Dan, it’s running approximately one to two per community as far as completed unsold homes go.
Dan Oppenheim – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then second question, you talked a lot about the complexity of it in the expertise, getting critical mass, and having a lot of capacity there, what is your thought in terms of when you would like to really step up into that, how the way that you see opportunities would we see lot more activity coming in the next several quarters here or will that be more measured?
Stuart Miller: I don’t think, I don’t think we can think in terms of the next couple of quarters. It’s a very opportunistic consideration, Dan. The bids come up, bids are put out there. Some of them are one, some of them are just taken off the agenda. We continue to be very involved in the bidding process here. And we are – we have a fair amount of difference as to whether we are investing over the next month, quarter or year, we are going to be an active participant and be investing in this business for the next years to come. So, I can’t really give you any color as to what we think is going to be a ramp up and what the timing will be, but we are actively involved right now.
Dan Oppenheim – Credit Suisse: Thank you so much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. I want to thank everybody for joining us. We are pretty enthusiastic about where we are right now. We recognized that the current economic environment is turbulent and with that recognition and humble respect for the market conditions, we think that we are well positioned to be able to move forward. So, we look forward to reporting again the end of our second quarter. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today’s conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your speaker for today’s call, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Mr. Miller, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and year end ’09 update. I’m joined here as always this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Additionally, since we’ve just finished our two day operations review of all of our divisions here in Miami, John Jaffe and Rick Beckwitt are here as well, and since John and Rick run our day-to-day operations in the field, I’m going to begin with some brief opening remarks about the current housing market in general and the progress we’ve made on managing our balance sheet and joint ventures. Then Rick and John will comment on our homebuilding operations and positioning for 2010 and beyond. And finally Bruce will provide some additional detail on our numbers, and then of course we’ll open the phones to your questions.  And as always I’d like to request that in our Q&A period that everybody please limit to just one question and one follow up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. So now let me just make a few overview comments about the market and our fourth quarter. Overall the market and the overall economy appear to be in recovery. As we have expected, at least as it relates to housing, this recovery is not presenting itself as a V-shaped return to better times but instead is proving to be a rocky, stabilizing bottom with visibility obscured by more questions than clear answers. Nevertheless, as we reviewed our operations in the field, geography by geography, there are some common themes that appear to be forming a trend. Prices are no longer free falling downward and in fact in many instances are actually starting to stabilize and even recover. In most of our divisions there has been a meaningful reduction in the incentives used in the sales process and that’s reflected itself in higher margins. For the company overall, incentives were $36,300 down from $42,200 last quarter and $51,400 last year. And margins improved to 17.8% from 15.6% last quarter and 17% last year. I feel comfortable today saying that this is a trend and not an anomaly. Inventories of new homes are significantly reduced. In most markets, new homes are being built to order and for the segment of the market that wants a new home there are limited immediate opportunities to choose from and that’s helping reduce incentives.  We also heard from the field that while foreclosures continue to be a significant driver of absorption and pricing, the effect is actually declining as the bulk of foreclosure activity is either in inner city locations or the extreme outskirts of markets in which we operate. The better situated foreclosure homes are being absorbed in an orderly fashion, and the market is clearing the inventory overhang in many locations. The $8,000 tax credit that was thankfully extended by Congress is facilitating that clearing process and will help enable a return to normalcy when the credit expires in the spring. We heard that a general sense of confidence has returned to the customer and that there is a tangible sense that with prices and interest rates low, now is the right time to purchase a home for future security. This sentiment is driving many new purchasers to the market and traffic is slowly improving. This reflected itself in our first year-over-year increase in new orders since our first quarter of 2006. We also heard from our division presidents that the unemployment rate in most of their markets has stopped falling and is at least stabilizing and in some instances beginning to recover. This is perhaps the most important element in driving future confidence as the threat of losing ones job has deterred many from the housing market for some time now.  Finally, we heard that we are able to find new acquisitions of home sites to build new communities where homes can be delivered at a responsible profit level at today’s prices and given zero market appreciation. John will give further color on our operations while Rick will talk through some of those acquisitions. As you can see from our press release this morning, at Lennar we’ve closed out 2009 by preparing our company to return to fundamental profitability. We’ve continued to make meaningful progress in preparing our company for stabilized and ultimately recovering housing market. That preparation is primarily reflected in our balance sheet that is now well positioned for the future. We aggressively impaired or disposed of assets that would not add to our profitability in the future. This process enabled us to both clean up our balance sheet while maximizing the tax benefit derived from the net operating loss carry back extension that Congress enacted last year. This in turn enables us to move forward with additional liquidity to make strategic purchases and to begin to add back jobs that were lost as the market [inaudible]. As we enter 2010, our balance sheet is fortified with a debt to total capital ratio net of homebuilding cash of 36.9% and homebuilding cash of $1.3 billion with no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. Additionally, we expect to recover an additional $320 million in cash refund in early 2010 from the net operating loss carry back provision. This positions our company very well to make the strategic investments that are desirable as we begin to grow again. On the joint venture front we have again meaningfully reduced the number and exposure to joint ventures to add clarity and simplicity to our program. We have reduced the number of joint ventures from the peak in 2006 of 270 to 62 currently, and that’s down from 72 last quarter. Many of these remaining ventures are good ventures that have already been reworked and have solid assets that are positioned for the future. We expect to reduce this number again by approximately half as we go through 2010. Additionally, we’ve continued to reduce the maximum recourse debt to the company to $288 million, down from $380 million last quarter.  On the opportunity side, we’ve been preparing for some time to do what we have done in past real estate cycles over and over again, and that is make the cycle our ally, not our adversary. We are clearly beginning to see opportunities take shape, and as noted earlier, divisions that are profitable are already beginning to purchase new land opportunities on a very conservative basis, and Rick will discuss this in greater detail in just a couple of minutes. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we’ve continued to mature our distressed asset go forward strategy under the banner of [Rialto]. As I noted in prior quarters, we’ve been preparing to be a significant participant in the distressed opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles, the team is formed, and we’ve begun the process of actively looking for unique distressed investments.  At the end of the day there will be a lot of mixed reviews of our fourth quarter numbers as many of you go through the elements of how we closed out 2009. Internally, however, there are no mixed reviews. We’ve positioned our company for fundamental profitability and we’re prepared to move forward.  Let me now turn over to John and Rick to give some additional color.
Jonathan M. Jaffe:  Thank you, Stuart, and good morning. As Stuart noted, we’ve had our division president meeting this week where each division presented the current state of their operation and their plan for 2010. I’m very pleased to report that the hard work and intense focus on improving operating margins that has taken place in the field over the past year is beginning to produce positive results. Division by division, we are taking our land position, building cost effective homes, delivering them to today’s homebuyer as the home is completed and producing a positive operating margin. Our divisions have effectively managed the sales of homes as they move along their construction assembly line, resulting in our ending the quarter with less than one completed inventory home per wholly owned community. All of our divisions are achieving this success with new product offerings, reduced construction costs and right-sized SG&A. A perfect example of this is our successful rollout of our regional product strategy. In each of our regions we now have in place a series of value engineered plans designed for use in multiple markets within that region. This has allowed us to further reduce construction costs. For example, in Phoenix, Tucson and Las Vegas we now have only 15 plans. These floor plans have replaced 40 plans and have resulted in reduced construction costs, which are down by 12% on an apples-to-apples basis. These plans have simplified architecture yet offer design, lifestyle and energy saving features that is attracting new home buyers.  This strategy has now only produced well received and cost efficient plans, but the consistent use of these plans allowed us to reduce overhead in our manufacturing process. Stuart has described our regional operating centers on prior calls, where we have consolidated our purchasing and other administrative processes. In the west, where we support operations in Phoenix, Tucson and Las Vegas, we have reduced the cost of this operating center from over $6 million last year to $3.5 million this year. This focused management of our homebuilding machine is allowing us to start new homes in our existing communities. With positive operating margins, we will be able to increase the pace of these starts as each market continues to stabilize. With low inventory and the delivery of positive operating margins, we’re well positioned to grow our business as we move through 2010. I’ll now turn it over to Rick Beckwitt, who will describe our activity in land acquisition that will fuel that growth.
Richard Beckwitt:  Thanks, John. Our primary focus on the land side has been to work through our existing asset base to generate cash. In many cases, this has required us to redesign product or work with the towns and municipalities to change what we can build in our communities. The towns have been very amenable to lowering specs, reducing square footage sizes and even increasing density on a property because they desperately need the income associated with new construction. In conjunction with this balance sheet first approach, we have been extremely active on the new acquisition side. The distress in the market has presented numerous opportunities for us to acquire new properties that can add to profitability in 2010 and 2011. We have been doing this under the radar screen for some time now. Since August, we’ve put under contract approximately 5,000 home sites in about 50 communities. The vast majority of these new deals are finished home sites where we can buy the land and start building the home immediately. Most of these deals have been structured as rolling options where we have a small or even no deposit and where we can buy the land when we need it. In many of these deals, a piece of the purchase price for the land is actually paid when we close the home with our buyer.  As you can imagine, the financial returns from these low risk, properly priced deals are extremely attractive due to the short period of time between when we buy the land and when we deliver the home. Let me give you some examples of a few recent deals. Our Dallas division optioned 50 home sites in McKinney, Texas. We put down $100 deposit and we can buy these home sites any time we want prior to December, 2012. Our purchase price for these home sites was a fraction of where they were selling at the peak of the market. With truly conservative underwriting, this deal will generate an IRR north of 50% and gross margins in the mid-20% range.  Our Charlotte division optioned 32 home sites recently in a truly A location in Mecklenburg County. We put up a $5,000 deposit. The deal has a modest take of about five home sites every 90 days. We had product ready to go and are able to deliver homes within three months of the initial close. The IRR on this deal exceeds 100% and the gross margins on this deal are in the high 20% range. Now not all of our deals will generate these type of returns, but all of the underwriting we’re doing today pencils out with gross margins in the 20% range and pretax margins of approximately 10%.  In addition to option contracts, we’ve been selectively using our cash to buy distressed opportunities. These purchases range from land banks, cash strapped developers and builders, foreclosure sales, short sales and even backing into assets by purchasing CDD obligations. While the IRRs generated from these purchases may not be as high as from our option contracts, the pretax profit and margins are significant. Here are a few examples of some recent purchases. Our Northern California division recently purchased 33 home sites through a foreclosure from three banks. These home sites were located in an A-plus community in the Bay area. In a normalized market, the ratio of the finished home site price to the sales price is about a 40% to 45% ratio. We acquired them in bulk at about a 20% ratio. We closed this deal in December and we will deliver homes in June. The gross margin on this deal is in the 30% range, with pretax margins in the high teens. Our Fresno division recently purchased two deals from a builder exiting the market. The first deal was 21 home sites in a move up location in the Fresno market. The second deal was 52 home sites in an entry level location in Fresno. While one was move up, one was entry, they were both A locations in their price segment. In each deal we have product ready to go and we will be delivering home sites within three months of closing the transaction. Both of these deals generate gross margins approaching 30% and pretax margins in the high teens. A more funky deal is one we recently completed in south Florida. In this deal we purchased approximately 500 home sites from an investor group that desperately needed cash. In the transaction we also assumed some B bond debt and simultaneously purchased some CDD debt at a big discount. Our finished home site price resulting from this three part transaction is extremely competitive. In addition, our gross margins and pretax margins are excellent.  I hope this gives you a peek at some of the things we’ve been up to. We’ve tried to stay away from the bank-to-broker-to-bid deals because the pricing in those things are a little stretchy. Most of our opportunities have been generated by good solid work from our seasoned land associates. They have excellent relationships and are truly tied in to their local markets. I’d like to turn it over to Bruce now who will review our financial results.
Bruce E. Gross:  Thanks, Rick, and good morning. Starting with the operating results for the quarter, you will note that this is our first quarterly earnings that we’ve reported since the first quarter of 2007.  We reported earnings of $0.19 per share as you can see in the press release which includes $1.34 earnings per share from the reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance primarily due to the net operating loss carry back and that’s offset by a $0.58 per share charge related to valuation adjustments and other write-offs, and a $0.31 per share charge related to valuation adjustments to land that the company has either sold or intends to sell to third parties. Now there are a lot of numbers in that opening [audio impairment] and I’d like to summarize the quarter results as follows. We did note sequential operating improvement in our pre-impairment operating margin, which improved from a negative 30 basis points in our third quarter to a positive 160 basis points in the fourth quarter. There was clear improvement as you’ve heard so far on the gross margin line, while we did have some non-recurring charges in our selling, general and administrative costs which will reduce our overhead prospectively and help us return to profitability. As noted in our impairment number, we disposed of several longer term assets which will result in a tax refund in early 2010 and additionally in the fourth quarter we purchased new, well positioned communities that Rick went through that will lead to activity in 2010 with superior gross margins. So let me break that down a little further. In the press release we described our revenues going down 30% which was driven by a 22% decrease in home deliveries, excluding joint ventures, and a 9% decrease in the average sales price to $238,000. The average sales price by region changed as follows. The East was $225,000 which was down 8%; the Central was $205,000 up 2%; the West was $313,000, down 12%; Houston was [inaudible], that was up 1%; and the other category was $257,000 which was down 8%. Our pre-impairment gross margin which improved to 17.8% from 15.6% in the third quarter was driven by a couple of factors.  The first one as Stuart mentioned was the reduction in sales incentives of over $15,000 per home. The lower sales incentives resulted in an improved selling environment; our repositioned product strategy as well as fewer completed unsold homes, which in prior quarters commanded larger incentives since we were focused on converting that inventory to cash. Second, as John mentioned, was the continued operating focus on reducing our construction costs per square foot which are down 25% approximately from the peak. There’s one other I’d like to discuss that impacted gross margin and that related to Chinese drywall. With our proactive approach to dealing with Chinese drywall, we found an approximately 100 additional homes requiring remediation during the quarter. The rate at which we’re discovering additional homes with Chinese drywall has been slowing and we expect to be completed with our homes identified with Chinese drywall by the end of the second quarter. We are actively pursuing recovery from manufacturers, installers and various insurance companies and we’ve accrued an additional charge during the quarter of $22 million for additional homes identified, homes yet to be identified and the possibility that we may not receive full recovery for these costs.  Although this charge had a negative impact on our gross margin, we did have some offsetting positive impacts to gross margin, primarily related to obligations no longer required on property disposed of during the year. Turning to impairments, in the fourth quarter we recorded $255 million of valuation adjustments and write-offs. The categories for the fourth quarter were as follows; homebuilding was $56 million; land sold or under contract was $89 million, of which $72 million closed during the quarter; write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs were $64 million and joint ventures were $38 million.  Of the $255 million of impairments during the quarter, $133 million qualified to be carried back under the extended NOL carry back provision enacted in our fourth quarter since we liquidated our position in those assets. As such, they are a component of the $320 million refund we expect to receive in early 2010. As a result of this $320 million refund, we also reported a corresponding reversal of our deferred tax asset reserve totaling $320 million.  We have continued to focus aggressively on reducing SG&A costs which declined $32 million year-over-year. Now although the percentage as a percent of revenue from home sales was 16.2% and increased year-over-year, if you exclude the non-recurring lease termination costs and legal costs during the quarter, which totaled approximately $15 million, our SG&A improved sequentially by about 150 basis points. New orders improved 3% year-over-year. Our backlog dollar value improved 5% year-over-year and these are the first year-over-year increases that we’ve seen for some time. The cancellation rate declined to 20% for the quarter versus 32% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our backlog conversion ratio was 141% during the quarter. Our financial services segment earned a $7.8 million profit during the quarter, despite lower revenues. This compared with a loss of $5.4 million in the prior year and both our mortgage and title operations have improved their processes through the downturn and are operating more efficiently and profitable. Mortgage generated a $7.9 million pretax profit versus $6.3 million in the prior year and our title company turned profitable to $2.3 million versus the prior year loss of $7.7 million. Additionally, we have strategically been selling our remaining cable systems over the last several years and this quarter we recorded a charge of $2 million on the sale of a cable system.  As we look forward to 2010, our first quarter is expected to be a low volume quarter, similar to the trend that we noted in 2009, and therefore it’s expected to generate a loss. However, we are still positioned to return to profitability in 2010.  Turning to the balance sheet, as Stuart highlighted our strong position, we continue to focus on cash flow while also targeting attractive investments for this recovery market. We continue to carefully manage our inventory as we reduce totally owned, completed, unsold homes from 1,140 to 480. We sold approximately 2,000 home sites in positions that were previously mothballed while closing on approximately a new 3,500 home sites, totaling approximately $148 million in the well located, ready-to-go communities that Rick talked about. Inventory declined from $3.8 billion in the prior year to $3.5 billion in the current quarter and this excludes consolidated inventory not owned. There were approximately 104,000 home sites owned and controlled at quarter end.  We talked about the reduction in our joint ventures; of the 62 that are remaining we have only 22 that have recourse debt, 17 with non-recourse debt and 23 with no debt. We reduced our maximum recourse indebtedness as Stuart mentioned to $288 million. These joint ventures with recourse indebtedness remaining are supported by approximately $1.3 billion of assets. Additionally, we reduced our non-recourse joint venture debt by $548 million. We started this year with $3.5 billion of non-recourse debt with our unconsolidated joint ventures and we ended the year with $1.3 billion of non-recourse debt. We continued to be successful in extending joint venture loans upon maturity. For the year now we have successfully modified and extended 38 of those joint venture loans.  We ended the quarter with substantial equity of $2.4 billion, approximately 184.9 million shares outstanding. Our book value per share was $13.13 per share. If you reversed or excluded the deferred tax asset reserve, which we expect to be reversed in the future, the book value per share would be $16.72. So with that we feel good with our financial position and our position to rebuild to profitability in 2010, so with that I’d like to turn it back to the operator to open for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Carl Reichardt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC.
Carl Reichardt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Two questions, first for Rick, you used the term “stretchy” in describing valuations from bank-to-broker-to-bid deals and I’d like you to expand on that a little bit. Tell me if you’re seeing an increase in the volume of transactions that you’re looking at in that regard. What is happening to those transactions? Are they sitting out there or are other people buying them? And what does “stretchy” mean in numeric terms?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, I think by “stretchy” I mean those transactions have seemed to be penciling out at more pricey terms. They’re not coming out all at the same time. They’re coming out onesy, twosy so you’ve got a lot of people looking at them and the people that are really driving the pricing up are really the investors because the builders really have the sense as to where to pencil out. Not a lot of them are trading. They sit there for a while. Most of those things are finished home site opportunities and what we’ve focused on as opposed to bidding on the deals that may come out from the banks is really trying to get into the banks and working the relationships that we’ve established over the years.  And the thing that they are most focused on is the reliability of the close and whether the deal is going to trade. And so that’s what’s made us successful during this process.
Carl Reichardt - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  And then the second question I guess for Bruce, on backlog conversion rate which was again relatively high, I know you’re going to have an additional number of transactions as Rick described them coming in. That way you’ll be able to do quick turn on finished spots. I’m still having a hard time sort of figuring out what backlog conversion kind of can be. Can you give me a sense in 2010 if you’re expecting kind of a similar traditional, seasonal pattern and similar numbers to ’09? Or how should we think about that?
Bruce E. Gross : Well, I would look at the first quarter the same way as we looked at 2009 actuals as far as backlog conversion ratio, which was more in the 130% range. And then as you continue through the year, I think you need to keep in mind that 2009 had a significant number of completed unsold homes the first part of the year and that led to a very high backlog conversion ratio, up to the tune of 190%. So that was more of an anomaly and the backlog conversion ratio for the rest of this year will depend on the market conditions and how many communities we bring on, but it should be averaging more in the mid-100% range as opposed to the extremes that we noted last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: I guess my question is you mentioned you bought 5,000 home sites and realizing their very quick turn, what is your expectation in 2010 in terms of the closings that those will contribute with these higher margins relative to the 2009 results?
Richard Beckwitt : Well, Ivy, just to be clear, we didn’t acquire all 5,000. A lot of those are rolling option deals and we’ll take them as we need them over the next year or two. And given the lead time associated with the construction process, most of our build cycle is on the shorter side. We can get something built in about 45 days today because we’ve got a really efficient team, but some of our products take, you know, three to four months. So you can assume that on the option deals we’ve structured them to really take them down as we sell them and a lot of that’s going to be driven by the market, so closing these deals should sequentially absorb more on the tail end of 2010 and be a pretty good contributor into 2011.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates:  My follow up question really relates to you know concerns we’ve had about FHA tightening, recognizing that, you know, public policy today, who knows if it will happen or not. It’s anybody’s call. At least they’re saying they’re going to tighten. So what is your exposure to FHA if you look at your 2009 book?
Stuart Miller : Our exposure’s probably in the 60% range and there’s no question that there’s still a lot of moving parts out there. You know, FHA requiring additional down and tightening up lending standards. These are all questions that are out there. I think the single most important factor, though, right now is the absorption of the foreclosure inventory out there that is I think setting the stage for somewhat of a return to more normal times. And kind of as I highlighted, I think that there’s going to be some tightening of some of the lending standards, but I think that that’s going to be and I’m hoping that that’s going to be in the face of a somewhat depleting relevant inventory.  Just to highlight again, you know, there are a lot of foreclosures out there, but the ones that are in the relevant locations are absorbing in an orderly course and I think that’ll help form the field for tightened lending standards, not overly impacting what can be absorbed in the marketplace.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Goldberg – UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS:  The first question, Bruce, I wanted to follow up on something you said in the comments about the margin improvement and the percentages specs and how the decline in the percentages specs contributes to the margin improvement. And I’m wondering if you’d give us an idea, I guess first of all, what percent of the improvement in margin or some kind of estimate how much you think was responsible because of specs? And also do you expect specs as a percentage of overall deliveries, do you think that’s going to kind of even out at current levels as to where we are today?
Bruce E. Gross: Well, your first question with respect to how much of the margin improvement related to the reduction in completed unsold homes, I can’t give you an exact number, David, because you’re dealing with a lot of communities, a lot of moving targets across the country, but you know I think a few things to think about there. One, at the beginning of last year we not only had a very large number of completed unsold, but our main focus as a company being balance sheet first with questionable capital markets and the overall economy, what was going to happen, we were very focused on converting inventory to cash. We now have a very stable balance sheet and as John mentioned we’re down to about one completed home, so we’re back to a little bit more normal times and we expect that those incentives per home continue to decline for 2010. But I can’t give you the exact percentage of the improvement in margin that that related to. And then your second question again, David?
David Goldberg – UBS:  It was kind of 1B, right? I think the question was about in terms of the incentives how you balance the incentives on sales, looking at the sales base and the potential leverage you can drive is do you cut incentives to get some more leverage out of the SG&A line? Or do you kind of leave incentives where they are and try to drive some more sales? I think that makes sense.
Jonathan M. Jaffe:  David, this is John. It’s very market specific but clearly where we’ve been able to sell as we move through the construction process and not have specs, we’ve been able to reduce our incentives. In many of the markets that have seen more stabilization we’ve seen more forward sales, pre-sales and that has allowed us to effectively reduce incentives. And so as we move through the markets and as they bounce up and down, and I think it’ll affect our ability to continue to reduce those incentives, but as an overall trend based on what we’re seeing expect us to control our inventory as our divisions move through the process and be able to continue to reduce incentives.
Stuart Miller: Yes, let me just add to that, David. We’ve got some valuable assets that we’re putting on the books right now, whether it’s some of the assets that have been written down or whether it’s some new assets that we’re purchasing at a good price. It’s an art, not a science. We’re going to maximize profitability and maximize the value that we can receive. So there’s a balance in how much of incentives we leave out there in order to achieve volume, but we want to sell homes so that we’re maximizing the profitability that we generate from every asset that we’ve got right now.
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, Stuart, I guess I’d add to that by saying all of our divisions know exactly what their breakeven performance is, how many homes they need to close every month in order to be profitable. And we’re holding them accountable for that profitability. In conjunction with that, each of the divisions is really focused on increasing sales prices and moving the appraisers up in value. And we get more in the long term by increasing the sales price than by having an incremental closing in the quarter to push the volume. That’s going to help us in the long term.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan: First question is on the you know gross margins and SG&A. You had the nice bump up and we’ve kind of reviewed and hashed out some of the drivers. Without giving guidance, you know, for the upcoming year, you know, there is a pretty decent difference between this quarter and what you were posting in the first three quarters of the year, so how are we to think about 2010? You know, certainly you’ve talked about [inaudible] goal of profitability, but is that driven off of a higher gross margin than the average of 2009 and/or a lower SG&A level?
Stuart Miller: Well, Mike, as I said, it’s really a balance and, you know, my opening remarks I hope I made clear that we’re really looking at a rocky bottom stabilization. And I think that anything along the lines of visibility has got to be suspect. And I want to make sure that I’m clear on that. You know as I look ahead, and as we looked ahead division by division over the past couple of days, you know, margin can move around a little bit and I don’t want to give you some guidance that I can’t live up to. In today’s market looking ahead too much, it’s complicated. But I think we’re certainly seeing margins at a higher level than we’ve seen in 2008, 2009 and exactly where they’re going to fall is going to be in large part defined by how the market gyrates around a little bit. But you know as I said in my opening remarks what we’re starting to see in terms of margin stabilization feels a lot more right now like a trend and what the actual number is we’re going to have to wait and see what the market gives us.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan:  Just a follow up question, separate topic, on regional strengths, you know, given the higher level of activity in terms of land acquisition, I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts in terms of, you know, across your national portfolio of markets where you’re doing more deals, where you’re a little more optimistic on the margin, one market relative to another. And also if you can overlay onto that, you know, if there are some markets that have higher levels of FHA exposure relative to others.
Stuart Miller: You know, in terms of geographies, the way I’d say it is most geographies have something positive to give. And the most impaired geographies, the land prices and the home prices have fallen the farthest. In the least impaired geographies, they’ve fallen less. But with stabilization all of those geographies have land opportunities, assets, value that can generate a profitable home sale and so as we’ve seen stabilization almost across the board, there are still a few communities or areas that are falling, but those are fewer. In almost all of our geographies we’re finding opportunity to stabilize our business and start growing profitability. In terms of FHA based production, most of the geographies, the sweet spot of the market is clearly in the affordable range. That’s where financing is available and most available. As you get to the higher price points, financing becomes much more complicated. So pretty much across the board we’ve adjusted our product carefully to move into that broader range of affordable housing. And so we clearly have a lot more FHA exposure pretty much across the board.
Michael Rehaut - J.P. Morgan:  The $22 million of charges related to drywall, is that in SG&A? And I know you said there was offsetting positives as well. Does that fully offset the $22 and are they in different components of the income statement?
Bruce E. Gross: They are both in gross margin and the offsetting credits to the $22 million, [inaudible] a significant portion of that $22 million, not all of it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital.
Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital: I wanted to follow up a little bit on the SG&A side. Stuart, in your opening comments you talked about potentially being positioned to start adding back some jobs from earlier losses in the cycle, so I wanted to get an idea of your thoughts there. I know expectations will change throughout the year, but how are you thinking about headcount going into 2010? And given your current expectations, should we expect that SG&A might actually grow next year on a dollar basis or should we still expect it to see a little pressure?
Stuart Miller: Well, maybe this won’t sound right, but I’m kind of hoping that SG&A grows on a dollar basis next year. What we’ve talked a lot about is the fact that, you know, the business is kind of stabilizing and therefore we’re starting to look at adding communities to the divisions that are ready to begin moving forward. And with the addition of new communities comes the addition of new construction people and sales associates that we need to build and sell in those communities for our fundamental operation. So we think that there are going to be some opportunities to add jobs. And frankly it’s a lot of what we’re seeing and hearing from our division presidents as [inaudible] the broader economy, as we see stabilization jobs ought to come back and that’s breeding some optimism overall. I think we’re part of the broader economy. Additionally, and maybe less visible is as our program in Rialto starts to reveal itself, we start to see that in the distressed work out world there’s some job creation in that arena as well and we think that through our Rialto affiliation program, we’re going to see some job creation there as well.
Richard Beckwitt: But to be clear, we have the fixed infrastructure in place to probably deliver another 4,000 to 5,000 homes today. And if you look at it from a field standpoint, that’s all we need to hire. The only other variable cost in there will be the commissions associated with the sales of the home and some incremental signage within the communities. So from a leverage standpoint, we are really positioned to push profits down as we bring on our new associates and bring the new communities on.
Stuart Miller: And I’ll just add to that I think we’re going to push the cost down as Rick was saying, but there is a lag on some of the SG&A costs. So another thing to keep in mind is we’ve incurred a lot of costs this year as we’ve worked ourselves out of a number of leases and those costs will not be recurring as we go into next year. So we’ve taken three or four years to right size the company but it’s been a lag to the reduction in the size of the company. So there will be a reduction in costs relating to infrastructure.
Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital:  And I just wanted to follow up on your comments around profitability and make sure that we all sort of have the bar in the same place. Bruce, when you talk about being positioned for profitability in 2010, I want to make sure that I understand exactly what you mean there. Is that hitting it in a particular quarter, is that for the full year, is that excluding or including impairments? You know by this time next year what would you have considered meeting that goal?
Bruce E. Gross: We’re looking for 2010 in total to be profitable. I did indicate that we expect a loss in the first quarter, so those are the two components that I’ve commented on for 2010 and relative to impairments, you know, we’re close to $5 billion of impairments over the last almost four years and we think we’re really just about done with the impairments unless the market was to turn south from here.
Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital:  So that would be a positive EPS number in 2010?
Bruce E. Gross: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs:  My question is around the incentives in your backlog. Can you talk about where those are relative to the 36,000 that you guys printed this quarter? In addition to that, you said that each division knows where the breakeven is. Can you talk about the breakeven absorption rates for corporate?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, let’s start with the sales incentives in our backlog. We do believe that as we go into 2010 there’ll be some continued reduction in the sales incentives per home. So you know let’s just make that statement. The backlog is an indicator, so there is some additional improvement coming. As far as the breakeven, we really look at that on a division by division basis because at the corporate level you have some additional items, financial services and interest expense that’s not in the division sale. It’s really a more appropriate number from a division by division basis.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs:  On your last call you talked about each one of your 29 divisions being profitable by year end or at least the majority of them. How close are you to that goal? And what else is needed to get there? It seems like gross margin is clearly moving in the right direction. How much more do you need to take out of SG&A to get there?
Stuart Miller: I think in most instances we’re pretty much there. I think that we’ve had some extraordinary costs this quarter, we’ve taken some additional impairments, we’ve done a lot of things to position the company, but on a division by division basis our divisions for the most part are reporting positive operating programs. I think we’re pretty much there.
Richard Beckwitt: And I think that your focus is really on the wrong component. Our divisions are running about as lean as you can run a company right now and where the upside is going to come over the next [inaudible], having incremental price appreciation, incremental closings, just volume, it’s really top side growth. We have pulled about as much cost out of the G&A structure as you can pull out of a company.
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs:  Could I get your spec count at the end of November as well as your community count?
Richard Beckwitt: So the completed unsold, I think I gave that number was 480 at the end of the fourth quarter and the community count was just under 400 for the fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank:  I wanted to return to the land purchases, the 5,000 lots that Rick mentioned you’ve purchased since August. Now it sounds like opportunism is the best way to characterize those purchases and that certainly makes a lot of sense and you’re obviously being very conservative in terms of buying [inaudible] and doing a lot of option takedowns as well. Now looking ahead, though, that strategy, you know the kind of opportunism combined with a conservative kind of underwriting outlook, is going to be difficult as you get back to growth because it’ll be difficult, you know, to return to the volume levels you were in prior years, just focusing on those opportunities. Obviously there’s going to be a lot more competition as well, so unless you’re planning on shrinking the size of Lennar, you know, relative to where it was historically, at some stage you would need to wade into riskier propositions, in other words larger or less developed. So, Stuart, I wanted to get a sense from you as to when and if that transition would happen? And where we would see that show up? Would that be primarily in Rialto or would it also be for Lennar as well?
Richard Beckwitt: Let me take a stab at it and then I’ll throw it over to Stuart. I think that you’re wrong with regard to whether some of the deal flow’s going to not continue. There’s a tremendous amount of property that’s still held by the banks that they just haven’t decided yet to liquefy. Some of them are making determinations as whether they’re going to survive or not. That combined with other investors that own property that are working their way through the foreclosure process, the deal flow’s going to continue into 2010, 2011 and 2012. I guess in conjunction with that, as the market normalizes and improves if I follow your assumption there, sales prices are going to go up which is also going to make some of the transactions pencil out at higher prices. So in an improving market it’s going to raise the ship all the way across the board. And we’re going to continue to generate deal flow, option contract, purchase properties and do things opportunistically.
Stuart Miller: Yes, you know, I think from our view right now, we’re starting at a base of where we are today in terms of the number of deliveries, size of the company. You know looking historically at what we delivered some years ago is not the basis on which we’re running the company today. Right now we have operating divisions that are sized and positioned to be able to operate where they are, and they will grow in an orderly, methodical way, primarily focused on generating profitability. And I do think that, you know, number one, there are an awful lot of opportunities out there that are going to be harvested over the next years. Number two, I think that there are far fewer players in the marketplace to compete for those opportunities. It doesn’t mean that some of them won’t come back.  And number three, the Rialto program that we have in place is a significant opportunity for us. It is an opportunity to participate and invest in bulk opportunities, not the types of things that our divisions are particularly positioned to go out and look at, but larger opportunities with mixed assets. It’s something that we’ve done productively in the past and I think that we’ll see a lot of opportunities through Rialto that will A, be absorbed into Rialto and B, will lead to opportunities for each of our divisions.  So I think if there’s visibility to anything, there’s visibility to a lot of opportunity on the ground and out there that has to be absorbed over the next years.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank:  I’ve always appreciated you folks fairly straightforward assessment of conditions out there so obviously listen keenly when you describe stabilization, improving conditions. Now it’s always going to be tough in terms of what your reference points are. You know, your data reference points when we’re in a choppy bottom I think as you very well characterized it. I was just wondering though when you’re taking a slightly more optimistic stance, you know, obviously the national data and anecdotally as well, there was definitely some weakening after the tax credit expired. So I was just wondering what’s your reference points then for this more optimistic stance. I mean are you looking to now and to January? Are you kind of looking ahead to the spring selling season or was the apparent weakness not really affecting Lennar as much?
Stuart Miller: No, that apparent weakness was very real and I think felt by everybody. And you know, first of all let me say as a reference point, it’s very much listening to the people who are in the field, in different geographies, giving feedback and giving an assessment of their marketplace. And especially at this time of year, the holiday season is a particularly slow time for housing and very hard to get a read. The information that I’m giving to you all today has more to do with the tangible sense that our people in the fields are getting from talking to customers, seeing whose coming in the door as traffic, not necessarily pulling the trigger quite yet but what the general sentiment is out there and the appetite is for buying homes.  The $8,000 tax credit seemed like it was going to go away and then as I said thankfully Congress extended it. The significance of that tax credit is its import in helping to absorb the inventory of foreclosures that are out there while also providing some impetus for buyers to buy new homes as well. But the big inventory factor that we have in front of us today still remains the foreclosure issue. It’s not new homes on the ground. Its existing homes that are going through a foreclosure process, an REO process and finding their way on to the marketplace. And what we’re finding is that extension of the $8,000 credit is really a boon to absorbing that inventory and getting us back to a normal playing field where then without the training wheels of government stimulus we can start to rebuild, you know, the backbone of housing as it was in years past. So, you know, my perspective right now is that with unemployment no longer rising at the rate that it was, with a little bit more confidence in the step of the buyer, with the absorption of some of the foreclosure in relevant areas kind of accelerating, I think that as we go through the beginning of this year and into the selling season we’re likely to see some stability. And I think that even as we see the dissipation of the $8,000 credit at the end of March that you know hopefully we’re going to see the foundation form of a more stabilized environment for housing going forward. You know, we’ll have to wait and see. There’s nothing certain about what I’m saying, but these are the data points and senses that I’m getting from people on the ground, our people on the ground in diverse geographies.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse.
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse:  Do you think the land transactions that you see are numerous enough that you could end, you’re confident in the market, that you could end up with an increase in community count year-over-year in 2010?
Richard Beckwitt: Yes, I think that we will have a rise in community count in 2010. You know just from an overall standpoint, we’ve got about 25 divisions right now and it would not be unrealistic for each division to put on another two communities in the market.
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse:  You talked about the benefit of pushing on price as opposed to volume and how that has a greater long term [inaudible]. As we look at other builders and competitors where they’ve talked about increasing their spec home construction with the tax credit extension here, do you worry about that at all? Do you think that you basically have to follow suit and go for a little bit more volume if they’re going to be the same this spring?
Stuart Miller: No, I think that everybody’s got a slightly different strategy and as we’ve seen many times before, there isn’t one strategy that’s the right answer. We have our answer. I think that we’re going to stay very focused on profitability on a division-division basis and making sure that we’re maximizing the profit out of the valuable acquisitions that we’ve put in place. I think that we will have, you know, the benefit of perhaps an increase in community count. I think that the biggest factor though, Dan, is the foreclosure landscape and I think that the single most important thing that we can look for and hope for is that concurrent with the absorption of some of the inventory that’s out there, perhaps the government lands on some strategies to keep people in their homes. I know that they’re working hard at that. And to the extent that we find that there’s some strategy to keep people, to help with either payment abatement or maybe some principal reduction or something, that will be the most meaningful affect on the supply landscape. And whether one builder or another adds a little bit of standing inventory or not is not the biggest part of the market right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Wilson - JMP Securities.
James Wilson - JMP Securities: Rick, could you just describe on the, or whoever wants to take it on the new deals and what you’re looking at, kind of how you look at how returns or margins compare to you know what you’ve just reported? Any color you can give there?
Richard Beckwitt: Well, on the new transactions as I said we’re really looking to have gross margins in excess of 20%. We’d like fully loaded G&A and pretax margins in the 10% range. We didn’t report a 10% pretax profit the last quarter but that’s what we’re looking for on new underwriting. And to the extent that we put more cash out there, the returns need to be greater. John?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: I think as you look at it, you build a judgment based on our gross margins, which we expect will have some slight improvement as we move forward, these new deals as we layer them on top of our existing deals should help that gross margin grow. As we mentioned already we’ve got a very right size adjusted company now, division by division, so those higher gross margins will drive an improved bottom line margin.
James Wilson - JMP Securities:  Bruce, I was looking at the JV reduction and how much was there a chunk of that or a significant chunk that moved on balance sheet? And I guess maybe tied into that is the land you have sold or for sale that you’re reserved against, did much of that come from the JV category or was that all already on balance sheet?
Bruce E. Gross: Well, the first question there, there was one joint venture in particular that moved on the balance sheet and was consolidated this quarter. But as far as the land sales, if you’re referring to the land sales that we talked through, those land sales were all to third parties that I mentioned, which was included in the impairment numbers. 
Stuart Miller : With that said, the joint venture discussion is really becoming pretty small relative to the company these days. And we’re really enthusiastic about that because it’s created an awful lot of noise. The lion’s share of the ventures that we have out there right now are going to move through to completion in the normal course. Many of them are good, solid, well run, good working joint ventures that are going to generate cash flow, pay off their debt and return capital or actually provide profit to the company. So I think that we’ve made some meaningful progress, sometimes taking some assets on book, sometimes you know taking some impairment, but I think that we’ve put a lot of that or all of that behind us at this point. And the joint venture stress is for the most part out of the system.
Operator: Your next question comes from James McCanless - FTN Equity Capital Markets.
James McCanless - FTN Equity Capital Markets: First question on the tax strategy that you all employed for fiscal ’09, what does this imply for potential impairments and is there the potential for any more tax refunds in the future?
Bruce E. Gross: Jay, good morning. We did maximize what was available to us with what was enacted in the fourth quarter with the NOL carry back. So the $320 million that we talked about, that was the maximum available to us so we are not expecting additional refunds beyond that.
James McCanless - FTN Equity Capital Markets:  And any implications for impairments we should read from it?
Bruce E. Gross: Any implications for impairments? No, I think as I indicated in the impairments this quarter which were larger than some of the last several quarters, embedded in that we took approximately $133 million of additional impairments that qualified for that NOL carry back, so I think the additional impairments related to that have already occurred during the quarter.
Stuart Miller:  Well, I think you can read something into that and that is that basically by enacting the NOL carry back and by us getting involved and being able to maximize it, we’ve probably moved forward impairments that we might have taken or might have seen in the future and probably have drawn to a close or a minimum anything that we’ll see as we go forward. I think we’re back to a normalized business model today and I think that’s part of what has us enthusiastic about closing out 2009. I think that the NOL carry backs facilitated moving beyond the impaired environment that we’ve been in. We can start adding communities and frankly adding jobs, which I think was the import of exactly that legislation.
James McCanless - FTN Equity Capital Markets:  I believe last quarter that you talked about buying land in Texas, California, Florida and just wanted to know are those the same geographies where you’re finding deals now or are there other geographies that are opening up for you?
Richard Beckwitt: We’ve been really focused nationally. I think that we’ve had participation in every market.
Operator: Your last question comes from Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: I just want to look into the fixed G&A structure that you guys have because it seems when you talk about normalized margins and it’s 20 plus on the gross margin, you know, directionally you’re more there and the real issue considering selling is variable is its moving your fixed G&A percentage down. And that percentage will actually be I think quite a bit more than your gross margin move up, so if you have enough staffing for 4,000 to 5,000 more closings on a base of 11,000, when do you expect to get that fixed G&A structure more in line? I mean are you looking for that much growth in 2010? I doubt it. Right? So how do you get that fixed G&A structure down relative to the revenue? Is it some pricing assumption? Because with five communities it seems hard to get that much volume through to absorb your fixed G&A.
Richard Beckwitt: When we talked about the 4,000 or 5,000 incremental closings that we could do through the machine that was not a suggestion that that’s what we’re going to do this year. I think that the built in infrastructure on a divisional basis, to handle incremental communities, where you only have to hire a builder and someone that’s going to manage the sales process at the local level. Because the division is scaled to handle more. And if you just aggregate that up across the country, we’ve got that kind of built in capacity because the infrastructure is there. As that volume starts to appear and we generate that, whether it’s this year or next year or 2013, the overall SG&A margin will go down and that fixed G&A will be covered by those incremental top side revenues. Does that answer your question?
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities:  It does. It’s the magnitude of the volume though because if you guys, you know, depending on how you back in or we would back into your fixed G&A, it seems like that could actually drop. I mean if your SG&A was 16% this quarter, the selling is variable at 5%, you know, you have a high fixed G&A structure which we could back into on a dollar basis and it seems like you’d need a lot of revenue growth to get profitability because the gross margin’s moved up quite a bit. I guess what is the units under construction is the other question?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Homes under construction as we ended the year were approximately 3,400.
Kenneth Zener - Macquarie Research Equities:  And the owned [mock] count? I know the 104 total, but the owned mock count?
Jonathan M. Jaffe: Right. So of the 104,000 let’s just put that in the high 70’s, 78,000.
Stuart Miller: And thank you everybody for joining us for our call. We look forward to moving into 2010 and reporting as we go forward. Thank you.
Operator: This will conclude today’s conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your speaker for today’s call, Mr. Stuart Miller, President, and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Thank you and good morning everyone. I would like to thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2009 update. I’m joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer, Diane Bessette, our Vice President, and Treasurer, David Controller our Controller, and of course you’ve heard from Scott Shipley. I’m going to begin with some opening remarks about the current housing market in general and then comment on our homebuilding, and finally focus on the progress we’ve made on managing our balance sheet and joint ventures.  And after my remarks Bruce will provide additional detail on our numbers and then we’ll open the phone to questions and as usual, I’d like to request that during our question-and-answer period, everyone please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. Now as you can see from our press release this morning, we continue to make meaningful progress in preparing our company for a stabilized and ultimately recovering housing market. We’re gaining confidence that we’re getting much closer to the end of this housing-led downturn and while there is still little visibility as to sales pace and pricing power looking ahead, the uncertainty as to the size of the declines is diminishing.  In the third quarter we started to see some real signs that the housing market is in fact starting to stabilize. There is no question that the rate of descent in both sales and pricing has begun to decline and in some markets we’ve actually seen stabilization.  There has been a discernable increase in traffic reported in many of our communities as purchases have begun to consider the home purchase as attractive again. A combination of low prices, lower interest rates, and government incentives have worked to peak the interest of primary buyers and dispel the taboo about home purchases that has deterred so many from the market.  Additionally with home affordability at record highs and with low price points offered in the market, there are more buyers interested in making a purchase. The sense that now is the time to buy is starting to gain momentum as potential qualified purchasers are getting confirmation from news reports and the overall stock market that prices are at or near lows.  In our third quarter we saw our sales volume decline at the lowest percentage rate since November of 2006. We’ve also seen in most of our divisions, a stabilization, or slight decline in the use of incentives which means in effect, that prices are stabilizing in many of our communities.  Our incentives per home fell in the third quarter by some $11,000 per home though that’s in part due to lower specs and lower prices but perhaps more reflective of market conditions, incentives were reduced by a little over 2% of the sales price of homes.  While there continued to be significant headwinds that limit stabilization and recovery, both for the economy in general and for housing as well, there are some significant positive influences that are beginning to shape a more positive future.  And perhaps the most important and least tangible of these factors is the general confidence of the consumer. Now by no means would I suggest that housing is out of the woods and recovered, to the contrary, many important headwinds remain.  Foreclosures continue to build and add to inventory at a significant rate. Mortgage rates have been fluctuating and while low today, are significant and sometimes uncertain factor for the future. Tax credit programs that have stimulated purchasers to make a purchase, are potentially ending or at least their futures are uncertain. And unemployment and gas prices are on the rise. Today’s economic environment and housing market is still tenuous and still suggests that there is downside risk. But with that said today’s environment is showing some real promise for stabilization and feels materially better then the absolute hopelessness that had existed for so long.  At Lennar we focused in three primary areas as we prepare our company for stabilization and ultimately recovery, and I’d like to briefly discuss these areas. The first is Lennar’s strategy. That Lennar strategy has been to streamline and prepare our core homebuilding operation for profitability and to position as a pure play homebuilder in a stabilizing and then recovering market.  Second we’ve remained focused on the asset management side of our business and have fortified our balance sheet to provide a solid foundation for our operations and to be positioned for growth as market conditions stabilize.  And third, we’ve focused on the opportunities that invariably present themselves in the wake of distress. We’ve continued to make significant progress in all of these areas. Let me start with our core homebuilding business, our homebuilding operating strategy continues to be well defined and focused at the local divisional level. We have 29 homebuilding divisions and each division is focused on refining its asset base, identifying its core communities and core product offerings, generating current operating cash flow, and operating at profitable levels.  Each is also focused on reducing the number of completed and unsold homes to enable a greater focus on profitability as we go forward. Overall, we’ve reduced the number of completed unsold homes from 625 in the second quarter to 515 at the end of the third quarter.  And just about every one of our divisions will be operating at cash flow positive and profitable by year-end and the divisions that are already operating at these profitable levels have begun looking at and purchasing distressed opportunities to grow and expand organically levering their efficient operating platform. The leverage of our division overhead that will return as new purchases are added to our existing operating platform will dramatically enhance profitability in each division. In every division we’ve reworked our product to appeal to today’s value oriented first time and move up purchaser.  We’ve also reduced the number of plan offerings and have value engineered those plans in order to create maximum efficiency and reduce construction costs. SG&A has been right sized in all of our divisions to today’s production levels and each can handle additional volume and with very little additional overhead. On the asset management front, we’ve continued to fortify our company by continuing to manage and restate our land asset while we carefully manage our inventory of completed homes and reduce the number and composition of our joint ventures.  We’ve continued to review all of our land assets on a quarterly basis and have restated asset values to match market conditions. Over the past years, we’ve significantly reduced our land asset, which now requires far less management time.  As market conditions stabilize we will finally see an end to this impairment cycle and will be left with assets that can and will produce improving margins when the rate of decline in market pricing subsides. While this is an ongoing process, in a still declining market, we’ve come quite a long way.  We’ve also reduced the number of joint ventures that we carry again. The number of joint ventures has fallen from 270 at the peak in 2006 to now 72 and that is down from 85 just last quarter. Many of these remaining ventures are good ventures that have already been reworked and have solid assets that are positioned for our future.  Additionally we’ve continued to reduce the maximum recourse debt to the company to $380 million from $422 million last quarter. Concurrent with this press release we’re also filing an 8-K with a power point presentation containing material additional disclosure on the joint ventures as we have. We hope that this disclosure will be helpful.  Our balance sheet remains strong at the end of the third quarter with a substantial cash position of over $1.3 billion. Additionally there is nothing borrowed on our revolver and we have a responsible homebuilding debt to total capital position net of cash that is now at 35.6%.  Our balance sheet and cash positions enable us to continue to seize opportunity where distress creates a unique value rather then walk away from opportunity. We anticipate that we will continue to use available cash to harvest value and opportunity from both our joint ventures and other sources as they arise.  On the opportunity side, we’ve been preparing for some time to do what we have done in past real estate cycles and that is make the cycle our ally not our adversary. We’re clearly beginning to see those opportunities take shape. As noted earlier divisions that are profitable are already beginning to purchase new land opportunities on a very conservative basis. We’ve seen new purchases along the eastern seaboard, in Florida, in Texas and in California. In all of these transactions we have purchased finished homesites that match our product in place and that will contribute immediately to our bottom line.  More importantly each of these purchases will produce a very high rate of return. On another opportunity front, the LandSource front, the very significant overhang that has existed on our company produced by our LandSource joint venture is now officially behind us.  In the third quarter the LandSource bankruptcy turned into an investment opportunity for the company while we eliminated approximately $1.4 billion of joint venture debt. We have reported that we invested $140 million to purchase a 15% interest in LandSource which has some of the best remaining land in California and is now capitalized at a very attractive valuation.  Additionally we purchased several assets out of the LandSource bankruptcy and we settled any claims against the company. This is an excellent deal for the company that will hold us in good stead for years to come.  Additionally the independently managed LandSource structure results in a significant reduction of SG&A for the company overall. Additionally in the third quarter we have continued to mature our distressed asset go-forward strategy under the banner of Rialto.  As I have noted in prior quarters, we’ve been preparing to be a significant participant in the distressed opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles. The team is formed and we’ve launched a program to raise independent capital in various forms to invest alongside our own capital investments.  While its still premature to be making these asset purchases we feel that the timing is getting closer. Our strategy is to segregate our homebuilding manufacturing program from the more capital intensive asset opportunity programs such as we did in the early 90’s as we built what ultimately became LNR Property Corporation.  And we’re confident that as the market corrects we will be able to create meaningful value for the company through this vehicle. Through our third quarter the housing market began to show signs that stabilization and recovery might well be on the horizon.  While negative factors continued to define the realities of the quarter we saw sales and traffic improve each month sequentially during the quarter, coincident with the general up tick in consumer confidence.  It is starting to feel like there are enough positive indicators out there that they are starting to define a real trend. At Lennar we’ve made a great deal of progress in the most difficult of market conditions. We have prepared our company for market conditions as they currently exist and we are positioned to be able to leverage our current platform by finding new opportunities in the wake of distress.  I remain quite optimistic about our business and the housing market in general. Interest rates are low, while the tax credits that have stimulated sales to date are coming to a natural end, government officials are squarely focused on housing issues and continue to focus on reducing the number of foreclosures by enabling homeowners to keep their homes.  Our government seems determined to use trial and error and trial again in order to fix the economy. And the general confidence of the consumer is returning to positive especially as it relates to purchasing a home.  In the context of these conditions and in typical Lennar tradition, we squarely have one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. Should the market take another step down, we are well positioned to pull back and should recovery actually begin, we are ready to participate. 
Bruce Gross : Thank you Stuart, and good morning. In the third quarter we continued to strengthen our balance sheet. Our liquidity position remained strong during the quarter with $1.34 billion of cash. During the quarter we continued our focus on cash flow while also targeting attractive investments for this recovering market.  We issued 8.1 million shares under our equity drawdown program announced last quarter, raising $99 million at an average price of $12.17 per share. The cumulative capital raise under this program now totals $225 million.  Our ample liquidity enabled us to reinvest $140 million in LandSource as Stuart mentioned. In addition to the communities purchased from LandSource we spent approximately $77 million on well-located finished home site purchases during the quarter.  Additionally we retired approximately $40 million of Lennar debt, while at the same time we continued our trend of significant progress towards reducing the number of unconsolidated joint ventures and related recourse indebtedness. Of the remaining 72 joint ventures that Stuart mentioned, only 29 have recourse debt, 18 have non-recourse debt, and 25 have no debt. Almost 50% of non-recourse JV indebtedness was reduced this quarter compared to the second quarter as $1.4 billion was eliminated as a result of the LandSource restructuring. This debt was non-recourse to LandSource and as a result there was no obligation to Lennar. The restructured LandSource entity, now called Newhall Land Development, is financially strong with more than $90 million of cash and no debt.  LandSource does not have any support obligations from Lennar going forward. Additionally we reduced our maximum recourse indebtedness as Stuart mentioned to $380 million. These joint ventures with recourse indebtedness are supported by approximately $1.6 [billion] of assets, which are evaluated for impairments each quarter, and $121 million of reimbursement agreements from partners if Lennar is required to pay under the guarantee. We have reduced our maximum recourse indebtedness now by approximately 80% since the end of 2006. We continued to be successful in extending joint venture loans upon maturity as we have mentioned over the past several quarters, and during this quarter we extended 18 of our remaining joint venture loans.  We are confident that in our fourth quarter we will continue the significant progress in further reducing both the number of unconsolidated joint ventures and the maximum recourse indebtedness to Lennar.  There were no outstanding borrowings on our revolver and once again we remain in full compliance with all of our covenants under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage remained low as our homebuilding debt to total capital net of cash was 35.6%.  And our inventory declined from $4.1 billion in the prior year to $3.6 billion in the current quarter excluding consolidated inventory not owned. There were approximately 4,600 homes under construction at August 31, 2009, which is an increase of approximately 14% sequentially.  There were 109,000 homesites owned and controlled at quarter end. We ended the quarter once again with substantial equity of $2.4 billion and approximately 183 million shares outstanding at quarter end which is a book value of $13.12 and that would be approximately $18.00 per share when adding back almost a $5.00 per share deferred tax asset reserve, which we do expect to be reversed after several quarters of profitability.  Turning to the operating results for the quarter, for the quarter we had a loss per share of $0.97 which includes $0.42 per share of charges related to valuation adjustments and other write-offs, and a $0.34 per share charge related to an non-cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  Revenues as you know from the press release declined 36% which was driven by a 28% decline in home deliveries, and a 28% decline in average sales price to $239,000. Regionally the average sales price breaks out follows. The east region was down 18% to $215,000.  The central was up 2% to $204,000. The west was down 12% to $329,000. Houston was up 1% to $203,000 and other was down 12% to $265,000. The average sales price is net of sales incentives, which as Stuart mentioned is down $11,000 sequentially, it was $53,000 in our second quarter and is $42,000 per home in the current quarter. That compares to $46,000 in the prior year’s quarter. The decline in sales incentives sequentially was noted in every one of our operating regions so this was a broad improvement in the sales incentive decline. Our gross margin was 15.6% before impairments, the pre-impairment gross margin declined from 18% in the prior year, however improved sequentially from 14% in our second quarter.  The sequential improvement in gross margin is primarily due to the reduction in sales incentives sequentially that I just mentioned. The lower sales incentives is a result of the improved selling environment, our repositioned product strategy, as well as fewer completed unsold homes which in prior quarters commanded larger incentives to convert that inventory to cash.  Our impairments for the quarter were $118 million, and that compared to $132 million in the prior year’s quarter. This was broken out as follows, $49 million for homebuilding, $1 million for land sold or under contract, write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs were $9 million, and joint ventures were $58 million.  The impairment process followed the same rigorous discipline we have followed each quarter throughout the downturn. We have continued to focus aggressively on reducing our SG&A costs which declined $56 million year over year.  SG&A as a percent of revenue from home sales was 15.9% which increased 20 basis points from last year due to lower revenues in the current year. Throughout this downturn, we have implemented aggressive cost reduction initiatives resulting in a lean and efficient structure and as volumes are expected to increase in the fourth quarter, we expect to see the benefits of leveraging these cost reduction initiatives that we’ve already implemented.  New orders narrowed their year over year decline to 8% and backlog improved 20% sequentially from our second quarter. The cancellation rate was 19% for the quarter versus 27% in the prior year’s quarter and in the third quarter we started approximately 3,100 homes to match the improved sales pace of 3,100 new orders.  This positions us well for stronger deliveries in our fourth quarter. Our backlog conversion ratio was 130% in the quarter versus 96% in the prior year’s quarter. Last quarter we indicated that we do expect our third quarter backlog conversion ratio to decline sequentially from the 191% in Q2, as we significantly reduced the number of completed unsold homes.  Our financial services segment earned an $11.2 million profit this quarter despite lower revenues and this compared with a $12.9 million loss in the prior year. Our mortgage pre-tax improved to a profit of $9.8 million from a loss of $13.2 million in the prior year and our title company earned $1.5 million this quarter compared with a loss of $600,000 in the prior year.  The company is financially strong and our strategies have positioned us well towards rebuilding profitability. And with that I’d like to turn it over for your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Goldberg - UBS
David Goldberg - UBS: Nice quarter, first question is about the finished lots that you are purchasing and Bruce thanks for the detail on the amount that you said on the finished lots, I’m trying to get an idea of how long it takes do you think on average to bring those lots through the process, sell the homes and actually deliver them. What do you think the cash conversion cycle is on lots that you’re purchasing today. 
Stuart Miller : In most instances, we’re looking at homesites that would be started on almost immediately after being taken down. In many of those cases we’re taking down homesites only as we need them. In a rare instance we might be buying a group of homesites which would generally be in the 20 to 30 range.  But in all instances the homesites would be ready to start almost immediately and when I say that, within a week, two weeks, at most a month. And then the construction cycle would be the natural construction cycle for the product in the particular division, that might range anywhere from three months to six months.  So we’re looking at a rapid turnover of that inventory. 
David Goldberg - UBS: The follow-up question was if we can get a little bit more into new homes, and more specifically how we as investors can kind of evaluate what is longer-term investment and I know you commented there were no further cash obligations to you but in terms of potential cash spend do you potentially see that you might have to put or choose to put more cash in and how we could evaluate that as we look forward, the success of the investment and what the eventual return is to you. 
Stuart Miller : Well let’s think about that, first of all as it relates to the Newhall investment, there will be no additional outlays. In fact embedded in the amount of money invested, was a reserve for future expenditures that are needed for the development of the Newhall properties.  So its already prefunded and that’s included in the investment that we’ve already put forth. So relative to that specific investment, I think that we can expect that there will be no outlays. There is the opportunity within that structure to look at and purchase other opportunities out there and so from an opportunistic standpoint should our partners decide along with us that there is a unique opportunity, we could make an investment in another property that is a like kind of distress investment.  But it is purely at our option and only if we see a unique opportunity. 
David Goldberg - UBS: And in terms of the evaluation. 
Stuart Miller : I’m sorry, maybe I didn’t understand that part of the question. 
David Goldberg - UBS: Just trying to look forward to see how we can evaluate the success of the investment and the return back to you as a company. What’s the right way to think about the success of your investments, the $140.
Stuart Miller : I think to be straight, its going to be fairly opaque. You’re probably not going to be able to segregate it out of the numbers that you see. The underwriting of the investment was to a very aggressive standard by us and all of the participants in that program.  And its just a very attractive deal that we think is going to yield us attractive returns as we go forward but I don’t think you’re going to be able to segregate it out. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt – Wells Fargo
Carl Reichardt – Wells Fargo: Just a follow-up on David’s question, did you mention that you expect some SG&A savings from LandSource’s [pre-creation]. Obviously, I know you shifted, there’s been some folks that have moved over there. Can you quantify that, is it minimal, or is it something significant. 
Stuart Miller : We haven’t put a number out there but I think that its probably around $5 million, but that’s a guesstimate and I don’t want you to hang your hat on it. And it results from the fact that the management team that had been overseeing LandSource and some other investments has actually moved off to be its own independent company running that investment and doing some other things as well.  So that is a significant savings to the company. 
Carl Reichardt – Wells Fargo: And then just to follow-up and back on this issue of the divisions purchasing lots on a finished lot basis and I’m, I just want to make sure I understand the separation of land and homebuilding in your mind Stuart is really a function of development activity or more longer-term, lower return, perhaps high margin opportunities versus quick turn, finished lots, so that we can expect the company to continue to actively buy finished lots and turn them quick. Is that how you see the separation or am I missing something. 
Stuart Miller : No I think that’s, I think you’ve probably said it better then I generally do, but that’s exactly what we see. We are inclined to forego the higher margin and lower turn opportunities in favor of the higher turn opportunities. We want to keep it short-term. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen East - Pali Research
Stephen East - Pali Research: First question revolves around what you talked about sequentially your orders were growing throughout the quarter, can you talk about how that compares to historical and are you able to quantify any tax credit benefit in that. 
Stuart Miller : To just answer the last part first, I think that the tax credit was pretty stable all the way through. I guess except for California. And we didn’t see much of a drop off as the California credit fell off. So it seems that it acted as an adequate spark to get some things going and that spark has kind of maintained itself.  I think that falling interest rates have probably helped that along a little bit and I think we can’t underestimate just the general air of consumer confidence that’s kind of come back. Does it match up with historical trends? I think not. Generally the third quarter is, it kind of moves around a little bit historically.  I think that it is somewhat of an anomaly that through the summer time you would see that the sales increased as we have this summer time. But I don’t have the actual facts on that and so we see it as somewhat of a trend forming but we’ll have to wait and see. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: And then on the second part of it, did I hear you correctly that in the fourth quarter by year end all divisions will be both profitable and cash flow positive and if so, it seems like your JV’s are diverging a little bit from your core business from a profitability perspective, I just wanted to get some color on why that’s happening. 
Stuart Miller : Well I was careful not to use the word all because I don’t want to fall off if there are a couple of divisions that haven’t quite gotten there. So, but as we have mapped out our divisions, division by division, right now it looks like just about every division will be cash flow positive and profitable.  And Bruce maybe you could speak to as it relates to the ventures. 
Bruce Gross : As it relates to the ventures, you have to set aside first the impairments and then what’s remaining in the ventures, there are some associated costs to carry in some of the ventures and we’re very focused on the ventures as we are with the rest of the business to try to bring those numbers back as close as we can to profitability.  But from a division-to-division standpoint you’ll see most of the joint ventures more heavily weighted out in the western side of the country and as we’re looking at divisions getting back to profitability, we’re taking into account as we go into next year, that those will also be included in the analysis.  Bruce maybe you could speak to Okay so are you implying then that the west is a little bit less profitable from a JV standpoint then the rest of the country. 
Stuart Miller :  I would say that right now it has been materially less profitable [inaudible] when you include joint ventures so let’s just be straight with it. And there, we anticipate that as we get into 2010 that even inclusive of the weight of the ventures in the west that we expect that we should be profitable across our core business and that’s inclusive of the ventures, so that’s what we’re looking at right now. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan: First question, if its possible to get a little bit more color on the improvement that you saw month to month during the quarter in terms of if August, will you go as far to say that it turned positive year over year and also if you could give some regional context to perhaps on a month to month basis where you saw perhaps some more improvement relative to other regions. 
Bruce Gross : I would just say that the improvement sequentially was there month to month both on the sales as well in the reduction of sales incentives. Looking at it month to month, year over year, we haven’t really run those numbers exactly but there was clearly sequential improvement both in the pricing as well as the sales pace and it was pretty consistent across our regions. 
Stuart Miller : I don’t think that we can say that year over year, the answer to the question was August positive year over year, I don’t, I haven’t looked at the numbers but its too tough a comparison to look on a monthly basis. Frankly quarterly is a little difficult too. But in any given month we might be running a special or some kind of a special program which might throw that month out of sync when you look year over year so I think that we’re all looking for some positive signs out there to kind of confirm a sense that the market is improving.  And all I can say about the sequential improvement is that it was clearly there. It was clearly felt and it feels like we’re at the beginning of something that might be real.  
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan: Second question just on, you mentioned that you’ve been increasing the number of starts to better match sales pace and actually gave the number of started 3,100 homes to match the orders, so is it fair to say then that you’re not necessarily getting more aggressive from a spec standpoint, obviously you still reduced completed spec during the quarter. Is this more just getting into a higher state of readiness or on the margin, do you feel more confident maybe to add let’s say, one spec per community given that you have a higher level of traffic and order pace. 
Stuart Miller : No we’re clearly not increasing the level of specs and to the contrary we’re continuing to tighten up in that regard. We are very focused on looking for that moment where we start to get some pricing power and we feel that by keeping the spec level at a minimum we’ll be able to get that pricing power if and when it does return. I noted that some of our incentives have started to be reduced which is a reflection of a little bit of pricing power in some of our markets. We see that a little bit more along the eastern seaboard, maybe a little bit in California. But by keeping our spec count really tight, we’re going to be able to manage that profit the best and really generate the best profitability for the company. 
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan:  Good to hear, one quick technical question if I could, Bruce I think you highlighted in the cash flow that you spent about $77 million on finished lots and I assume, is that safe to assume that’s the amount that you’ve been referring to throughout the call in terms of the specific finished lots investments in the eastern seaboard, Florida and Texas, California. 
Stuart Miller : That’s correct. 
Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan: And can you give us an idea of the number of lots that you’re tying up through this.
Bruce Gross : Well including the communities we’ve purchased out of LandSource, we did acquire approximately 3,600 finished homesites, or primarily finished homesites, throughout the quarter. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin - Citi
Josh Levin - Citi: I wanted to ask about your comments on the land market, you said that as Lennar you saw some good land deals and you made some land purchases, but with regards to Rialto you said still premature, so maybe you could elaborate a little bit on what explains the difference between what Lennar is doing and seeing and what Rialto is doing and seeing. 
Stuart Miller : That’s a good question, and we haven’t provided a lot of detail on Rialto but Rialto is doing a lot of what we have kind of as part of our DNA and that is kind of out there looking for pure distress and opportunities to not only participate but to provide solid management and expertise. And its broader than just residential home building. So for example, many have noted that Rialto is a participant in the PPIP program along with Alliance, [inaudible], and a couple of other partners, we are one of the nine designated managers and are currently out raising capital. We will invest in the PPIP program along with other capital partners and Rialto will be a co-manager.  We will participate in those kinds of opportunities. The money is not yet raised and the opportunity set is not yet defined but it might include pieces of RMBS or CMBS tranches that become available. So it’s a really different business segment that is a piece of what we have done historically and created tremendous value with.  And for those who are familiar with the LNR history, this is a program that is very much along those same lines. So the opportunity set that is different relative to Rialto is Rialto is not likely to be a land investor or pure land investor but views its opportunities that is much wider and those opportunities have not yet quite presented themselves.
Josh Levin – Citi: My next question is on gross margins, Lennar’s gross margins continue to be above average relative to its peers and that’s regardless of whether you’re selling lots of spec or not selling lots of specs, why do you think you’re able to keep producing these above average margins relative to your peers. 
Bruce Gross : I think its hard to compare to the peers, but what we could say with Lennar is we were early to the impairment process. We started early in the cycle. We’ve been very successful in redesigning our product and focusing on the first time and the value focused buyer. And we’ve made great improvements in our construction cost per square foot.  I can’t speak for the others, but I know that we’ve been very focused on bringing down our land basis which we’ve done successfully through the impairment process and bringing down our construction costs as well. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Megan Talbott McGath – Barclays Capital
Megan Talbott McGath – Barclays Capital: I wanted to follow-up on Mike’s question earlier about ramping up production, the 3,100 that you started this quarter, can you just give us any color on what that’s like versus a normal quarter. Do you normally start about your number of orders, 50%, 60%, what is that normally look like. 
Bruce Gross : The way I would think about it is we’re more focused on presales now so we’re trying to match better but we think that there’s more opportunity to improve margin as Stuart mentioned as we’re pre-selling more then we have been in the past. In some of the last few quarters because there was a higher cancelation rate that existed out there, there was more inventory on the ground so that there was less opportunity to focus on the presales. 
Megan Talbott McGath – Barclays Capital: And then I just wanted to see if we could get any more color on the incentive picture, are the incentives that are going away the ones more likely at the closing table asking for a final price cut, or is it more sort of in the beginning of the process. Any specific patterns you’re seeing there. 
Stuart Miller : No, and I have to be honest, I don’t have the detailed knowledge to be able to speak with certainty but I will say I think that the incentives at the closing table are pretty much a part of history. We’re seeing very little of that except as it relates to closing where there’s an appraisal problem. And that means that for whatever reason, an appraiser might have come in with a low appraisal and whether you sell the home to this purchaser or anyone else, you’re not going to get around it.  But in terms of pure negotiation the incentives at the closing table are pretty much behind. Is there additional color on the incentives, the answer is probably not. The reduction in incentives right now is still pretty small and I think we’re going to have to sit and wait for the fourth quarter to really see what this trend looks like.  So I hope that we’ll be able to give a little bit more color at the end of the fourth, but for right now it just feels like the environment is getting a little bit better. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs: In your comments about 2010 profitability, are you looking to be profitable in each quarter of 2010 or are you simply talking about profitability as you exit the year and in addition to that could you talk about, I assume you are expecting further improvement on the gross margin line as you deliver home on newer lots. Could you talk about the SG&A leverage that you expect to come through the numbers next year. Can you put any figures around how much of the costs you’ve cut do not need to come back or how much revenue you can add without adding an addition dollar of SG&A.
Stuart Miller : To speak to your first question first, I’ve tried to be careful to say that I think that there’s a positive trend or a sense of a positive trend that is starting to define itself in the marketplace, but I don’t think that we yet have visibility as to too many specifics as we go forward. We’re certainly running along, if we’re seeing stability, we’re running along a very rocky bottom, and I think that to try to quantify too much as we look ahead, would probably be a mistake. Are we going to be profitable every quarter as we go forward, I’m going to have to say that as it relates to too much detail looking ahead, I’m going to have to leave that an open question right now.  That’s what we’re solving to, but I do think that there are going to be ups and downs in the marketplace and I don’t want to misrepresent something. 
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs: That’s understood. Have you started to run the analysis on whether or not you could be both profitable in 2010 and cash flow positive. 
Stuart Miller : We have run that analysis. We’ve done it on a division-by-division basis and we’ve done it at the corporate level and we think that we can be both cash flow positive and profitable in 2010. 
Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs: Just a technical one, what was your community count in the quarter and what was your cash flow to joint ventures if you have those two numbers. 
Bruce Gross : The community count is in the low 400 number, its about 410 communities. Again keep in mind some of those are at the very tail end so its often a misleading number. As far as the cash flow with the joint ventures, there are a few moving pieces during the quarter because we did spend about $140 million relating to LandSource.  But relative to cash contributions for the quarter outside of LandSource we did contribute a portion of the recourse reduction and there was some capital that went into the unconsolidated entities. We’ll provide more detail as we get through the 10-Q with an exact number for you but I would look at it that about half of the maximum recourse reduction this quarter came from Lennar so approximately half of that reduction from [$422] to $380 million, and then there were some other capital contributions beyond that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood - Deutche Bank
Nishu Sood - Deutche Bank: Just wanted to follow-up on Joshua’s question about the 2010 guidance and the return to profitability, you already obviously have mentioned a little bit about operating leverage, I wanted to understand what the trajectories of impairments versus gross profit would look like. Would you expect one to improve let’s say a couple of quarters before the other one, either the gross profit or the impairments or is it going to be coincident, what do you think that will look like for you for next year. 
Stuart Miller : I would think that you’re going to see coincident improvement. It makes sense. We’ve still been in a declining environment and recognizing that, the impairment cycle doesn’t finish until you stop declining. It seems to me that as you start to see stabilization and ultimately recovery, that would, and of course it won’t happen in all markets at the same time.  We’ll report national numbers but they will be a compilation of a lot of mixes and matches. It seems to be that as the market stops declining, margins should improve at the same time because prices are at least stabilizing or going up a little bit and/or incentives fading away.  And at the same time there’s no further need to make impairment adjustments. So while that will happen in different markets at different times, I would think that you’d see a coincident improvement. 
Nishu Sood - Deutche Bank: That’s helpful. I guess what’s implicit in my question is the timing difference between when you decide, when you look around at the conditions, you decide to impair an asset and then when it ultimately flows through your, when you ultimately close on it, and in fact related to that, there was an interesting disclosure or just a kind of comment in your press release this morning, and I think you had it last quarter but not before that, that your impairments actually do not ever relate to closings within the same quarter. So that there is some type of delay. Now that just might have been a change to your language. I wanted to focus in on that a little bit because I was under the impression that occasionally you might impair something that would actually flow through and you might actually close the same quarter. Has there been a change in the timing differential, might that reflect differences in what kinds of assets you’re impairing. Earlier on in the cycle maybe you were impairing more standing inventory, now its more land that’s further out. So maybe you could just kind of help me understand what that disclosure meant as it relates to the time between the impairment and the closing. 
Bruce Gross : To the extent there is a land sale during the quarter we treat any loss as an impairment. Okay so that’s one disclosure that we have been careful to clarify. 
David Collins: You might be referring to the non-GAAP financial measure disclosure that we have in there. We’ve always disclosed gross margins excluding impairments and including impairments. The non-GAAP financial measure just adds some color on how certain adjustments flow through margin and we wanted to separate because the impairments we take on the homebuilding side relate to homes that are not closed.  We wanted to show what our true margins are for homes that we deliver during the period which is excluding impairments and then we also disclose gross margins on home sales including impairments. So we just wanted to clear up that we were showing both sides of the gross margin in and out. 
Nishu Sood - Deutche Bank: So there’s been no change to clarification of the way things have been. 
David Collins: No change, just further color. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in terms of SG&A and if housing conditions were worsening you talked about getting down to 10%, clearly the revenues should start to improve soon with this and so I [inaudible], just by better margins, but do you still have the goal of getting to 10% SG&A, what’s the timing do you think around that. 
Stuart Miller : The answer is yes, and we’re still very focused on it for this year-end.
Daniel Oppenheim - Credit Suisse: And then secondly, there’s a lot of talk in terms of the better environment and looking at the finished land opportunities, how are you looking at the developing on the raw land that you have currently. Are we getting close to the point where you could do that or still some time away. If so what would it take to get there. 
Stuart Miller : Its still going to take some time before the development of raw land in most instances will make a lot of financial sense. And we’re clearly looking at every dollar spent as a dollar that needs to be held accountable for its own return on investment.  So investment in development dollars, in development right now, does not return adequately to merit the investment and that’s why we’re looking primarily at buying homesites at a lower price then you could actually develop in many instances today. And that’s where our production will come from. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless - FTN Equity 
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity : Have the sequentially improving conditions you say during the quarter carried over to September. 
Stuart Miller : We really don’t comment on the next quarter but since I don’t comment I won’t say that things seem to be holding consistently as we go forward.
Jay McCanless - FTN Equity : Understood, my second question is on the credit and on what we’ve been hearing from other builders about the quick move business, in terms of being very tight on your spec counts, or do you believe that you may be giving up some sales at the margin just to make, to be more conservative or do you feel like that the natural spec creation through cancellations, if that’s meeting that opportunity well enough. 
Stuart Miller : That’s kind of the age old question in homebuilding and I think that the argument can always be made and always is made by a sales force that we’re giving up sales because we don’t have more spec on the ground and its possible that we are. But our balance right now tells us that we’re going to have more purchasing power then we will lose sales.  And so we’re going to stick with the low inventory level and we think that the natural inventory as you pointed out is sufficient to pick up the lion share of the sales that we might otherwise lose. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ken Zener - Macquarie
Ken Zener - Macquarie: You have two times backlog with units under construction, it seems like you have plenty of units out there. Can you talk about the propensity to build spec on these new lots that you’re purchasing verse waiting for an order. 
Stuart Miller : We are very reluctant to build any spec. We’re not treating any of the new homesites differently then the already existing ones. And our program is very much the same. We’re not out there chasing the opportunity to add production. We want to do it profitably on a home-by-home basis. 
Ken Zener - Macquarie: What is your owned lot count and can you give a little bit more color around the land bids, you spent $77 million but was that maybe 20% of your bids went through and could you give us a little flavor of competitive bids, pricing, and why you think you lost on the deals that you did. 
Bruce Gross : Let me answer the first question, our owned home site count increased to approximately 78,000 this quarter. 
Stuart Miller : I wouldn’t venture a guess as to how many of our bids actually went through. The reason that we lost on some of the bids that we lost on is because someone else bid higher. But no, I think that—
Ken Zener - Macquarie: Did you sense that it was from more aggressive people that had a less deep land supply or they were perhaps more, greater liquidity, or I assume true investors would be paying, unlevered investors you’d be able to beat on a pricing dynamic, so did you get any feedback from your field operations. 
Stuart Miller : There’s really not a consistent theme. We’re trying to, you and I are trying to have a discussion about national numbers, when in actual fact its such a local phenomenon. In some instances we’ve been outbid by small local builders that are using leverage. Its basically a levered bid in one form or another.  In other instances it’s a national builder that might have a specific need in a particular market. I think that there’s clearly been an uptick in the number of participants looking for homesites. And when finished homesites come to market, multiple bidders are showing up today. But the underwriting by and large is still pretty carefully done.  We have seen some instances where we’ve been surprised at the prices that have been paid. And we’re staying away from that. We’re not chasing pricing but we’re measuring our program very carefully.  I’d have to say that we’re losing more bids then we’re winning but the ones that we’re getting we’re very comfortable with.  I’d like to thank everybody for joining us. I apologize for those who have questions that we weren’t able to get to. Certainly Bruce, Scott, and myself, we’re all available to have an offline discussion. I’d like to thank everybody for joining us for our third quarter and look forward to reporting year-end.

Operator: I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Yes. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2008 and year-end 2008 earnings update. I am joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer; and David Collins, our Controller. Bruce will provide additional detail on our numbers and as is traditional, David will give you an update on our asset review and impairments, a report that we have done for just out for years now and Diane of course will be available to participate in our question-and-answer period. And just as a housekeeping item before I start, I would like to request that in our question-and-answer period that will follow my opening, and Bruce's and David's opening remarks that you please limit to just one question, one follow-up, so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. Of course, we welcome you to rejoin the queue and as time permits, we will answer as many questions as we can. Let me start by saying that against the backdrop of what I would say, is clearly the most difficult housing market that I and I dare say any of those of us in the housing industry have ever encountered, Lennar's management team and associates have put forth an extremely productive quarter. We continue to focus on the basics of rebuilding our operating business, while we have continued to, carefully manage our asset base and we have worked diligently to rework and reposition our joint ventures. We are making credible progress toward stability and ultimately profitability in the most difficult times. Now with that said, I would like to start my comments this morning by giving what I think is a clear view of the troubled market conditions, in which we are operating, and recognize that at the end of the day I feel rather optimistic that this condition is going to correct itself as the government continues to intervene. But I do think that it is important for all of you to understand the market conditions as we see them today. So as we look out home prices and volumes are clearly right now free falling as general economic pressures are driving a downward spiral that simply does not have a natural end. Foreclosures continue to add inventory to an already saturated market, while each movement downward in home values sparks a new wave of homeowners, unwilling to support an asset that is even more under water, relative to their mortgage. Growing unemployment and fear of job loss exacerbates the predisposition to default on mortgage payments, while hope that the government will bail out defaulted home loans makes the default less of a decision. Sellers in this market are primarily liquidators, ever more prone to accept any offer in order to move today's inventory to make way for the mounting backlog of defaulted loans that are moving ever more slowly through the foreclosure process. Now on the other hand, natural primary purchasers are on the sidelines. The purchase of foreclosed homes is more of a professional business than a selection of a dream home. Many of the foreclosed homes are in disrepair and the negotiation process is cumbersome. Participating in this part of the market requires a unique familiarity with diligence and patience that is not easily understood and natural purchasers, fear that if they do not get a uniquely priced problem home then they are simply paying too much. Traditional sellers, that is, homeowners and homebuilders, are not able to sell homes unless they offer even greater discounts and keep up with liquidation values. The movement to keep people in their homes and to rework defaulted loans is frankly frustrated, by the inability of banks and servicers to actually communicate with their borrowers, and reworked loans are defaulting at an alarming reported 50% to 60% rate in the first three to six months. And the slowing rate of foreclosures is more in the nature of convenient rhetoric than actual accomplishment and making a dent in the mounting foreclosure pressure will be slow and complicated. Month after month market conditions have been slowing the number of transactions. Purchasers are losing conviction and while the reported number of transactions, new and existing home sales, and closings continues to hover around the $5 million [hallmark], an increasing number of potential purchasers are canceling purchases made and opting to stay on the sidelines. Traditional laws of supply and demand are just not working. Unnatural sellers and unnatural buyers are driving prices downward at an unstoppable rate. The more values drop, the more homeowners default on their mortgages, either out of necessity or out of frustration and the subprime foreclosure problem is spreading to Alt-A and prime mortgages as well. And as purchasers become increasingly concerned with the value of their largest asset, their home, they have stopped spending on other products as well. They simply feel poorer. Overall consumption in the economy has continued to drop and unemployment has continued to rise. Many are losing their job or feel in jeopardy of losing their job. With overall consumer sentiment falling and failing, fewer potential home purchasers are willing to enter the market. Frankly, we are in the midst of a downward spiral and momentum has been building. The problems of falling home values are broadly affecting the overall economy. As values fall, consumers are driven from the market because of their impaired balance sheet, and banks and investors are similarly driven from the market because of the impairment to their balance sheets derived, from falling asset values or asset-backed security values that are dependent on those assets. Homebuilders have been at the front of this trend and have seen this trend evolving. And it has been our belief that if we do not take positive action to break this downward cycle, the housing market and the overall economy will not find equilibrium on its own. In the context of these now well-documented conditions, I remain generally optimistic about where we are going from here. I feel that the problems that define our industry and for that matter our economy, are now revealed and recognized. I have said for many quarters, that the bright light at the end of housings dark tunnel will be governmental action taken to stop the downward spiral. And I have said that since that once someone connects the dot, they will fashion a solution that will include a meaningful fix for housing and the slide will subside, a floor will be formed and we can begin a recovery. I am optimistic because, we are at the threshold of a new governmental regime that is not saddled with the responsibility of having created the problem and can therefore take dramatic action to change the environment without being defensive. The new administration is truly enabled by the fact that the problem is revealed, they did not create it and everyone wants it fixed. I am optimistic because, the new administration appears to be dynamic, thoughtful and intelligent. We are already seeing a government that is being formed to be ready from day one to be prepared and active. The named participants are smart capable actors that are not newcomers to their arena. Deliberate thought is being given to new programs and politics as usual, seems to be set aside in favor of decisive actions. I am optimistic because, I am confident that the new administration will make housing an important part of their blueprint for economic recovery. So, what is the fix? At the end of the day, the drive to fix housing will have two components. First, we will continue to seek to stem the flow of foreclosures and will seek to keep homeowners in their homes. Banks, our MBS servicers and the FDIC will continue to modify loans and work with borrowers in order to avoid foreclosures. The government together with credible actors in the private sector will continue work already underway to balance the virtues of helping families keep their homes, while minimizing the moral hazard of rewarding defaulted borrowers. As these actions are implemented and perfected, the supply of available homes on the market will stop accelerating. The most significant action that can be taken to keep families in their homes however, will be the second component. Demand stimulus will be needed and implemented in order to stop the fall in home values. We are already seeing the beginnings of this second component as the Federal Reserve has adopted meaningful measures to begin to drive mortgage rates downward. But a great deal more will have to be done to get buyers off the fence and back into the market, in order to stop the slide in home values and absorb existing inventories. At the end of the day, we will need a program that will jump start primary buyers back into the market in numbers that will enable 6 million to 7 million transactions a year. As a floor in values is found, fewer families will slide into the abyss of underwater mortgages and there will be fewer defaults. Materially lower interest rates will enable existing homeowners to refinance at affordable fixed rates and stabilized values will enable appraisers to support refinances. At the end of the day housings fix will contribute to three important components of economic healing. When families buy homes, good things happen. After a home is purchased, families purchase things for their home, they buy drapes and furniture, they buy appliances and televisions. They begin consuming and that helps the overall economy. As housing assets stabilize banks balance sheet stops depleting and banks start lending again. Banks that are lending become profitable and can start to repair themselves. Finally, when people purchase home, existing homes are improved and new homes are built and that means employment. As I look ahead, I am optimistic. I fundamentally believe that things always look darkest just before the fix and things are looking adequately dark, right now. Against that backdrop let me say, that in the fourth quarter as I said the housing market continue to deteriorate at an accelerated rate. And against that backdrop, we have made meaningful progress with our fourth quarter and year-end results. With market conditions as they are, we continue to accept the fact that some things are just out of our control and we are simply not going to be able to alter those elements. But the items that we can control, we continue to be all over them in each of our divisions. As is customary, at the end of each quarter our senior management team recently visited with each of our divisions, as we did our quarterly operations review. A review of our reported number shows the meaningful progress that we found in each of our divisions. We continue to rebuild our gross margin, which shows the continued improvement of some 490 basis points year-over-year before valuation adjustments to 17%. Our operating margin before valuation adjustments has improved some 580 basis points to almost 3%, producing a slight operating loss for the quarter of approximately $7 million. While a portion of this improvement, no doubt derives from impairments previously taken, as David will cover in just a few minutes, an increasing proportion stems from a focused reengineering of our product, materially reduced construction costs, and a determined attention to right sizing our SG&A which stands at, what is still a somewhat disappointing 14.1% of lower than expected revenues. Nevertheless, our SG&A is down some $132 million year-over-year for the quarter, or a 100 basis points year-over-year. We have continued a quarterly progression of positive trends in this distressed market environment, which positions the company well for rebound in the future. And while this progression will likely stall in the first quarter as our backlog has been depleted by high cancellations, the foundation on which it is built will hold us in good stead throughout the next year. A few basic highlights show that while gross margin has fallen slightly from 18% in the third quarter to 17% this quarter, operating margin has nevertheless improved from 2.3% in the third to 2.9% this quarter. And pretax loss before impairment and a one-time gain has remained stable at approximately a $7 million loss. Unfortunately, impairments continue to increase due to a dramatic fall in market conditions in the fourth quarter from approximately $150 million in the third quarter to approximately $221 million in the fourth. With market conditions still extremely soft though our operating progress overall, is meaningful. On the asset management front, we have continued to fortify our company by continuing to manage and restate our land assets, while we simultaneously carefully manage our inventory of completed homes in the face of increased cancellations and reduced the number and composition of joint ventures. In fact, we have reduced the number of joint ventures from 270 at the peak to a 116 currently, and that is down from the 146 last quarter. We have reworked or close to rework on most of our joint ventures and the trend on our JVs is positive. Our overall land asset is down similarly and great progress has been made on the asset side of the business. So management can focus on sales, construction and SG&A. And today we are a leaner operating machine, and are well prepared for when market conditions stabilize. On the corporate side, we have complemented the progress in the field. Our balance sheet remains strong with a substantial cash position of $1.1 billion. That position is further fortified by the approximately $230 million that we received to year end as a tax refund. This cash position enables us to continue to seize opportunity, where distress creates unique value, rather than walk away from that opportunity, and we anticipate that we will continue to use cash available to harvest value and opportunity from our joint ventures as they arise. Additionally, there is nothing borrowed on our revolver and we have a responsible debt to total cap position of 49%, and net of cash that is 37.5%. In the wake of the meaningful restatements of assets that we have undergone, the repositioning of many of our joint ventures and the taking of a $730 million tax asset reserve gives this meaningful progress. And, although, we have continued to lose money in our fourth quarter with the loss per share of $5.12, aggregate levels of impairments and losses are in the nature of adjustment to moving market conditions and these adjustments are to a much smaller asset base. As I have said in prior quarters, we have done the heavy lifting on impairments and are now situated with stated assets that can and will produce improving margins when the rate of decline and market pricing subsides. And we are confident that even with a continued degradation of market conditions our stated asset base will not suffer, nearly the levels of impairments that we have seen in the past. Additionally, in the fourth quarter we have begun to mature our go-forward strategy relative to our overall company structure. As has been customary throughout Lennar's history, as we have weathered numerous housing cycles, we have been preparing to be a significant participant in distressed opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles. Approximately a year and a half ago Jeff Krasnoff came back to the company and began to incubate the management team that would be focused on distressed opportunity as it was presented. The team is now formed, and we have launched a program to raise independent capital to combine with this team, to deal with the significant asset dislocation that has occurred. While it is still premature to be making asset purchases right now, our strategy going forward will be to segregate our homebuilding manufacturing program from our more capital intensive asset opportunity program, much as we did in the early 1990s, as we built what became LNR Property Corporation. We are can confident that as the market corrects and ultimately it will that we will be able to create meaningful value for the company through this vehicle. In conclusion, let me say that, we have made a great deal of progress in very difficult market conditions. We have prepared our company for market conditions as they currently exist and we are not projecting material improvement for some time to come. But as I have said before, this should not be confused with abject pessimism. In fact, I remain quite optimistic about our business and about the housing market in general. We have made significant progress in repositioning our business as a scaled down and lean operation. We have adequate resources to weather the difficult market conditions that are in front of us and we continue to focus on the operational elements that will drive us to profitability and continued cash flow in the future. Although it is difficult to find reason to be optimistic in these truly unprecedented turbulent market conditions, I believe that the market will rebound. It will have to, in order to stimulate the rest of the economy back to its feet. And as the market finds a bottom and begins a recovery, we at Lennar will be well positioned to participate. Bruce?
Bruce Gross: Thank you, Stuart and good morning. As Stuart discussed this was a quarter that we made significant progress in the company, and I will provide some of the financial details supporting that progress. Our focus again this quarter was further strengthening our balance sheet liquidity and that was the number one priority. Stuart mentioned there was $1.1 billion of homebuilding cash on the balance sheet. That improved from $857 million at the end of the third quarter. So, we generated positive cash flow this quarter and that was a result of our operational focus on significantly reducing land purchases, executing a high backlog conversion ratio and aggressively controlling costs, which I will discuss further in a minute. So now, Lennar has generated positive operating cash flow each year for more than a decade and this was in years of both significant growth, as well as in years of significant decline in housing as we have seen more recently. We mentioned after yearend, we immediately filed the tax return and received in our cash account $230 million of cash relating to a tax loss carry back. Additionally, we ended the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and during the quarter, we were successful in amending that credit facility to provide greater flexibility under our covenants and that facility commitment is now $1.1 billion and matures in July of 2011. Our homebuilding debt to total capital net of cash, the number is 35.7% at the end of the year that compared with 30.2% in the prior years fourth quarter. When you look at our debt maturities going forward, they are spread out pretty nicely over the next 8 years through 2016, and there is no major refinance risk in any year. Since the downturn began, there has been a lot of concern that Lennar's joint ventures would erode Lennar's liquidity as a result of recourse debt guarantees or supporting non-recourse JV obligations of debt. As we have continued to add transparency to our SEC quarterly filings, we knew the best transparency would be looking at the company's financial position as these JVs are significantly reduced. And during the quarter, the company has continued its aggressive focus on reducing the number of joint ventures. From the peak of 270 in 2006, we dissolved about 100 joint ventures this year, and that is leaving 116 joint ventures left at the end of the fourth quarter. Of these remaining joint ventures, only 41 have recourse debt, 27 have non-recourse debt, and 48 have no debt at all. We continue to make significant progress with reducing maximum recourse indebtedness with our unconsolidated JVs, which has been reduced now by 71% to $520 million at the end of the year, since the peak of $1.8 billion at the end of 2006. This year's progress was significant as we are well ahead of schedule with respect to our bank covenant on maximum JV recourse debt, which was $735 million of maximum recourse debt at the end of the fourth quarter. The total cash payments made during the quarter for remargining relating to maintenance guarantees with our JVs was $26 million and for the total year, it was $74 million. As a result of the consolidation of four joint ventures, there was an increase in Lennar's debt balance on its books of approximately $200 million during the quarter. Although these JVs were consolidated for accounting purposes, the risk profile of the joint ventures has not changed and the debt is primarily non-recourse debt. The company has not supported non-recourse debt throughout this downturn and non-recourse debt will continue to remain non-recourse to the company. We have said that our JVs have been strategic and in this significant housing recession, our joint ventures have enabled us to share the decline in land and housing values with our partners. And this is worked as intended and has positioned Lennar with a lower land balance on its balance sheet and therefore has less exposure to future land impairments. As we all know wholly-owned land takes 100% of the loss from declining land prices, so we have less exposure with that lower land balance today. Our current financial position of ample liquidity, low leverage, reduced risk with our joint ventures, a balance sheet with less land exposure and no significant debt refinance risk, highlights the growing strength of the company's balance sheet as the market has continued to weaken. We have continued to carefully manage our inventory levels as they are down approximately $250 million sequentially from our third quarter, to $3.8 billion excluding consolidated inventory not owned. The progress was primarily due to aggressively reducing land purchases to only $64 million during the quarter, which is approximately 75% below the quarterly land purchase run-rate through the first nine months of 2008. Additionally, our land development spend was reduced significantly and looking forward should continue to be minimal, due to our focus on purchasing finished homesites only, when needed under our land light strategy. The finished homes and construction in progress inventory was reduced sequentially from $2.2 billion to $2.1 billion and land under development including option deposits, was also reduced sequentially from $1.8 billion to $1.7 billion. Homes under construction declined sequentially by about a third from 6,300 in the third quarter of '08 to 4,200 in the fourth quarter. Our unsold completed homes increased during the quarter to 1,140 but that was primarily driven by an increase in the cancellation rate from 27% in the third quarter to 32% sequentially in the fourth quarter. We have been very successful with our focus on reducing the number of completed unsold homes throughout this downturn and we fully expect again that we will bring this number down significantly in the first quarter of 2009. Our homesites owned and controlled were reduced by 67% since the peak in 2006 from 345,000 homesites to 114,000 homesites and included in this number are 74,000 homesites owned, 13,000 controlled with third-parties and approximately 26,000 auctioned from joint ventures. We had substantial equity at the end of the quarter $2.6 billion and that equates to a book value per share of about $16.34. Turning to the operating results for the quarter, as Stuart mentioned, we had approximately a $7 million operating loss when you look at it on a pretax basis, before impairments and before the recognition of a gain on the recapitalization relating to land source, where we had deferred profit going back to 2007. In the fourth quarter, we increased our EBIT before evaluation adjustments to approximately $159 million and that compares to a $57 million EBIT loss in the prior year's fourth quarter. The 40% decline in revenues from home sales was driven by a 34% decrease in home deliveries and a 10% reduction in average sales price to $262,000. The average sales price is net of sales incentives, which averaged about $51,400 per home that compares to $58,800 in the prior year's fourth quarter. During the year, our Houston operations comprised more than 10% of total revenues and as a result, we are required to move Houston from the central region to its own reporting segment beginning this quarter. The average sales price changed by segment as follows. The east was 244,000 down 14%, the central was 201,000 down 8%, the west was 356,000 down 15%, Houston was 198,000 up 4% and other region was 280,000 up 5%. Stuart mentioned our success with our gross margin, SG&A and operating margin statistics. The 2.9% operating margin is the fourth quarter in a row of operating margin improvement going back to the fourth quarter of last year that is up 490 basis points over the prior year. Again that improvement in gross margin year-over-year is, due both to a lower land basis, as well as lower construction costs. We continue to make progress on our construction costs per square foot, which has been reduced by more than 15% since the peak. SG&A expenses that were reduced 44% compared to last year and are at 14.1% of revenue. That 100 basis point improvement is a result of continued focus on consolidating divisions and we have now reduced our headcount by about two-thirds, since our peak and we are down from approximately 14.100 associates to this week approximately 4.700 associates. There was approximately $8 million of nonrecurring severance and lease termination costs during the quarter. Due to the company's termination of its right to purchase certain land source assets, the company this quarter recognized deferred profit of $101 million and that is net of $32 million of deposits we had on our books that we have written off. This is shown up on two line items in our financial statement. There is $133 million that is a gain on the recap and $32 million of losses relating to those deposits that are in management fee and other. New orders were down 46% during the quarter compared to the prior year. The number of homes in backlog declined 60% year-over-year. And as mentioned the cancellation rate was 32% during the quarter. That compares to 33% in the prior year's quarter and 27% in the third quarter. Our financial services segment had a loss of $5 million during the quarter. That compares with a loss of $19 million in the prior year. There were nonrecurring lease and severance costs of about $3 million during the quarter. Our mortgage pretax increased to a profit of approximately $6 million during the quarter from a loss of $8 million in the prior year. And our capture rate improved from 78% in the third quarter of this year to 86% in the current quarter. Our title operations had an $8 million loss. This compares with the prior year loss of $12 million. Although, Lennar has significant liquidity to meet its future obligations, we will continue to have our top priority on the balance sheet; we'll continue to focus on generating positive cash flow by concentrating on the areas we can control, which are significantly reducing land purchases, carefully managing our inventory levels, maintaining a high backlog conversion ratio, and generating construction efficiencies and continuing to right size our overhead levels. With that I will turn it over to David to talk about our impairment update.
David Collins: Thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. I am going to discuss our impairment process as well as the valuation allowance we recorded against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter. As is tradition during our conference calls, we are once again providing an update of our impairment process to provide further clarity. In this morning's release we outlined our fourth quarter valuation adjustments and write-offs of $221 million, which includes $31.8 million of land source write-offs. We continue to remain actively engaged in our rigorous process of division-by-division asset reviews to ensure that our assets are properly stated. We started this impairment process about three years ago, and were diligent, early on, in reviewing our asset base and recording impairments. We believe that most of the heavy lifting regarding impairments is behind us and that we are at the tail end of the impairment cycle. Impairments in 2008 were $598 million, which was an 81% decrease from our impairments of $3.2 billion in 2007. Let me quickly summarize our fourth quarter impairments. First, the homebuilding side of our business. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to land that we intend to build homes on, and recorded a valuation adjustment of $63 million. The segment detail for all impairments I will be discussing is in this morning's release. Secondly. Land that we sold or intend to sell to third parties. Consistent with our strategy of converting inventory into cash we identified land that we sold during the fourth quarter or intend to sell subsequent to the fourth quarter. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to that land and recorded a valuation adjustment of $17 million. The next category related to land, is option deposits from pre-acquisition costs. We continued to evaluate reevaluate and renegotiate deposits on land under option, as markets remain challenged. For those option contracts, where we were not able to adjust or readjust the terms to a level that would lead to an acceptable return based on current market conditions, we made the decision to walk away from the contract as we have done in past quarters. As a result, we wrote off $63 million of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs, which represented approximately 2700 homesites. As we do with all of our assets we continue to evaluate and reevaluate our investments in joint ventures. In our review, we focused on the recoverability of our investment, relative to the market conditions that exist today. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to the assets in our joint ventures, including the evaluation of discounted future cash flows. Additionally, we applied the standards of APB 18 to our investment balance related to those ventures. In the fourth quarter we recorded a valuation adjustment of $59 million. In addition, we also recorded $19 million of write-offs of notes receivable. In addition to the impairments I just discussed, in the fourth quarter of 2008 we recorded a non-cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $730.8 million. Due to our operational results for the fourth quarter, we have now incurred cumulative losses over the evaluation period we established in accordance with FAS 109, the accounting for income taxes. Accordingly, after evaluating all of the available evidence including our cumulative losses in our evaluation period, we determined that a valuation allowance was required. In future quarters, a portion of the valuation allowance we just established could be reversed, if we generate profits going forward. So after that overview, we would like to open it up for questions.
Scott Shipley: Operator, please open it for questions.
Operator: Certainly, and now we will being our formal question and answer session. (Operator Instructions).Our first question is coming from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Hi. Thanks good morning everyone. The first question is on your pricing strategy, pertinent to your own company, you have not taken as much impairment charges, and we just came off Hovnanian yesterday with a pretty substantial charge and other companies, I think, continue to take much larger charges. One of the things that appears could be contributing is still trying to hold price. Your order [ASP] was up a little bit sequentially. And I was wondering if you could walk through your pricing strategy, and if that is in fact the case, given that in prior remarks you have said that pricing continues to deteriorate and the fact that your backlog is down over 60%, is that pricing approach going to change at all in the coming months?
Stuart Miller: I think our quarterly ASP is down, Mike. What numbers are, you looking at?
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: We are backing into the average order price, not the closing ASP.
Bruce Gross: Okay. Given the small level of our backlog at the end of the quarter Mike, that might be a little deceiving. We have seen reductions in average sales price in pretty much all of our markets across the country. And I would not expect that you are going to see average sales prices increasing.
Stuart Miller: Yes. I think that our pricing policy continues to be the same, Mike where, we continue to price to market conditions. And I think that we are certainly balancing holding sales prices as much as possible to be commercially feasible and to be in the market. But we are clearly bringing down our prices as the market deteriorates.
Bruce Gross: And one thing I would add Mike, as David alluded to in his comments is, we were pricing to market at the start of the downturn and as a result we were ahead of the curve, relating to impairments and valuation adjustments. And last year if you look at our impairments, they were ahead of most of the peers. We had a combined number of almost $3.2 billion of impairments and valuation adjustments last year. This year they were down to $597 million and I think it shows that we were early in the impairment process by dealing with things, pricing the market early than maybe some of the others have.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Okay. I appreciate that. Second question and then I will move on as you requested. Regarding, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks is sort of an independent, raising independent capital to take advantage and continuing to kind of restructure your company, that you would have more of a homebuilding focused operation and the other part more of a land capital intensive operation. And you specifically mentioned LNR is something that you may have kind of worked through in the company in the early to mid 90s. At the same time during that period in the early to mid 90s, a lot of investors were challenged by that more heavy land intensive part of the business. And I believe if my memory serves there was somewhat of a valuation discount in your stock and eventually that was one of the reasons you decided to spin it out separately. What are you thinking currently in terms of this second revisiting of this strategy? I mean are you going to keep it in-house and build it up and eventually spin it out or how do you see this coming about this time around?
Stuart Miller: Well I think that as we have gone through different timeframes we have learned and I think that as we built up a program inside the company in the late 80s, early 90s, we found that it was capital intensive. We think it is more efficient to raise capital outside the company and to build more of a segregated program that is almost, that has most of its capital coming from outside sources. So, it will not be the same program that we embarked on, as we built LNR. But it will have a lot of the same opportunities afforded for the company as we grow forward.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: And would you think it would be in some type of JV structure then?
Stuart Miller: It will be more of a fund structure. And I think that we, relative to that piece of the business I wanted to highlight structurally where we are going that we are segregating as a company, the homebuilding focus and the asset management focus on a go forward basis. But we really cannot give a lot more detail than that right now.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Stuart Miller: Hey, David.
David Goldberg - UBS: Hi. How are you doing? First question is given where the backlog is today at depressed levels, as you think about free cash flow and generating free cash flow with the overhead and with the infrastructure you have in place now. Is it going to be possible to generate free cash flow at these levels as you look forward in fiscal '09 kind of ex the tax refunds?
Bruce Gross: Yes, David, absolutely it is possible and our focus is very much intensely focused on items we control. And if you look at our land purchases in this quarter, they were $64 million, which is down very significantly and that is the biggest cash outlay that we have as a company. And we continue to bring down overhead costs, as well as construction costs as well. So it is absolutely our focus, and it is absolutely possible again.
David Goldberg - UBS: The follow up question I guess is for Stuart and goes to this idea of raising or having a land fund that's going to where the, it's not the assets, the people who are going be spun out of the company. And I guess the question is really about what are you seeing as you go out to investors in terms of trying to raise money to do distressed investing, to do land investing to spin this out? Have you found a change in the appetite or maybe different investors in over the last three months, given what is gone on in the market? And also what kind of return would those investors be looking for given what the risk profile of distressed land investing looks like now?
Stuart Miller: Well, David, I am a little bit limited on what I am allowed to talk about in that regard. But there is no question that the landscape is shifting on a daily basis, relative to the investment world. Realistically, pools of capital are still trying to figure out if they still have capital and what allocations that they will be able to make. The appetite for investment is clearly not what it used to be, that is an understatement. But as we have gone out to the market, I think there is a general recognition that there is a very significant dislocation in the marketplace. People recognize that dislocation breeds opportunity. And really opportunity is best realized by people who have the managerial machine to be able to match up with capital. It is not really financial capital that just does financial underwriting, that thrives in the midst of dislocated assets. It is that operating machine that is most critical and I think that is what we have put together. So while capital is much more selective today and I think there has been general receptivity and we will just have to see where it ends up. The primary focus of my comments today were to highlight that while it is in our DNA to be operational, relative to distress and recovery, it is not our intention to focus the company's capital resources in the direction of capital outflows to working through distress. Instead, our primary focus within the company and with the company assets is going to be purely on the manufacturing machine, with very limited commitments to land assets because we simply will not have to. Over the next years developed home sites will be available for pure production. And our natural propensity and the incubated management team that we have been working with is going to be focused on independent segregated capital in more of a funded structure to be looking at distress very separately.
David Goldberg - UBS: Great. Thank you for the thorough answer. I appreciate it.
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Ivy Zelman, Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Good morning, everybody. The JV success that you have had in reducing the recourse debt down to 116, if you can answer, the first question would relate to understanding the JV partner's composition. Is it going to be hopefully that the rate of change on unwinding future JVs will be at the same pace or is it going to be more challenging now because some of these are stickier and just a idea if they're builder partners, the financial partners, any idea of that composition and your expectations and goals as you unwind and we look forward to continued improvement? And then the second question would be related to your off-balance sheet debt. Bruce, you gave us the numbers. There are 27 joint ventures with non-recourse debt. And wondering what is the total non-recourse debt today and how much of the total debt that is off-balance sheet is non-recourse with completion guarantees associated with it and letters of credit? So, kind of an update of the off-balance sheet debt on top of the $2.544 billion you have on balance sheet please?
Stuart Miller: Ivy, that was like six questions.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Well I had to get it all in.
Stuart Miller: And you are probably going to want to follow up too.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: No, I am done.
Stuart Miller: What was the debt number there?
Bruce Gross: We are just looking up the non-recourse debt number.
Stuart Miller: Okay. I forgot. What was the first question, Ivy?
Bruce Gross: First question was the partners.
Stuart Miller: Okay. So, first of all, clearly, we are going to get to a point where the number of ventures that we actually dismantle starts to go down. We think that for the time being we are still going to be unwinding a number of ventures over the next few quarters. And a lot of that activity is in the works. But one thing I want to highlight is that, some of the ventures that we have in place are very constructive very positive ventures that will continue to operate productively. And so I don't anticipate -- I think there's a core number of ventures -- that we will continue to have as we go forward just because they're working well, they're working as expected and there's no reason to dismantle them. So, we will get down to that core. But until we do you can expect to see as we go forward, a continued reduction in the number of ventures and that will take place over the next few quarters.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Can you talk about the composition of those JVs again if they are builder partners or financial partners?
Stuart Miller: I think there is a variety. It is a different composition. I guess, it is primarily, it is more oriented towards financial partners. A number of the builder partnerships have already been unwound.
Bruce Gross: Yes, a lot of those have been unwound where we have split home sites. There are still some remaining and we are still focused on bringing that number down each of the next several quarters. So, I think you are still going to see progress as we have been seeing in reducing the number of JVs. The non-recourse number that you were asking about Ivy, it is about $3.2 billion. We do not have the chart completed yet that you will see in the 10-K that we expect to file hopefully by the middle of January. And with completion guarantees that number is now down to approximately $800 million.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: That will be $800 million of the $3.2 billion?
Bruce Gross: That is correct. And again, we have not had to make any payments under completion guarantees, as people have been concerned about since the start of the downturn.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: And lastly Bruce, just on letters of credit, is there incremental letters of credit on top of the $3.2 billion?
Bruce Gross: The total financial letters of credit in the company were further reduced to $278 million during the quarter and some of those relate to letters of credit that are deposits with some of the joint ventures but that number continues to come down.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Is that incorporated in the $3.2 billion or separate on top of it?
Bruce Gross: No that is separate. But the $278 million are the total number of financial letters of credit in the company. It includes letters of credit just to operate a business our size for things like insurance and other things. So that letter of credit amount relating to any of the joint ventures has come down very considerably.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: I will get back in the queue. Thanks.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt of Wachovia.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Hey guys, how are you?
Bruce Gross: Hi Carl.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Bruce I have a question just on, I guess what I call cash margin. So if we just forget GAAP margin for a second, gross margin, and just look at the cash invested in land before impairments and then direct construction costs. Are you getting more cash out of the individual deliveries you had this quarter than you actually put in? So in other words have we flipped from partial return of cash to return on cash?
Bruce Gross: That's correct; so if you look at our average land basis in a home, let's say it is somewhere between $50 million and $60 million a home site, we're generating positive gross margin, so we're getting back the cash invested in the land on top of any margin on that home as well.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Again, not looking at an impaired basis but on a real cash basis; so look at what you actually paid in cash in the first place, ignore the impairment, are you getting that total cash pool back?
Stuart Miller: Well, we have not done that calculation so I cannot answer that question.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: What is your guess?
Stuart Miller: I had rather not guess. Can you go through that again?
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: I am just….
Bruce Gross: To the extent that we have taken further impairments, if we were to add all the impairments that have been taken in the past, are we still positive from a cash margin standpoint.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Its okay, we can go through it later. I am just trying to figure out when we go from -- it is actually cash register accounting, we have a positive margin as opposed to GAAP accounting. But that is okay, I have one other…
Stuart Miller: What you are really asking Carl is conceptually if we were to buy a new homesite.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Right.
Stuart Miller: And we were to buy that homesite and build a home, are we bringing in more cash than we laid out for that home?
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Right.
Stuart Miller: And you would include an allocation of SG&A for that right?
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Well, I am not in this particular example, but if you wanted to sure, yes. I mean I was asking about just cost.
Stuart Miller: Clearly excess SG&A the answer is clearly yes, but SG&A is the wild card, which would fluctuate relative to volume. But if you include SG&A, right now the answer would be yes.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Okay.
Bruce Gross:  And I think also as you look at that the impairments taken previously, the land basis we have today is sustainable. So we believe that will continue on any land that we buy that will generate cash margin going forward, even under current existing option agreements or any additional take downs we would have from joint ventures.
Stuart Miller: The homesite that we are taking today is a homesite that is being put into production and delivered and we are only taking it down or putting it into production, if it is producing positive cash.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Okay. I got you. The second last question Stuart is more theoretical. But given that as the company splits, investors in the equity of the company are not going to be I guess buying the same land machine that they bought previously. They are going to be buying a company that is basically a manufacturer. What assurances can you give them now that you are going to be a low cost manufacturer or a great manufacturer? What's going to make you a better than a traditional builder, who's literally buying finished lots and producing rapidly or quickly, so their margin basis is all in the box? What is going to make you better?
Stuart Miller: Well, I do not know how to answer that question right now. I think that the markets in enough turmoil that the way we all evolve as we come out of this market is open to some questions. But I think that from the standpoint of the way that we have been organized in the past, to us the focus is and has been on having a very limited number of floor plans and a focus program on making sure that those floor plans are efficient and tuned into local market expectations and desires. I think that is what we have done in the past. By keeping the number of floor plans or models available small, we continue to be able to benefit from volume purchasing. It does not happen to be the case right now. Right now, construction costs are just being driven down by the sheer magnitude of the drop in volumes overall. But I think that as we reemerge, we will continue to keep and maintain a very simplistic approach to the way that we operate our business, which will enable us to keep low the number of SKUs that we employ and that in turn, will keep our production costs very low. So, I think that as we go forward, expect to see that we are going to be very focused manufacturing machine, with a very simplistic footprint market-by-market and that is going to drive our construction costs to be a low cost provider construction costs.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Okay. I appreciate that so much. Thanks so much, guys.
Stuart Miller: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. Stuart, first question I wanted to ask was in your remarks at the beginning you were talking about the need for demand stimulus, rate reductions, perhaps, even some kind of a tax incentive or tax credit. I was just wondering rate have come down quite a bit just on their own more recently or from the fed actions that you mentioned. So, have you seen a response to that from buyers either in traffic or conversion of that traffic to orders?
Stuart Miller: No and I think that was kind of the underlying point. Yes, we have started to see the beginning. But, unfortunately, the momentum is still stalled in the negative direction it is going to take a lot more. And I think that people are seeing and becoming aware of this. I mean just recently you have seen mortgage rates start to decline to the sub 5% range. I guess we will all have to wait and see if that has more of an impact. But we have tested in the field four and half, four and three quarter kind of rate level, it is really not enough to get people off the fence right now. And I think that, I do not know if it is going to be in a first pass or if it is going to come a little bit later. But I think that, everyone is going to recognize that in order to stabilize housing prices, which is critical to the financial institutions and to consumption as well, we are going to have to really drag buyers back into the marketplace with some real meaningful incentives. It is my sense, right now.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Got it, that is very helpful. And I understand it is pretty early in the process. My second question, I wanted to ask about the lots that are coming on to your balance sheet, your lot count is up a few thousand over the last couple of quarters. I wanted to get a sense of these lots that are coming on to your balance sheet from two perspectives, the first being from a marked perspective or impairment perspective. You folks were certainly ahead of the curve, in terms of recognizing conditions and marking your assets appropriately. So these assets coming on to your balance sheet might not be as ahead of the curve in terms of their marks. And second from the perspective of their state of development what stage of development are these lots that are coming on to your balance sheet?
Bruce Gross: And Nishu, let me just comment that actually our homesites that are owned are down slightly from the third quarter. The third quarter they were 76,000 and now we are down a little over 1,000 homesites this quarter. So it has come down a bit and as we look to where we were at the end of last year, that is probably what you are referring to, they are up a little bit. And the reason why they're up a little bit over last year is, we have taken advantage of strategic purchases over the last year from joint ventures that we are unwinding, where we like the land and we were getting the homesites at a very attractive price or the ability to buy homesites under an option program, where there was some downside protection if the ultimate home price was to go down in value. So the addition was for homesites that we believe will generate strong returns, even given the current market conditions.
Stuart Miller: I think that by and large any homesites that are coming on our books now are what I would call pre-impaired we are buying them at reduced pricing. They would be what you would think of as similarly situated to the land that is on our books currently. The hit is generally taken before any of these properties are actually brought on the books by us. And relative to a joint venture position, a joint venture partner might have walked away from their equity, might have had to pay down part of the debt, any number of things might have happened. In terms of the development condition of most of these homesites, while there are different homesites that are in different stages of development, by and large, I would say most of them are finished and developed.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: I guess I should have made my assumption clear; I am assuming that a lot of the lot increases is because of the joint ventures, either a take down agreement or a consolidation. Is that generally the right assumption?
Stuart Miller: Well, we also have option contracts that we continue to perform under that are not relative to joint ventures where we might be bringing on homesites. But in those instances, as with our joint ventures, the homesites that we are bringing on have all been renegotiated prices. Where the price of the homesite simply does not work in the current environment, we have walked away from those deposits. And we did an awful lot of that last year and in the beginning of this year. So, we have either renegotiated the price at which we are purchasing, or we have walked away from the option contract, or the joint venture has had to resolve itself.
Bruce Gross: And just to clarify an issue, there are no obligations to take down any homesites from joint ventures - zero specific performance with any of our joint ventures.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Got it. Okay, I will get back in the queue. Thanks a lot.
Bruce Gross: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Susan Berliner, JPMorgan.
Chris Bailey - JPMorgan: Hey, this is Chris Bailey in for Sue. Just a quick question, wanted to verify that the evaluation allowance charge the 730, is that added back to your tangible net worth?
Bruce Gross: If you look at our recent credit facility amendment what we did is we lowered our minimum tangible net worth where there is a minimum tangible net worth now of $1.3 billion. So if you are looking at the tangible net worth covenant after you factor in the deferred tax asset valuation-reserve there is ample room with respect to that covenant which I think is where your question was directed.
Chris Bailey - JPMorgan: Yes. I guess what I am getting at is I belief tangible net worth is a component of the leverage ratio covenant. So that is what I was looking at or if I can just get the leverage ratio at the quarter end I can back into it.
Bruce Gross: Yes the leverage ratio covenant has a maximum actually 55% is the new leverage ratio as part of our covenant and there is ample room with respect to that covenant as well even with deferred tax asset reserves taken.
Chris Bailey - JPMorgan: Okay. But so then I guess I am understanding that the denominator part of the leverage ratio includes tangible net worth. I am just trying to understand if the tangible net worth, back to I guess the original question, if I understand the minimum tangible net worth that you have to have the greater of the calculation of $1.33 billion, I guess what I am asking is, is that FAS 109, the discharge actually reduces tangible net worth or for the credit agreement or for the leverage ratio covenant?
Bruce Gross: That is correct. So the adjusted consolidated tangible net worth is the equity number that is used in the calculation for the leverage ratio.
Chris Bailey - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Bruce Gross: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Josh Levin of Citi.
Josh Levin - Citigroup: Hey, good afternoon everybody.
Stuart Miller: Hi.
Josh Levin - Citigroup: Stuart, you mentioned your enthusiasm for the new administration and we have all been reading in the newspapers the details about what will likely be a I guess a large stimulus package. Based on your discussions with folks in Washington and Chicago, when do you think we might get some clarity on the new administration's policy towards the housing market?
Stuart Miller: Oh boy, everybody is trying to figure that out.
Josh Levin - Citigroup: Yes, but you are connected; right?
Stuart Miller: Well, you know, I do not know that I am connected. I do not know which of the homebuilders are connected. We are all trying. I think that is and appropriately so, a black box right now. I think that the administration has clearly drawn a wall around itself and is not giving those answers because I think that the administration is balancing a lot of thoughts and requests, and I think doing so in a very closed environment. And I think that in time, they will come out with their program. So I do not think there is an answer to that question right now and I suspect that even within those walls the decisions are not yet mapped out, as competing interests are being put down on paper and given a priority. So, I think we are going to have to wait and see.
Josh Levin - Citigroup: Okay. Fair enough. Last question, we know that down payment assistance programs went away in October. How much did you use them during the last quarter and then to what extent has Lennar made use of other perhaps not as well known buyer assistance programs, like the USDA guaranteed loan program?
Stuart Miller: We are looking for those numbers. Hold on a second.
Bruce Gross: Yeah, the down payment assistance program came down this quarter. 25% of our deliveries used the down payment assistance program and that is a quarterly number but after the end of October, there was no down payment assistance program. So with our November deliveries there were no more down payment assistance opportunities with respect to the mortgages.
Stuart Miller: There are some more local ones that some of our divisions are using but we do not have a compilation of that number.
Josh Levin - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.
Stuart Miller: Okay.
Operator: Our next question is from Stephen East, Pali Capital.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Good day, everybody.
Stuart Miller: Hello, Steve.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: You all have done a good job of generating some cash and reducing your exposure on joint ventures and I understand what your maturities are coming for the next few years on balance sheet. If we look at '09 and '10 for the JVs, what type of maturity levels do you have coming due on those?
Bruce Gross: I am assuming Steve, your question is relating to JVs where we have recourse guarantees.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Exactly.
Bruce Gross: So, if you look at the $520 million, I think, the first comment is that if there is a maturity with those loans it does not mean there is any obligation on the part of the company. I just want to highlight there is approximately, I think it is $1.3 billion of equity with respect to those joint ventures where there's $520 million of recourse guarantees. Now, as you talk about maturities; some of the joint ventures that have backlog in place and those loans will be paid off based on the closing of backlog. But if you looked at the pure maturity it spreads out for the most part, over the next two to three years all of those JVs will have maturities. But we expect any cash coming from the company would certainly not be very significant relative to our balance sheet.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. So if I looked at that $520 million is it safe to say, probably not even half of that would need cash coming from you all versus the backlog generation?
Bruce Gross: I would certainly believe it would be below half.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: And then, if we could turn Stuart back to the talking about the company structure and I appreciate all the detail you have given us. Would this fund only be looking at land and moving forward or do you envision it taking it off of your current balance sheet, away from your operations now. And you would look much more like just a manufacturer of homes or would you burn through that?
Stuart Miller: No I think and that is a good question, Stephen. I think that we are going to burn through the legacy land that we own. I think it makes it very complicated to try to sell to a new fund. So, the way that we are structuring is that the assets that we own within the company will be self liquidating.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. Which leads me just to the next part of it, from a human resources perspective, would that just be, I am assuming overtime you would probably move those people over into this fund, but that's not, if I'm looking at '09 and your SG&A costs and some of that, that may not be a big savings that you would find this in '09?
Stuart Miller: No, that is correct. I do not think that there will be a big savings in '09. There will be some that move over, but I do not think it will have a meaningful impact.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. And just one last question, just as you looked at your sequential trends, your demand trends in the quarter. How would you characterize those from a monthly basis?
Stuart Miller: Our sequential trends, you mean month-by-month?
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Correct.
Stuart Miller: The quarter clearly trended towards deterioration. If you remember, when we talked in the third quarter, let's see, that June and July were really bad months, August saw a tick up from the DPA assistance, the DPA programs going away, September continued a little bit of that trend, but as we moved into October/November, the market got materially worse. And I think that the trend seems to be moving in that direction.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. Thanks a lot. Nice quarter.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Timothy Jones, Wasserman & Associates.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: Good morning.
Stuart Miller: Hi, Tim.
Bruce Gross: Good morning.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: I had two questions, one, on the $520 million non-recourse obligations. Does that include all the debt and any completion guarantees, and if it is, can you break it out how it goes?
Bruce Gross: The $500 million, which are the recourse, obligations relating to unconsolidated JVs that is just the debt guarantee portion, but...
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: How much more is the completion guarantees?
Bruce Gross: It is very minimal.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: Minimal.
Bruce Gross: Yes, it is very small number.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: Okay, that is first one. The second one, I spent two decades explaining LNR to people to my (chagrin). I mean, it is just unbelievable I do not even want to go through it. You know, how happy I was when you got rid of it. But what you are talking about is going back and having joint ventures on your future land buy, and you are not the only one, with financial partners and yet you say it is not going to be a JV. And you are going to have management fees and so forth. This sounds awfully much like a son of LNR.
Stuart Miller: Well, I hope that I highlighted it as such. It is just that we are going to do it in a different way.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: I did not quite get the different way.
Stuart Miller: Okay, well bear with me. You are right, it did cause some confusion. But one of the things that we might want to remember is LNR generated a lot of profit for the company and a lot of value creation for the shareholders. So it is that component of it that I would like to do all over again. But at the same and on the residential side by the way.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: Right, commercial…
Stuart Miller: But the difference in structure is that we are not going to do a series of ventures in the company here. And really if you look backwards Tim that is what we have got is a series of ventures. This is a fund where all of those activities will happen within that fund structure and it will be isolated with a discrete investment from the company and that is the company's involvement investment in its entirety. The management will be self contained and it will grow and produce more of a passive profitability for the company. And that is about as far as I can go right now.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: Just what we want to add on to that, will you have any commercial, obviously you are talking about a lot less commercial activity than you had in LNR. But with the land you buy, you obviously generate some commercial properties off of these purchases.
Stuart Miller: Yes, but we do that anyway even inside Lennar. The bottom-line is right now if we look ahead to the next quarter, two quarters, three quarters, I think that the commercial opportunity anyway is not going to be ripening for some time to come. The residential dislocation is going to mature first. And so, you can expect that this program will have virtually no commercial components whatsoever.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: But it will own all the JVs then?
Stuart Miller: Well, it will own its own JVs. We do not anticipate moving anything from the existing corporate books into this fund.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman & Associates: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay. You bet.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Jim Wilson, JMP Securities.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: I was wondering rather than digging into the debt side and obligations of the JVs. Could you give a little update that you can on how your thoughts on future development are proceeding for some of your major JVs such as like, Hunters Candlestick Point or even El Torro? And then the second one would be, obviously, I suppose the former JV, but what's happening with LandSource, are you in a position I would assume to try to get back in and pick up some of the assets or if you can give any update on what's going on there, that would be great also?
Stuart Miller: Jim, I would love to give better color on some of these things. But in all of these things, we are really constrained in how much talking we can do. We have partners, we have confidentialities. In LandSource, we clearly have litigation. And so, we really cannot give much of an update and speak about specific partnerships. But, these programs are a lot like the broader market. Where there is entitlement activity, we continue to proceed on entitlement activity. Where there is impairment, we continue to look at impairment for what it is. And so expect that the land in these JVs is being dealt with in much the same way that the land within the primary company is being dealt with.
Jim Wilson - JMP Securities: Okay. All right, thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Megan McGrath, Barclays Capital.
Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to get back to backlog really quickly. As you stated, your backlog was down fairly significantly, but you were able in the past couple of quarters to convert a pretty high level of that backlog to closing. So, given that your spec count was up, do you expect to be able to maintain that pretty high level of backlog conversion or what is the best way for us to think about that?
Bruce Gross: I think you can expect Megan that, we will have a very high backlog conversion ratio again in the first quarter. We certainly expect that the number of completed unsold homes will come down significantly in the first quarter. And that will be very helpful in generating very high backlog conversion.
Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital: Okay. Great, that is helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the balance sheet and the JVs and what happened with your debt. I guess I am a little confused. If you can help break it down. Your non-recourse went down by about $109 million; your corporate debt went up by a little over $200 million. If you can walk us through the moving parts, I think you said some of the new corporate debt was non-recourse. So, does that mean that some of the $3.2 billion could come on to your books later? If you can maybe walk us through exactly what happened that would be helpful?
Bruce Gross: Sure. There were four joint ventures that consolidated this quarter. The debt was primarily non-recourse. That was a result as we evaluate the contributions from the partners there was a greater weighting of contributions or financial responsibilities from the Lennar side. As a result they consolidated for accounting purposes. It did not change the nature of the non-recourse debt however. I do not expect that this will continue going forward. There were some specific joint ventures that had been closed in this quarter. They did move over the line and were required to be consolidated. So as a result, $200 million was required to be consolidated on our books. That increased Lennar's debt balance. And as you look at the recourse indebtedness that came down that relating to JVs that is only one component of it. When you look at the non-recourse debt, non-recourse debt had come down as well. And I would be happy to provide some more color. We have not completed the typical schedule that will go in the 10-K breaking this out but I would be happy to walk through that mechanic with you after the call and help you reconcile that.
Megan McGrath - Barclays Capital: That will be great. Thanks very much.
Bruce Gross: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Buck Horne, Raymond James
Buck Horne - Raymond James: Good afternoon. Appreciate the extra detail on the inventory balances at year end as well. I was wondering if you can estimate how much of the $2.1 billion work-in-progress is land without any vertical construction on it?
Bruce Gross: Of that number Buck, we have been running finished homesites in that category, running about $800 million.
Buck Horne - Raymond James: Perfect. And one follow up, do you have any estimates of maybe over just the next six months or so what you project land acquisition and development costs may be and what your carrying costs on just the land portfolio now is in terms of soft costs?
Bruce Gross: The soft costs in terms of the land that we own, our land balance has come down considerably year-over-year. So the property taxes are pretty minimal on the land that we have on our balance sheet. So, I do not have an exact number calculated, but the number is not very significant.
Buck Horne - Raymond James: Okay. Any estimate on looking at land CapEx spend?
Bruce Gross: We are not spending a lot of money on land development at all. And as Stuart mentioned, our focus on having a land light homebuilding manufacturing model, we are very focused on only buying finished homesites. So with a good portion of the land that we have, as either finished homesites or a significant development underway, we are looking at significant reductions in any of the land development spend. And we already have seen that as this year has progressed.
Buck Horne - Raymond James: All right. Thanks very much.
Bruce Gross: Welcome.
Stuart Miller: Hello. Hello.
Bruce Gross: Operator, are there any other questions?
Operator: Yes, we do have a question coming from Ken Zener of Macquarie.
Stuart Miller: And let us go ahead and make this the last question, if that is all right.
Ken Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Appreciate it, Stuart.
Stuart Miller: Sure.
Ken Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Given you guys had strong margins, and I am trying to understand the mix of your owned lots because you guys have obviously been taking some down. How much of the owned lots would you say are finished?
Bruce Gross: The exact homesite count we do not have. But we can talk about it in terms of dollars.
Ken Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: That would be fine, because it seems like a lot of this stuff has come through the joint ventures, because you sell homes and obviously lot counts have been stable. So it is a good thing, just trying to see how much of the investment spend has been done on those lots.
Bruce Gross: Okay. So if you look at our inventory components broken out, maybe it is helpful to say that homes under construction, so obviously those are finished, and that includes any vertical sticks and bricks, there is $1.2 billion in that category, there is under $1.5 billion of land underdevelopment and there is slightly higher than $800 million of finished homesites. And then the rest of the inventory category is option deposits and other miscellaneous. So hopefully that helps to break out the numbers from a dollar standpoint.
Ken Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: That does. And I wonder if you could talk because you guys obviously with your units under construction being a high multiple of your backlog. What is the type of and your excellent gross margin this quarter? Can you talk about the spreads you are seeing between the units you are delivering out of backlog relative to the spec units? Because some builders have talked about spreads existing there, but with your high corporate gross margin it does not appear that that is a significant factor for you.
Bruce Gross: Yes. We do not have an exact breakout of those spreads, but our focus has been to keep the inventory very low. So we are managing to a low inventory level that is spec and we are aggressively moving through those each quarter. And most of what we have been successful with is using some of the low mortgage rates to help move through some of the specs that exist and that has been very successful for us.
Ken Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Right. But I mean I guess there is a spread that exists to the extent that when you are delivering over 100% of backlog, the reason is because of the high units under construction. But I mean are they kind of blend there to the extent there's a spread you're actually pulling in above 20 it would seem, on the units out of backlog, which people understand to be a more stable margin.
Bruce Gross: Well in some of our markets we brought down our cycle time, in a market like Texas typically has a pretty short construction cycle as well. So there is a little bit of a mix balance there.
Ken Zener - Macquarie Research Equities: Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: You are very welcome. And that will be it for today. Any of you that need to circle back and ask questions, we are as always available and look forward to giving you further update as we come around to the first quarter. Hopefully there will be greater clarity as to where we go governmentally, when we come back to our first quarter results. Thank you again for joining us.
Operator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your speaker for today’s conference, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Mr. Miller; you may begin. 
Stuart Miller: Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2008 update. I am joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer and David Collins, our Controller.  Bruce will provide additional detail on our numbers; David will give you an update on our asset review and impairments, a report have given for over two years now and Diane will be available to participate in our question-and-answer period.  Just as a housekeeping item before I start I would like to request as always, in our question-and-answer period that will follow our opening remarks that you please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. Of course we welcome you to rejoin the queue if you have additional questions and we will attempt to answer as many questions as possible.  Now in the context of what has been perhaps once of the most difficult quarters in homebuilding history, Lennar’s management team and associates have put forth an extremely productive quarter. We have continued to focus on the basics of rebuilding our operating business while we’ve also continued to carefully manage our asset base and work diligently to rework and reposition our joint ventures. We feel that we’re making credible progress towards profitability in the most difficult of times. In the third quarter the housing market continued to deteriorate though at an accelerated rate. June and July were truly dismal sales months and in August we saw what I would call a phantom uptick, which derived primarily from the pending elimination of the down payment assistance program on October 1st of this year which was part of the so-called stimulus package passed in July. I’m asked regularly as to whether or not we’re at the bottom and I feel overall that we’re not there yet. In this market we recognize that some things are just out of our control and we’re simply not going to be able to alter those elements. The items that we can control however, we’ve been all over them in each of our divisions. Just over two weeks ago, our senior management team visited with each of our divisions as we did our operations review. A review of our reported numbers showed the meaningful progress that we found in each of our divisions. We’re rebuilding our gross margin which showed improvement of some 400 basis points year-over-year before valuation adjustments to 18%. Our operating margin before valuation adjustments has improved some 230 basis points to 2.3% producing a diminished loss from operations for the quarter of just under $7 million. While a portion of this improvement no doubt derives from impairments previously taken and Bruce will cover that later, an increasing proportion stems from a focused re-engineering of our product, materially reduced construction costs and a determined attention to right-sizing our SG&A which stands at a still-disappointing 15.7% of lower then expected revenues. Nevertheless, our SG&A is down some $148 million or 49% year-over-year and we expect continued meaningful improvement in SG&A in the fourth quarter in both dollars and percentage.  We’re starting to see a quarterly progression of positive trends in this distressed market environment which positions the company well for rebound in the future. A few basic highlights show that gross margin has improved from 15.9% in the second quarter to 18% this quarter.  Operating margin has improved from 0.5% in the second quarter to 2.3% this quarter and pre-tax loss before valuation adjustments has declined from almost $36 million in the second quarter to just under $7 million this quarter.  Impairments are also declining though modestly, from approximately $137 million in the second quarter to approximately $132 million in the third. Generally speaking there are not yet signs of stabilization in the field, demand patterns are inconsistent and erratic, and we have found that there’s an increasing flow of foreclosures that are maintaining downward pressure on prices and appraisals.  In most markets it’s apparent that the flow of foreclosed homes is expanding rather then subsiding. There is a silver lining in all of this though it is currently of limited consequence. The positive news from the field relative to some markets is that inventory of finished new homes is coming down and the number of competing new home communities is declining and the number of builders is also declining.  With market conditions still extremely soft though, our operating progress is meaningful. On the asset management front, we’ve continued to fortify our company by continuing to manage and restate our land assets, while we simultaneously keep our inventory of completed homes very low and reduce the number and composition of our joint ventures. In fact, we have reduced the number of joint ventures from 270 at the peak, to 146 currently and that’s down from 163 last quarter. Of those 146 joint ventures, 67 of them have no debt, 31 have non-recourse debt, and 48 have recourse debt.  Recourse debt to joint ventures is down from a high of $1.8 billion in 2006 now to $630 million which is down some $177 million from last quarter. We have reworked, or are close to a rework on most of our non-performing joint ventures and the trend on joint ventures is positive. And we will not and cannot comment on specific ventures, we have held true to our conviction that we do not support the debt the non-recourse obligations and we are not excusing partners from sharing partnership losses. And while the renegotiation process can be difficult and time consuming, many of our partnerships have presented us with an opportunity to actually enhance our investment position. Our overall land asset is down similarly. Additionally each division brought tremendous focus on inventory homes in the third quarter and reduced completed inventory by almost 50% year-over-year. Great progress has been made on the asset side of our business so management can focus on sales, construction and SG&A and our divisions are in fact focused on the basics of blocking and tackling [and] fewer home building.  On the corporate side we’ve complimented the progress in the field. Our balance sheet remains strong with a substantial cash position of $857 million. While that is down slightly from the second quarter we continue to seize opportunity where distress creates unique value, rather then walk away from opportunity.  We anticipate that we will continue to use available cash to harvest value and opportunity from our joint ventures as they arise. Additionally there is nothing borrowed on our revolver and we have a responsible debt-to-total capital position at 40.5% and net of cash that is just over 30%.  In the wake of the meaningful restatements of assets that we have undergone and the repositioning of many of our venture properties, this is meaningful progress. And while we continued to lose money in the third quarter with a loss per share of $0.56, and a homebuilding operating loss of approximately $92 million, aggregate levels of impairments and losses are more in the nature of clean-up rather then reconciliation to unknown market conditions.  As I have said in prior quarters, we have done the heavy lifting on impairments and we are not situated with stated assets that can and will produce improving margins when the rate of decline in market pricing subsides. We are confident that even with continued degradation of market conditions; our stated asset base will not require significant downward correction.  In conclusion let me say that we’ve made a great deal of progress in a very difficult market. We’ve prepared our company for market conditions as they currently exist and we are not projecting a material improvement for some time to come.  But as I’ve said before, this should not be confused with abject pessimism. In fact, I remain quite optimistic about our business and the housing market in general. Although it is difficult to find reason to be optimistic in these unprecedented turbulent market conditions, I believe this market will rebound. It will have to rebound in order to stimulate the rest of the economy back onto its feet. Whether over the next month or after the election, steps will be taken out of necessity to facilitate home ownerships leadership out of the economic doldrums. We have finally come to a time when consensus is building that falling home prices are not only detrimental to the economy at large, but in order to repair our failing financial system we will have to stop the decline. Sooner or later, Washington will connect the dots that indicate that a floor in home prices will provide the foundation on which we can actually build a future. The current stop-gap measures to aid hard-hit financial companies will be repeatedly frustrated by falling home prices and the securities that back them. Any meaningful solution to the credit crisis will necessitate a simultaneous stabilization of the housing market. The housing stimulus Bill that was passed by Congress in July simply was not enough. In fact, I would argue that the Bill was net net, anti-stimulative.  The $7,500 tax credit which was actually an interest free loan, created very little incentive to families looking to purchase a home and the elimination of the down payment assistance program and the increase in the FHA down payment requirement from 3% to 3.5%, actually took purchasers out of the market when we could least afford it.  The indicators keep coming in and its seems that we are quickly approaching the time where decision makers will reconcile to the reality that positive constructive steps need to be taken to properly support weakened markets and enable them to recover.  If we’re going to get homeownership back on its feet, and stop the fall of home prices, we’re going to need to facilitate the absorption of inventory by encouraging buyers to start purchasing again and we’re going to have to facilitate a mortgage market to be able to lend at multiple price points to those purchasers. This fix continues to be the bright light that I see at the end of homebuilding’s dark tunnel. And while we might argue or suggest that actions are late, it does seem that there is a floor out there where enough negative news which is now confirmed, will result in enough action to bring on sustainable stabilization. The housing market is faced with increased supply from foreclosures and suppressed demand. Home inventories primarily existing homes, are expanding and will have to be absorbed before pressure is relieved from sales volume and pace.  At Lennar we’ve been heads-up throughout the downturn in the housing market and we’ve prepared our company to succeed in current market conditions and to thrive when the market ultimately corrects.  Thank you and I’ll turn it over to Bruce now. 
Bruce Gross : Thank you Stuart and good morning. As Stuart discussed, this is a quarter of significant progress and I’ll be providing some of the financial details supporting that progress. Turning to the operating results for the quarter, we have narrowed our pre-impairment loss to $0.03 per share for the quarter. David will walk us through this quarter’s impairments which as you will see, these impairments are largely behind us at this point.  Revenues from home sales decreased 54% to $996 million driven by a 49% decrease in home deliveries and a 9% decrease in average sales price to $270,000.  The average sales prices net of sales incentives, which averaged $45,900 per home during the quarter and that was flat with the prior year’s number. The average sales price declined regionally as follows: the East was down 7% to $263,000, Central was down 3% to $200,000, the West was down 15% to $376,000, and the Other category was flat at about $300,000. We continued to improve on the positive trend in operating margins. Our gross margin was 18% before impairments and our selling, general and administrative expenses were 15.7% resulting in the 2.3% operating margin Stuart mentioned. The pre-impairment gross margin improved 400 basis points over the prior year and this improvement in gross margin was due to first, a lower land base from the exhaustive asset reviews each quarter, impairing assets to be reflective of today’s market conditions, as well as, more recent land purchases which are reflective of current market conditions. And then second from lower construction costs. We have aggressively reduced the number of floor plans in our markets, rebid our construction plans and we have centralized purchasing to achieve savings on both the local, regional and national scale. Our construction costs per square foot have been reduced by close to 15% from the peak. The operating strategies to achieve these cost savings have taken some time to be implemented and recognized in the numbers and we are now seeing the results in our numbers. The East region experienced the largest improvement in the gross margin during the quarter. Similarly, the operating measures taken relative to right-sizing SG&A have taken some time to be implemented and recognized in the numbers. SG&A expenses were reduced by $148 million or 49% versus last year and as a percentage of revenue was up 170 basis points to 15.7%. During the quarter we expensed approximately $15 million of non-recurring severance and lease termination costs as a result of additional division consolidations. We have made significant progress in reducing SG&A costs however our volume has fallen at a faster pace. As a result of these additional division consolidations, we have now reduced both our divisions and our headcount by approximately two-thirds since our peak in 2006. These measures taken should enable us to see significant reductions in our SG&A percent going forward.  New order were down 42% during the quarter compared to the prior year. The number of homes in backlog declined 44% year-over-year and our cancellation rate declined to 27% for the quarter from 32% in the prior year’s quarter. We have seen significant progress from our financial services operations as well as profits improved from a loss of $5.2 million to a profit of $12.8 million and all of these financial service numbers I’ll be discussing are excluding a $27 million write-off of all the goodwill in our mortgage subsidiary in the current quarter. Mortgage-free tax increased from a loss of $2.3 million to a profit of $14 million. This quarter our mortgage capture rate improved from 72% in the prior year’s quarter to 87% in the current quarter. Almost all of our loans in this quarter were fixed rate loans and the percentage of government loans increased to about two-thirds of our mortgage originations in the current quarter from 25% in the prior year’s quarter. Our title company narrowed their loss to $600,000 for the quarter compared with a $1.3 million loss in the prior year and [title] has made significant progress in right-sizing its operations to today’s market conditions and actually showed a profit in August, which was their first monthly profit since June of last year.  We continued to focus on a strong balance sheet as we aggressively reduced our JV recourse indebtedness while maintaining our strong cash position. We generated EBIT during the quarter before valuation adjustments of $21 million which is an increase from the second quarter and then as Stuart mentioned we had $857 million of homebuilding cash on the balance sheet while we had zero outstandings on our revolving credit facility. As our liquidity position remains strong and our leverage on a net debt to total capital basis actually improved from the third quarter of the prior year down to 30.2% we also had substantial equity with $3.4 billion at the end of the third quarter.  We have made significant progress on the reduction in the number of unconsolidated JVs and a reduction of recourse indebtedness, as Stuart mentioned while we maintained strong liquidity and a strong cash position.  I won’t repeat all the numbers that Stuart mentioned but I will highlight again that the maximum recourse JV indebtedness has come down from approximately $1.8 billion at the end of 2006 to $630 million at the end of this quarter and our net recourse JV exposure has been reduced to $492 million at the end of this quarter. That is net of reimbursement agreements we have with our partners. This quarter’s progress was significant as we are approximately three quarters ahead of schedule with respect to our bank covenant on maximum JV recourse reduction and we have accomplished the reduction again with the minimal change in our cash balance.  The total cash payments relating to re-margining guarantees with JVs having recourse debt during the quarter was only $9 million and there was also significant progress made during the quarter in reducing our financial letters of credit which are down about 60% from the peak which was $728 million at the end of 2006, to $294 million at the end of this quarter. We have continued to carefully manage our inventory levels as they have been reduced by 36% from the prior year’s quarter to $4.1 billion and that excludes consolidated inventory not owned. Finished homes and construction in progress was reduced 29% from $3.2 billion to $2.2 billion year-over-year. Land under development was also reduced 42% from $3.2 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year and from the second quarter of this year inventory increased sequentially about $200 million, but that was all due to strategic purchase of assets from joint ventures as a result of renegotiations with our partners. Inventory purchases declined 60% from last year’s third quarter from $348 million to about $139 million and that was also a sequential decline from our second quarter which had land purchases of $162 million.  We have reduced our unsold completed homes by about 50% from the prior year to 623 at the end of this quarter, which averages just over one per community. We have continued to manage starts to today’s demand levels and as a result, homes under construction have declined over the prior year by 31% from 9,100 to 6,300 in the third quarter. And our home sites owned and controlled have been reduced by 62% since the peak in 2006 from about 346,000 to 130,000 today and that’s comprised of 7,600 owned, 15,000 controlled by options with third party sellers and 39,000 options from joint ventures.  Again we have made significant progress this quarter and we look forward to discussing additional progress when we talk with you again next quarter. And with that I’m going to turn it over to David to discuss an update on impairments.
David Collins : Thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. As is tradition during our conference calls, we are once again providing an update of our impairment process to provide further clarity. In this morning’s release we outlined our third quarter valuation adjustments of $132 million. We continue to remain actively engaged in our rigorous process of division by division asset reviews to ensure that our assets are properly stated. We started this impairment process almost three years ago and were diligent early on in reviewing our asset base and recording impairments. As we have previously disclosed we believe that most of the heavy lifting regarding impairments is behind us and that we are at the tail-end of the impairment cycle.  Let me quickly summarize our third quarter impairments. First the Homebuilding side of our business, we applied the standards of FAS B 144 to land that we intend to build homes on and recorded a valuation adjustment of $32 million. This amount was 56% lower then the homebuilding impairment charge we recorded in the second quarter of 2008. The segment detail is as follows: East segment was $9 million; Central segment was $3 million; West segment was $19 million; and Other was $2 million. The second bucket is land that we sold or intend to sell to third parties. Consistent with our strategy of converting inventory into cash, we identified land that we sold during the third quarter or intend to sell subsequent to the third quarter. We applied the standards the FAS B 144 to that land and recorded a valuation adjustment of $13 million. The segment detail is as follows: East was $11 million; Central was $1 million; and the West was $1 million.  Third, we have the next category which relates to land and adoption deposits and pre-acquisition costs. We continue to evaluate, reevaluate and renegotiate deposits on land under option as markets remain challenged. For those option contracts where we were not able to adjust or readjust the terms to a level that would lead to an acceptable return based on current market conditions, we made the decision to walk away from the contract as we have done in past quarters.  As a result we wrote off $11 million of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs which represented approximately 900 home sites. The segment detail is as follows: East $1 million; Central $2 million; West $6 million; and Other $2 million. As we do with all of our assets we continue to evaluate and reevaluate our investments in joint ventures. In our review we focused on the recoverability of our investment relative to the market conditions that exist today. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to the assets in our joint ventures, including the evaluation of discounted future cash flows. Additionally we applied the standards of APB 18 to our investment balance relating to those ventures. In the third quarter we recorded a valuation adjustment of $43 million. This amount was 22% lower then the JV impairment charge we recorded in the second quarter of 2008. The segment detail is as follows: East segment $10 million; West segment $20 million; Other $13 million.  In addition this quarter we recorded $6 million of write-offs of notes receivables due to their uncollectability. The segment detail is as follows: West $1 million; Other $5 million.  Finally we review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist in accordance with FAS 142. As a result of this review our financial services segment recorded a $27 million write-off relating to the goodwill of this segment’s mortgage operations. So after that overview we’d like to open it up for questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: You touched on this in a few different ways, can you offer your opinion on what’s positive and maybe negative about the current talked about bail-out plan and then as it relates to a stimulus what would you think would be most helpful to the market that the government could do that they’re not doing?
Stuart Miller : The bail-out plan I think is still taking shape and I think that any commentary on that is premature. I mean, I think that everybody is looking at it and still trying to figure out exactly what it is. It certainly seems that we’re going to have something akin to an RTC type program, almost a throw-back to the early 90’s and if you look at the mass of assets that are embedded in the financial structures, there’s going to have to be some kind of a movement from private to public and then a repackaging of those assets and distribution back into the private sector like we saw in the early 90’s.  But exactly how they’re going to do this, the financial stress is far more complex this time around then it was in the early 90’s and I think we’re going to have to sit back and watch. As it relates to the housing market, I feel pretty strongly that if they don’t get housing prices to stop falling given the way that the fallen housing prices amplifies through financial structures to the securitizations that are out there and they way that those securitizations impact others, we’re just going to be chasing the market downward and each financial fix will be frustrated. And I said that in my comments. In terms of what constructive measures can be taken, the homebuilders had really tried to express as the July stimulus Bill went through Congress that the $7,500 interest-free loan was not likely to produce a lot of activity in the market. When that was the result we were hopeful and we tried to support it, but the reality in the marketplace is that the Bill has really been a net negative. Our focus had been to kick-start the housing market and to get people buying again with a real tax credit more in the $15,000 to $20,000 per home range and we felt and continue to feel that its that kind of stimulus for a period of time—maybe its six months, that will be needed to kick-start the market, get people buying and therein support the fall in housing prices with purchase activity. The positive of that kind of program is that it doesn’t come with the stigma of moral hazard and does a lot to support the housing market. Sure there are other thoughts out there that are equally good; that’s just mine. 
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: On the idea of moral hazard, do you think the tax credit is beneficial to the idea of maybe buying foreclosures that are out there which are I assume pressuring, creating a lot of that home price pressure that you’re talking about?
Stuart Miller : I don’t know how to break it down perfectly, even in my own mind; I get a little confused on this. It just seems to me that we’re going to have to get the volume of purchasers up no matter how you cut it, to absorb foreclosures and to get the market buying again, and how its distributed, whether its foreclosures or new homes or whatnot, I just don’t know what that right formula is but it seems to me that anything that we can do to get people buying homes again and recognizing that there’s some fabulous values out there. If ever there’s a time to buy a home, now is it. Its just a matter of getting people over the hurdle of saying, I want to buy a home, and then getting them positioned with a down payment that they can come up with and a mortgage that is properly positioned and affordable to them.  It seems to me if we get people buying, the mortgages on today’s home prices will be secure, profitable to the lenders and the homes are more likely to go up over time because of the low pricing point that they’re at right now. 
Dennis McGill – Zelman & Associates: Do you have the payables number from this quarter?
Bruce Gross : The payables number from this quarter we can follow-up with you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt – Wachovia Securities
Carl Reichardt – Wachovia Securities: You talked about some phantom demand in August from down payment assistance and kind of pulling that forward, I was wondering if you could quantify that a little bit or talk about how responsive you think consumers were to those promotions and if that does the slight [inaudible] to potentially reverse it, if that does materialize, what that would do for you?
Stuart Miller : We’ve given that a lot of thought and if you look at August there was clearly a spike in the use of the down payment assistance programs and the promotions brought in a lot of buyers. As we dissected the flow of people coming in, we came to realize that a number of the people that ultimately used the down payment assistance program didn’t need the program but they used it because it was a good deal. We kind of view that the impact of its loss, the loss of the down payment assistance program, is going to be somewhere between 10% and 15% of the buying market right now. 
Carl Reichardt – Wachovia Securities: And do you have any thoughts on the potential for it—the elimination of it to get reversed?
Stuart Miller : I think in today’s market just about anything we can think of is on the table and there’s no way to handicap it and I don’t mean for that to sound funny, I think it’s just too tough to call. There’s clearly legislative consideration as to whether it should be—the program should be reinstated.  I think that overall from a policy standpoint we and the industry understand that as a policy matter its probably better not to have down payment then to have it in the long run, but I think that emphatically we believe that right now and today is not the time to cut off the blood supply to the patient that’s on the operating table. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Susan Berliner] – JP Morgan
[Susan Berliner] – JP Morgan: I think you had noted that you think impairments were going to go down pretty materially going forward, I was wondering how that drives with your thoughts on a price decrease going forward?
Stuart Miller : We do believe that our impairments will continue to fall. First of all our asset base is materially smaller then it was a year ago, but additionally we think that as David has said, clearly we’ve done a lot of very heavy lifting in terms of impairing our assets. Some of the impairments that you are seeing are reflective of those continued price decreases that you see in the marketplace and will continue to have what we call this clean-up until prices stop declining. But because of the smaller asset base and because we’ve done so much of the hard work already and brought out asset values down to clear profitability, or the ability to make a profit, our projection is even with prices declining we have a solidly stated asset base. 
David Collins : I would just add to that, that as prices have come down we’ve put a lot of attention to redesigning our product and focusing on bringing down construction costs as well as we’re delivering a smaller product and we’re focused on how do we maintain a high margin as the market is in the condition it is, and a lot of that is coming from the progress on construction cost reduction. 
[Susan Berliner] – JP Morgan: If you could provide any details on your bank availability or tangible net worth cushion, that would be great. 
Bruce Gross : We can say that we’re in compliance with all of our covenants and we believe we have enough cushion with tangible net worth and as you’ve asked the question in the past about borrowing basis, somewhat of a circular formula we have availability under our borrowing base, we have to use cash over $500 million first. Any cash that is used to buy inventory gets added back into the borrowing base so it’s a little bit circular but we are in compliance of all of our covenants as we’ve mentioned to you in the past. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Goldberg - UBS
David Goldberg – UBS: I was wondering, incentives were flat this quarter in the release but you commented pretty in depth and gave us big color on how conditions were getting worse through the quarter and how SG&A as a percent of revenue was higher because or wasn’t the operating leverage maybe that you thought there was going to be, and I guess I’m trying to understand how you’re thinking about profitability versus sales volumes now and maybe with that how it bakes into the impairment analysis in terms of the assumptions as you look forward?
Stuart Miller : As we went into June and July as I noted, the market just really fell off precipitously. We’ve tried to carefully manage a balance between volume and sales price and incentives, but we have decidedly favored not chasing volume and operating leverage in favor of reducing profitability. So we clearly have moved to a direction of saying that, you know what? Let’s decrease our volume. Let’s continue to cut overhead. Let’s continue to renegotiate construction costs, but we’re simply not going to chase volume. There’s no reason to build homes if we can’t do it profitably. 
David Goldberg – UBS: With regard to your sale of some of your equity interest and bringing in Hillwood into your JVs, replacing [Eleanor] and in some cases and then buying some of your equity interest, I was wondering if we could get some detail about what kind of cash that generated as selling your equity interest and also a little about how many JVs you’re still involved with with [Eleanor] and maybe just exposure on it and your comment about those deals a little bit?
Stuart Miller : Let me just comment conceptually, first of all the addition of Hillwood is a very positive addition. It was more in the nature of replacing a partner then a cash generator. I think the—it was important in [Hunter’s Point] to be able to bring on a partner that is enthusiastic about the future of that opportunity as Hillwood is and brings to the table some individual expertise as Hillwood does, replacing a partner in [Eleanor] that has similar expertise but has less appetite. So this was a very good strategic move for the company. In terms of the number of joint ventures that we have with [Eleanor], I think we have about seven and [Eleanor] continues to be a solid partner and financially very strong. So that’s a positive. Might there be other transactions with them, that’s something that’s opened to question. In markets like this you just have to figure that everything is on the table. 
Bruce Gross: The cash from the transaction brought in approximately $120 million of cash of which the majority of that about $80 million was used to buyout existing partners. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates: I think probably the most important thing you said was the 15% reduction in costs per square foot, what period did that relate to where the peak was? And secondly, break it down by either land or reversals of prior write-downs and labor and obviously the effect of changing your construction methods and overall cost of materials if you can or just a guess on it. 
Bruce Gross : The peak that we’re comparing to is 2006.
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates: What quarter?
Bruce Gross : I don’t have an exact quarter for you, but it was the earlier part of 2006.
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates: And how about the breakdowns of that 15%, how they come into various components, what percentage of how much is land, how much is reversals, or how much is materials, how much is redesign?
Stuart Miller : That 15% is all construction costs. I think that would be comparable sticks and bricks. Concurrent with that, we’re saying as an addition to that there was the redesign of homes which brought down square footages or redesign to a more efficient design and then on top of that as an addition and separate item, you would have impairments that are flowing through that are a component of that.  But I think that what we’re trying to highlight though, maybe not affectively highlighting it, is that clearly impairments are contributing to margin improvement but its been to a lesser proportion, and we can’t exactly delineate this, then say two or three quarters ago that the redesign contributed, that the reduction in construction costs contributed and the reduction in SG&A contributed.  Those latter three components are contributing a greater proportion to our margins. 
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates: So you’re saying that these other factors, you could have another five for each percent and you could actually be down 25% roughly? Say 5% from lower land, 5% from redesigns? Something like that? 
Stuart Miller : I guess if I had to give you my impression, I think that there’s less upside to realize from construction costs going forward. It’s a diminishing amount. I think there’s a greater upside to be realized from SG&A which will continue to contribute positively and product design, we’re getting very close to having our product designed across the country so that implementation is already being reflected as well. But all three of those together are really powering a better net margin. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods
Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods: On your financial services I noticed that if you add back the goodwill impairments there you would have recorded a profit of about $14 million. I wanted to know whether or not that was a good number to sort of think about going forward or if that was a figure that had maybe some one-time things in it?
Bruce Gross : As you take a look at that, let me break it into two pieces. One is [title] is on the track back to profitability so that component is going the right path. And the other component is the mortgage side which I think that’s a pretty good number on a go forward basis. We had one of the highest capture rates we’ve seen in some time at 87% but that’s been our focus and I think that’s probably a good number assuming that the number of government loans that we originate continue to be at these high levels because we make more on a government loan then we do on other loans. 
Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods: Relating to SG&A, I know this is a question that we chatted about last quarter, I think at that time you had talked about a 10% SG&A target and was curious as to what your anticipation is or what your thoughts are now about the [realisticness] of obtaining a 10% SG&A target which admittedly would be a very good result for you. Do you still think that’s in the offing here in the next quarter or two or do you think that maybe is not a realistic number?
Stuart Miller : If we think back to last quarter, I was rather emphatic about that number and I guess I have to say today that I feel less emphatic and optimistic about it primarily because of the way that revenues have come down really more then we had expected. But we are extraordinary focused on exactly that number and we do expect to be down below 10%. That’s going to be easier to have happen as the market starts to return and revenues go up. Are we going to hit it in the fourth quarter? I’m a lot less optimistic about that right now. We’re going to have to wait and see. I will tell you that in going to our operating reviews this is the primary focus within each division and a number of our divisions are actually going to be there.  But I think that overall we might fall a little short of that number. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: On the cash flow generation, it looks like you generated operating cash flow of about almost $800 million through the second quarter, the additional $100 million this quarter, right now what are your expectations for the fourth quarter and looking ahead based on your current expectations for the business and the market and with your backlog down over 40% here, directionally where do you see cash flow generation in 2009 versus 2008?
Bruce Gross : As far as the fourth quarter goes, we don’t have an exact number for you but we can tell you is that we are incredibly focused in continuing the manage our inventory very carefully so we continue to focus on managing inventory both from delivering homes that are available to be delivered as well as reducing our land purchases. And that’s where the majority of cash flow generation is coming from. Of course it depends a little bit on the market as far as what holds for the fourth quarter as well as going into 2009, however again we’re very well positioned from an inventory perspective as we look forward and again in 2009 we expect to be cash flow positive. We haven’t put out an exact number at this point though. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: So what would you expect land spend to be in 2009 versus 2008 and if you could break that out between new raw land purchases versus development costs?
Stuart Miller : We’re not making any projection. In today’s market we’re not looking forward. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: I think last quarter down payment assistance was about 33% in 2Q, I was just wondering what that number was for the third quarter?
Bruce Gross : The third quarter number was about 45% and that’s 45% of the 87% of loans we originated. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin - Citigroup
Josh Levin – Citigroup: As you look at the economic and housing market landscape on both the challenges and opportunities, how do you think about the possibility of the [issue] of equity over the next year? 
Stuart Miller : Everything is on the table all the time in a market like this. We’ve seen tremendous volatility over the past couple of weeks. Looking ahead we’re just not making any projections right now as to anything that we might or might not do. Fortunately as we’re situated today, we’re in a good cash position. Our balance sheet is strong and we don’t have immediate need for cash but I’m not going to take anything off the table either. 
Josh Levin – Citigroup: As far as I know you haven’t been on the road talking to investors in quite some time, but as I understand it you’re thinking about going out on the road and talking to investors in the fourth quarter, what’s the logical rationale behind your decision to go out now on the road, after such a long absence? 
Stuart Miller : I don’t know that it would be considered an absence. What we have done over the past couple of years is we’ve said we are more then happy to talk to investors at any time over the phone or here in our offices and we’ve had a number of investors come through and sit and go through our program.  It hasn’t been an absence; we just haven’t been out on the road. Our primary focus has been to manage our business and manage our operations and this has been an extremely full time job, seven days a week, working long hours. So the reason for the absence from presentations and the conferences has been so that we can focus our attention on running our business.  Now the fact that we’ve always been a participant in conferences and should we decide to join back in, it’s only because we have the time to do that because so much of the work that we have been working on is now effectively completed. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Hussey – Goldman Sachs
Chris Hussey – Goldman Sachs: You mentioned you thought there would be a 10% to 15% impact on the housing market from down payment assistance going away, do you mean that you think that new home sales, that’s statistic could go down another 10% to 15% just from down payment assistance going away?
Stuart Miller : There are too many factors to really—I can’t project what the number of new home sales is going to be and this is an estimate, its just seemed to us by looking through the numbers that we’re able to see, that its somewhere in the 10% to 15% range of potential buyers that are taken out of the market. Now will there be other things that come along that stimulate purchase that offset that? We’re just not sure but it seems like it’s not an insignificant impact. 
Chris Hussey – Goldman Sachs: Around cash flow and I think you mentioned you had made about $200 million of land purchases, from your JVs during the quarter, just trying to get your strategy there in terms of—what is your strategy in terms of cash preservation? Your cash balances have stayed relatively flat but they’re not growing as fast as they have been earlier in this cycle. Do you feel like you have the right amount of cash and now its time to take advantage of some of these land purchases or how should we think about that?
Stuart Miller: No we’re not taking advantage of land purchases in the market. There will be that opportunity in due time and I think that we’re really neatly positioned to be out there working through some of the distress as it presents itself and it will. I’ve noted before we’ve maintained our management team to be able to go out and take advantage of the market conditions as they ripen but we don’t think that now has been that time.  Where we have used some cash is in preservation of value and opportunity that exists within our portfolio and what I’ve tried to highlight is that within our joint ventures some of those ventures have been [stressed] either through venture partners that simply don’t want to continue on. We saw that certainly with the [Hunter’s Point] joint venture or we’ve seen venture partners that simply don’t have the liquidity to move on. And rather then abandon value or opportunity; we’ve used capital to opportunistically improve our position. So that’s the difference between what we’re saying and maybe what you’re seeing reflecting in the numbers. 
Chris Hussey – Goldman Sachs: Do you have any tax refunds that you can get this year that might trigger another big land sale like you did last year or is that all the way by the books now?
Stuart Miller : We don’t anticipate a land sale of that kind of magnitude. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank 
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank : I wanted to follow-up and ask about the call it the next generation RTC type vehicle that‘s being debated even today, there is the possibility that it will include the purchases of development and acquisition loans and may end up therefore unloading land like what happened in the early 90’s, now this is on top of a situation where a lot of capital has already lined up to buy these assets so I imagine it would have a big impact, I wanted to get your thoughts on the potential behavioral impact. Does this freeze the market as people kind of assess and wait to see what this vehicle is going to do from a builder perspective for example, would you prefer to be buying it from a—prefer to replenish your land portfolio by buying from this next generation RTC versus the distressed funds that are being set up? I just wanted to get your thoughts on the behavior and how it changes the landscape. 
Stuart Miller : First of all its interesting I agree with you, there’s a lot of capital that is kind of lined up on the sidelines but it is neatly tucked away on the sidelines in large part because that capital doesn’t quite know how to—in large measure doesn’t know how to look at a diverse array of portfolios or properties that are out there.  And so that capital is going to have to find a machine. The question is will the capital find machines, meaning management teams that are able to convert what is distressed land assets, undeveloped land assets, into developed home sites. I think at the end of the day if you look at where kind of we’re headed, our primary business will be looking to buy developed home sites from a land machine that is able to develop home sites and offer them at an appropriate price.  We are clearly going to have to wash a lot of land through whatever distress program is out there before we have an appetite to purchase those developed home sites. I think across the country we’re seeing a mismatch between what it takes to buy a home site and make a gross margin versus what sellers are willing to or perhaps are able to sell for and so its really going to be washing through distress, through these capital reservoirs that purchasing, and marrying up with the machine to actually develop home sites at a price that a homebuilder can make a margin on.  I’ll say additionally that other parts of our company will probably be participatory in that process and its one of the things that we’ve maintained is that land machine focus, to marry up with capital. 
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank : This sounds a little more conservative let’s say, if you take your Lennar’s historical actions on a strategic scale. You’ve tended to do things directly and on a larger scale so, am I hearing you correctly? Is this a more kind of conservative stance going forward compared to the historical profile?
Stuart Miller : No I think that if you go back to the early 90’s and you look at the way that we emerged from the distress market in the early 90’s, we did exactly what I’ve just described. We came out of that distress period and we combined our operating machine with capital reservoirs that were available and ready to get involved in the distress. You might or might not even know but we actually grew an entire company that became well, it became [L&R] out of that early distress.  And we’re looking at it very much the same way. 
Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank: In terms of promotional activities, we’ve been hearing from some of the other builders that promotional activities are wearing out in their effectiveness. National sales drives for example since so many people are doing them have been losing their effectiveness. You had even mentioned last one or two quarters ago when we spoke about shifting more to incentives along the lines of financial services, the government’s $7,500 tax credit obviously stacks up very poorly against what the builder is already doing so I just wanted to get your thoughts on what marketing tactics are working right now if any, and how are you shifting your behavior in response to that? 
Stuart Miller : As I noted, June and July were just beyond our expectations in how far they had fallen off. August showed an uptick and it was primarily because of promotion and I’d be surprised if that isn’t the case with other builders as well. It was a promotion that was geared towards the down payment assistance and getting under the wire of its elimination. And this was across the country and multiple builders and not in concert; I’m just saying that we noted that in a lot of places our competitors were doing the same.  So what promotions are working? The answer to that question is it’s a day by day evaluation. Each new data point in the marketplace gives rise to the next promotion. Hopefully at some point what will resonate with buyers is a combination of the fact that home prices are really at a very, very low point right now, especially new home prices. And put that together with a mortgage program that works for them and the availability of down payment money and they’ll step up and buy homes. 
But that’s not for right now. :
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath – [Barclay’s Capital]
Megan McGrath – [Barclay’s Capital]: On the follow-up on your JV recourse that you talked about, how you’re three-quarters ahead and have gotten it down to around 492, I’m wondering if you can give us a sense of the mechanism by which you’ve reduce that? How much of it was cash that you used to pull down inventory and the debt came away, how much of it was accounting perhaps moving it from recourse to non-recourse?
Bruce Gross : The number we’re comparing to was last quarter was $807 million of maximum recourse indebtedness with unconsolidated JV’s. This quarter it was $630 million. The number you mentioned was net of reimbursement agreements which is not in the covenant calculation. So we’re looking at a reduction of about $177 million and we paid about $58 million of cash relating to that reduction. So it’s a cash component relating to that and then additionally it had different land sales, land splits, etc. that would be the remainder. 
Megan McGrath – [Barclay’s Capital]: What are those numbers? Do you have those numbers available versus let’s say the fourth quarter of 2007?
Bruce Gross : I don’t have them on the call here, but I’d be happy to follow-up with you. 
Megan McGrath – [Barclay’s Capital]: You mentioned in your last 10-Q that you may have to take a FAS 109 charge at the end of the year, now that we’re one more quarter in, do you have any feeling on the likelihood that you might have to write that asset down?
Bruce Gross : No we do not. That’s something that we’ll review with our auditors as we get to the end of the year. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research
Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research: On the distress land assets you were discussing before, I wanted to know if you’ve heard more from bank workout teams if the activity from the bank side is ticking up?
Stuart Miller : No. I think that the banks—are you talking about in terms of selling assets?
Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research: Correct.
Stuart Miller : No, I think that the banks are pretty much immobilized right now and maybe this is out of school for me to say, but I think that banks are concerned with maintaining Tier 1 capital right now and the impairment to the assets on their books could probably—it’s a matter of survival right now. 
Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research: In your prepared remarks you discussed that your competitive forces in certain areas whether its builder competitors or resales or new home communities are declining, are there areas of the country that are more clear for Lennar or I guess a more clear playing field for Lennar then others?
Stuart Miller : What do you mean by a more clear playing field?
Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research: In terms of less communities, say private builder bankruptcies opening it up for Lennar to go out and build more homes etc?
Stuart Miller : I think that that would apply to almost every market that we’re in. It is very clear that the smaller builders are pulling back, if not going out of business. We’re seeing this in all communities, over all geographies right now and in terms of the number of communities, as communities are burned off there are just no replacements out there.  Thank you everybody. We appreciate your attention relative to our third quarter and look forward to another productive quarter in the fourth. Thank you and goodbye.

Operator:  I would like to introduce your speaker for today’s conference, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Mr. Miller, you may begin. 
Stuart Miller:  Thank you and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2008 update. I am joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer; Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Treasurer and David Collins, our Controller.  Bruce is going to give some additional detail on our numbers as is traditional and David is going to give you an update on our asset review and impairment, a report that we have now given for over two years. Diane, of course, will be available to participate in our Q&A.  Just as a housekeeping item before I start I’d like to request that in our question-and-answer period that will follow our opening remarks that you please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. We of course welcome you to rejoin the queue if you have additional questions and we will attempt to answer as many as possible in the hour, more or less, that we have allotted for the call.  So let me begin. The housing market has continued to deteriorate throughout the first half of 2008 and as I noted in our press release this morning we expect this trend is going to continue for at least the remainder of the year. The deterioration that unfolded so quickly in the housing market so quickly in the past years has now spread to the overall economy. While there are some who still suggest we might avoid a recession and believe the economy will continue to grow, though at a slower pace, their case is becoming more and more difficult to make in the face of rising unemployment data, record low consumer confidence figures and a credit crisis that is constraining the movement of capital.  Even as the FED spoke yesterday and noted that the threat to growth had eased, that is until the stimulus checks are spent, it is apparent that inflation moves as a driver of potentially higher interest rates if not sooner than probably later. This is the simple reality of the market in which we are operating and these conditions are likely to persist for some time.  I am asked regularly as to whether or not we are at the bottom. I feel overall that we are not there yet. A little over a week ago our senior management team visited with each of our divisions over a two week period as we did our Ops review. We reviewed each of our divisions in detail and evaluated the dynamics of each market in which they operate. Generally speaking there are not yet signs of stabilization in the field. Demand patterns are inconsistent and erratic and we find that there is a constant and increasing flow of foreclosures that are maintaining downward pressure on prices and appraisals. In many markets it is apparent that the flow of foreclosed homes is expanding rather than subsiding.  There is a silver lining in all of this, though it is currently of limited consequence. The positive news from the field relative to some markets is that inventory of finished homes is coming down. The number of open, competing, new home communities is declining and the number of builders is also declining.  In spite of this rather sobering market information that we learned in our Ops review, we also learned that we are making a great deal of progress in adjusting our business to not just survive but to succeed in this difficult environment. We are focused on a quarterly progression of positive trends in this down market environment. I’d like to walk through some of the elements that will contribute to these trends that we saw as we visited each of our divisions.  First and foremost every one of our divisions has made the transition from being primarily focused on asset management to being primarily focused on their manufacturing business. Assets have been sold or written down; joint ventures have been re-structured or resolved. In fact we have reduced our number of joint ventures from 270 at the peak to about 163 currently. Our overall land asset is down similarly and additionally each division brought tremendous focus on inventory homes in the second quarter and reduced completed inventory by almost 50% sequentially.  Great progress has been made on the asset side of the business so management can focus on sales, construction and inventory. Our divisions are back to the basics of blocking and tackling pure home building. We have gone back to the basics on product. In our reviews we have found that every division as re-worked its product for the current market environment.  That means simpler product, fewer plans and a fresh look at scaling back included features. Each division has positioned product to offer excellent value and to be able to compete head to head with our toughest competitor, foreclosure sales. Square footages are generally smaller and product design is simpler. This competition is based on pure value.  We reviewed sales and marketing efforts. On the sales front we are using the Internet sales machine more effectively and extensively than ever. Division presidents are personally immersing themselves in our Internet sales program and driving up the learning curve. Currently each division is treating the Internet sales team more like a general realtor with the ability to cross-sell across Lennar product offerings in the market.  By doing this we have increased our Internet sales results by more than triple. On the market front Kay Howard has initiated a series of corporately generated and coordinated sales events that have gotten our divisions to engage in a friendly competition within the company. We have found that every division has been thoroughly engaged in these programs and enhanced their sales performance with participation. Focus was brought through these programs to manage a lower cancellation rate and this contributed to a cancellation rate that has been more than a 3-year low of some 22%.  With simpler products we have seen tremendous results in reducing construction costs. With the leadership of Mike Foster in Tampa we have revamped our purchasing efforts to benefit from regional and national efficiencies as we have moved across all divisions to disassemble labor and material contracts and begun purchasing on a unit basis for labor and materials separately.  We are seeing costs come down by as much as 20%, some of which is flowing through our numbers today and some will be coming over the next quarters. Because our standing inventory levels are extremely low and current, less than 100 homes per community, new home construction costs are defining the cost structure of most of our deliveries especially as we get into the third and fourth quarters.  Our divisions are using purchasing practices and product simplicity to become the low-cost producers in their market.  On the SG&A front, SG&A will be at 10% of revenues or lower in each division by year-end. This is our focus and our directive and there are no excuses. We found that many of our divisions are already there or below. Practically speaking a few might not make it but overhead is coming down quickly and every division was impressive in displaying their attention to this metric.  So with construction costs coming down and overhead reduced, products repositioned and land costs at proper levels where are margins going? Our net home building margin is beginning to improve with a positive net margin of 0.5% excluding valuation adjustments. While this margin is decidedly weak we expect we will continue to see improvement in margins that will begin to market trend. Of course the wild card is going to be sales pace and sales price and right now we are in what I call a price taker business with no pricing power.  With market conditions as they are we recognize that some things are just out of our control and we’re simply not going to be able to control those elements. But the items that are in our control we are all over them in each of our divisions.  On the corporate side we have complemented the progress in the field. Our balance sheet remains strong with a substantial cash position of $880 million plus. While this is down some $200 million from the first quarter we are decidedly using cash to seize opportunity where distress creates unique value rather than walk away from that opportunity. We anticipate we will continue to use another $200-300 million of cash over the next quarters for additional opportunities as they arise. We are building our business for the future.  Additionally there is nothing borrowed on our revolver and we have a responsible debt to total cap position at 39.5%, net of cash under 30%. In the wake of the meaningful re-statements of assets we have undergone, and the re-positioning of many of our joint venture properties this is meaningful progress.  While we continued to lose money in our first quarter with a loss per share of $0.76 and a home building operating loss of approximately $140 million, aggregate levels of impairment and losses are more the nature of clean up rather than reconciliation to unknown market conditions. We have done the heavy lifting on impairment and are now situated with stated assets that can and will produce improving margins when the rate of declining market pricing subsides. We are very confident that even with continued degradation of market conditions our stated asset base will not suffer nearly the levels of impairment we saw in 2007.  We have re-worked or are close to a re-work on most of our non-performing joint ventures. The trend on joint ventures is positive. As I noted earlier the number of joint ventures has come down materially and Bruce will give some additional color on some of the financial metrics.  While we will not and cannot comment on specific ventures, we have held true to our conviction that we do not support the debt of non-recourse obligations and we are not excusing partners from sharing partnership losses. While the negotiation process can be difficult and time consuming, many of our partnerships have presented us with an opportunity to actually enhance our investment position.  Let me briefly comment on the Land Source joint venture that many have asked about. As the press has reported, that venture has now gone into bankruptcy and the judge will consider a plan of re-organization. As much of this is ongoing, I will not comment specifically on the case but as it relates to Lennar one should recall that the $1.2 billion of debt is non-recourse and that Lennar’s investment on our books is zero. So as large as this asset might seem the potential impact to the company is not material.  In conclusion let me say that we have made a great deal of progress in this very difficult market. We have prepared our company for market conditions as they currently exist and we are not projecting a material improvement for some time to come. This should not be confused with abject pessimism. In fact, I remain quite optimistic about our business and about the housing market in general. This market will rebound. It will have to rebound in order to stimulate the rest of the economy back onto its feet.  Whether over the next month, or after the election, steps will be taken out of necessity to facilitate home ownership’s leadership out of the economic doldrums. The indicators keep coming and while there is discussion and disagreement back and forth on how to fix things, it seems that we are quickly approaching the time where decision makers will reconcile to the reality that positive, decisive steps need to be taken to properly support weakened markets and enable them to recover. We believe that an integral part of the answer that will emerge is that fixing the component of the economy that has led us into economic contraction (i.e. home building) will be the first and most important step in leading us out.  This fix is the bright light that I see at the end of home building’s dark tunnel. As I noted already, the home market is faced with increased supply and suppressed demand, home inventories, primarily existing homes, are expanding and will have to be absorbed before pressure is relieved from sales volume and from price. At Lennar we have been heads up throughout the downturn in the housing market and we have prepared our company to succeed in the current market conditions and to thrive when the market ultimately corrects.  With that let me turn it over to Bruce. 
Bruce Gross:  Thank you Stuart and good morning. I’ll be providing some of the financial details supporting the significant progress that Stuart just outlined with our balance sheet strategy, our JB recourse debt reduction, and our return to positive operating margins.  Starting with the results of our balance sheet strategy we remained focused on aggressive asset management and maintaining ample liquidity. We have continued to carefully manage our inventory levels as they have been reduced by 47% from $7.3 billion in the prior year’s second quarter to $3.8 billion during the current quarter excluding consolidated inventory not owned.  The finished homes and construction in progress inventory was reduced 39% from $3.6 billion to $2.2 billion year-over-year and land under development was also reduced 56% from $3.7 billion to $1.6 billion. This quarter we continued to cleanse our balance sheet as we aggressively reduced our unsold completed homes by 70% from 1,441 in the prior year to 428 in the second quarter and sequentially it was also down 47% from the first quarter of 2008.  We have continued to manage starts to today’s demand levels and as a result homes under construction declined 42% from 11,200 in the second quarter of last year to about 6,500 in the second quarter of 2008. Our home sites owned and controlled were reduced by 61% since the peak in 2006 from approximately 346,000 to 134,000 home sites in the current quarter. That break down is 73,000 home sites owned; 15,000 controlled by option of third-party land sellers and 46,000 options from joint ventures.  Land purchases during the quarter were $162 million and that is a 72% decline from the prior year. Any land purchases that we are making are very strategic. They are priced to generate high returns, taking current market conditions into account, and they are structured to protect us if there is further decline in the market place.  Our continued balance sheet focus continues to position us with excellent liquidity. In the second quarter we returned to a positive EBIT margin before valuation adjustments of about $2 million. As Stuart mentioned our liquidity position was strong with about $882 million of home building cash on the balance sheet and additionally there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Inclusive of impairments our net home building debt to total capital improved to 28.7% this quarter from 29.6% in the second quarter of last year and our home building debt to total capital was 39.5% versus 31.6% in the prior year’s quarter. Our debt level is down $275 million since the prior year’s second quarter.  There has been significant progress made in both the reduction in the number of joint ventures as well as the reduction in joint venture recourse. The company has focused aggressively on reducing the number of JV’s which was at a peak of approximately 270 JV’s in 2006 and now there are 163 joint ventures as of the end of the second quarter.  Of these joint ventures, however, only 57 have recourse debt. 31 have non-recourse debt and 75 have no debt. Our primary focus has been to reduce the joint ventures with recourse debt which is already down from approximately 100 in 2006 to the 57 remaining joint ventures with recourse debt at the end of this quarter.  The maximum recourse JV indebtedness was approximately $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2006. That has been reduced aggressively by about $1 billion and we ended the quarter with $807 million of recourse indebtedness in joint ventures. Sequentially this was also reduced significantly from $917 in the first quarter. Lennar’s net recourse JV exposure was also reduced to $613 million at the end of the quarter.  There has been a lot of attention directed to our joint ventures and I would like to emphasize that in addition to very significant reduction in JV recourse indebtedness, these joint ventures were conservatively financed at the time when the debt was put in place and these JV’s with net recourse debt exposure to Lennar have a total of $1.2 billion of partner’s equity in place at the end of this quarter.  We are confident that we will continue to significantly reduce the JV recourse debt exposure in each of the next several quarters. There was also significant progress in the reduction of financial letters of credit which were cut by more than half from the $728 million outstanding at the end of 2006 to $337 million at the end of this quarter.  Turning to the operating results for the quarter, we had a $0.16 loss for the quarter which excludes $137 million of pre-tax valuation adjustments, which David will walk through in a few minutes. Revenues from home sales decreased 62% to approximately $1 billion. That was driven by a 58% decrease in home deliveries and an 8% decrease in average sales price to $274,000.  The average sales price is net of sales incentives which averaged $48,700 per home during the quarter which increased about $5,000 per home compared to the prior year. The average sales price by region is as follows: East $254,000 which was down 11% from the prior year; Central $210,000 which was up 1%; West $364,000 which was down 16% and the “Other” region was $302,000 which was down 5%.  In the second quarter of 2008 we achieved the first positive operating margin since the first quarter of 2007. Our gross margin was 15.9% before valuation adjustments and selling, general and administrative expenses were 15.4% resulting in a 50 basis point positive operating margin. The pre-impairment gross margin improved 230 basis points over the prior year and the improvement in gross margin is primarily due to a lower land basis but additionally as Stuart mentioned our focus on repositioning and re-designing our product to meet market demand while continuing to aggressively focus on reducing construction costs in all areas of the company.  The East segment of the company experienced the largest improvement in margin during the quarter. We have acted aggressively to right-size our SG&A during the downturn and we have made significant progress on reducing the variable component of SG&A and now we are beginning to see the results of our progress on the fixed component of SG&A.  We are at the back end of division consolidations and head count reductions as our associate head count has been reduced from the peak in 2006 by approximately 60% through today. SG&A was reduced by $239 million during the quarter which is a 60% reduction from the second quarter of last year. As a percentage of revenue SG&A was up 70 basis points compared to last year’s second quarter but sequentially from the first quarter of this year it was down 300 basis points.  The progress that has already been completed and the actions taken give us the confidence to say our divisions are on track to achieve the future annualized SG&A run rate of 10% by the end of our fiscal year.  New orders were down 45% during the quarter compared to the prior year. The number of homes in backlog declined 52% year-over-year and in this quarter we delivered over 100% of our backlog. Our backlog conversion rate this quarter was 113%. We had a 22% cancellation rate compared to 29% in the prior year’s quarter.  Our financial services profits decreased from $14.2 million profit to a loss of $3 million. Mortgage increased from $4.6 million of profit last year to $8.1 million in the current year and that was primarily due to the prior year having a $14.4 million land note receivable write down. This quarter our mortgage capture rate improved from 72% to 85% year-over-year and almost all of our loans in this quarter were fixed rate, conforming loans. The percentage of government loans increased to approximately 60% this quarter, up from 19% in the prior year. This is the first quarter that the higher FHA mortgage loan limits went into effect.  Our title company experienced a $10.7 million loss that compares to an $8.1 million profit in the prior year. This was the result of fewer transactions as well as $6.7 million of non-recurring expenses primarily related to severance and lease termination costs as we focused on right-sizing our operations to current market conditions.  As we indicated on the first quarter conference call our tax rate will fluctuate through the year based on results. This quarter we adjusted our tax rate to 36% year-to-date tax rate. Some of you have called last night or this morning asking about the shelf registration filing yesterday. This is a routine filing to reinstate our shelf that was in place for several years and expired last week.  With that I’d like to say that we have made significant progress again this quarter and we look forward to discussing additional progress again next quarter.  With that I’d like to turn it over to David.   
David Collins:  Thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. As is tradition during our conference calls we are once again providing an update of our impairment process to provide further clarity. In this morning’s release we outlined our second quarter valuation adjustments of $137 million. We continue to remain actively engaged in our rigorous process of division by division asset reviews to ensure that our assets are properly stated.  We started this impairment process about two years ago and were diligent early on in reviewing our asset base and reporting impairments. As we have previously disclosed we believe that most of the heavy lifting regarding impairments is behind us and that we are at the tail end of the impairment cycle.  Let me quickly summarize our second quarter impairments.  First, on the home building side of our business we once again applied the standards of FAS 144 to land that we intend to build homes on and recorded a valuation adjustment of $74 million. The segment detail is as follows: East $34 million; Central $17 million; West $20 million and “Other” $2 million.  The second bucket is land that we sold or intend to sell to third parties. Consistent with our strategy of converting inventory into cash we identified land that we sold during the second quarter or intend to sell subsequent to the second quarter. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to that land and recorded a valuation adjustment of $2 million. The segment detail is as follows: East $1 million; West $1 million.  The third bucket relates to land, option deposits and pre-acquisition costs. We continue to evaluate, re-evaluate and re-negotiate deposits on land under option as markets remain challenged. For those option contracts where we were not able to adjust or readjust the terms to a level that we believe would lead to an acceptable return based on current market conditions we made the decision to walk away from the contract as we have done in past quarters. As a result, we wrote off $7 million of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs which represented approximately 2,100 home sites. The segment detail is as follows: East $3 million; Central $1 million; West $1 million and “Other” $2 million.  The fourth and last bucket is our joint ventures. As we do with all of our assets we continue to evaluate and re-evaluate our investments in joint ventures. During this impairment cycle we have reported cumulative adjustments to our investment in JV’s of $726 million. In our review we focused on the recoverability of our investment relative to the market conditions that exist today. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to the assets in our joint ventures including the evaluation of discounted future cash flows. Additionally, we applied the standards of AVB 18 to our investment balance related to those joint ventures. In the second quarter we recorded a valuation adjustment of $55 million. The segment detail is as follows: East $12 million; West $43 million.  So after that overview we would like to open it up for questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions)  The first question comes from the line of Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: Bruce I think I heard you correctly but on the FHA side did you say that was 60% of the volume? 
Bruce Gross:  That is correct. The government loans were 60% of the mortgage loans that our mortgage company originated which was 85% capture rate. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: So that would be on closing for that? 
Bruce Gross:  That is correct. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: Can you elaborate on that a little bit? I think there might have been some promotions related to that in the quarter but would you say that is abnormally high? Would you think that goes higher in the coming quarters based on what you are seeing in backlog? 
Bruce Gross: Yes I think we have been saying for a couple of quarters now there has been an increase in the FHA loans and the FHA loans which require a much smaller down payment are the attractive financing source that is available out there today. We do believe that the higher FHA percentage is likely to continue at this point. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: Just because it has been in the news flow related to the down payment assistance, is that something that you guys participate in any meaningful volume? 
Bruce Gross:  We have had down payment assistance for several years now and there are a percentage of our buyers that do use the down payment assistance. It was about 1/3 of the loans we originated during the quarter but again I think one of the things to highlight is the difference between down payment assistance and FHA is about $6,000 of down payment on our typically priced home. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: Switching gears, maybe this is best suited for you Stuart, but just thinking of your top level view and how the shrinking of capital from banks for both residential and I guess even commercial lending is taking place what your view is over the next year as more land comes to market via foreclosure similar to what has happened on the house side and what that might mean for both land values going down and potentially opportunities for well capitalized builders? 
Stuart Miller:  I’m not sure I fully got the question but I think what you are asking is with available capital somewhat constrained are there going to be dollars available for people to buy homes. The answer is I think there will be dollars for people to buy homes. It will be primarily through either FHA programs or GSE programs. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: I’m sorry for mixing the two themes up but I was referring more to on the lending side to builders and developers themselves and builders that are struggling with the capital structure and not able to perform on their loans and forcing some of that back on the market on the repossessed side…builders that do have capital how you see that playing out. 
Stuart Miller:  I think that exists right now today. I think that constraint is out there and it is creating what I refer to in my comments as some of the distress that is in the market. We are seeing it probably first in the joint venture arena and it is creating opportunities even today at today’s depressed pricing and sales pace levels. It is those kinds of opportunities we think are going to mark the future for the industry. For the well capitalized builder there will be those opportunities to re-build their business around. These opportunities aren’t out in the market right now. They haven’t surfaced yet but they are coming. I think that as market conditions continue to weaken over the next year and especially the credit side of the business gets more difficult there will be more opportunities to start making purchases where healthy margins can be garnered. 
Dennis McGill – Zellman & Associates: Thus far you haven’t been active in any type of bank owned properties yet? 
Stuart Miller:  We have been very active but Dennis we are going to have to move on to the next person. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt – Wachovia Securities. 
Carl Reichardt – Wachovia Securities: I had a question the specs down at less than one per community, is that relatively concentrated regionally or is that kind of a more average across the board? Then what was the rough fall in communities year-over-year this quarter versus last? 
Bruce Gross:  Let me first address the spec inventory level. There has been a focused effort in every division in the company and every community to reduce the level of spec homes. We have seen that success throughout the company. It is not concentrated in any one particular geography.  In terms of the community level, Carl, the community count isn’t a number that we have given out for the quarter. 
Stuart Miller:  Bruce is stumbling because we just don’t give out community count as you know, Carl. The fact is our community count is down materially. In terms of the spec level no there is not concentration. In fact what was really very positive message take away from the quarterly Ops reviews was the fact that each division had really focused in on spec levels and in every single one of our divisions spec levels were down materially. 
Carl Reichardt – Wachovia Securities:  The one follow-up to that is then looking at backlog conversion being triple digits, are you sensing you are through this process enough given the assumption we don’t see a significant negative change in absorption pace? That is we look at backlog conversion the next several quarters we ought to see that come down relatively materially as you start to replenish the backlogs? Is that the way I ought to think about it? 
Bruce Gross:  I think over the next quarter you are still going to see very high backlog turnover conversion ratio, Carl. Our focus is to make sure the inventory levels are being managed tightly and we are not ending up with completed homes at the end of the day but I think you will see that conversion ratio stay at a high level over the next couple of quarters. 
Stuart Miller:  I think that is reflective of both construction time frames coming down and keeping our sales and construction pace very tightly tied together. I would expect it stays where it is. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of David Goldberg – UBS. 
David Goldberg - UBS: My first question is a little bit theoretical but you talk about taking the business from focusing more on regions on asset management to home building now and more efficiency. I guess what I’m trying to figure out is how does that impact the business over the long term? When things eventually do normalize do you think you transition somewhere in the middle? How easy is it to bring that specialty or ability back on? 
Stuart Miller:  As you know, David, at the highest level of the company we have maintained our management team intact and we think that is where the real franchise on the asset management side of the business is. What we have really done and we are really pretty excited about this, is at the division level we have our divisions focused on being real manufacturers. So as the market returns I think we are going to be at the forefront of being able to uncover some of the most sizeable and interesting opportunities because our top level management team is really expert at that. But in the field we are focused on sales, starts, closing, inventory levels and asset base making sure that our divisions are really focused on becoming a pure manufacturing machine.  One of the questions Doug was asked earlier by Dennis was are you participating in some of the bank deals that are out there. I think that is one of the unique things that does exist here at Lennar, the fact we are looking at just about every deal that is hitting the market. As you know Jeff [Kraznoff] is back with the business. Jeff and I have a long history looking at those portfolios. Likewise John, Rick and Neal. I think that there is an important balance between the manufacturing focus in the field and what the corporate office can bring to bear on more sizeable and more interesting deals that are lot more opportunistic. 
David Goldberg - UBS: I guess the second question talks to the impairments and the testing for impairments. How do you guys get comfortable that the last couple of quarters it has mostly been clean-up on impairments. But if you expect deterioration on the operating environment, certainly the order base is coming down, pricing is coming down and incentives are going up…how do you get comfortable that you are not going to see more impairments or sizeable impairments as you move forward? Maybe as a corollary to that is it correct to assume that the reason there haven’t been more impairments is that you have done a great job on the cost side of the business and that has offset some of the other inputs that have been more negative? 
Stuart Miller:  Okay, well there are a few things that combine in that. Number one lets remember that our asset base itself has shrunk materially so the amount of impairment that can possibly be out there is materially shrunk. Number two, when we did our impairment analysis as we did the past year we have anticipated the market would not be improving but instead would continue to decline. So the market conditions that I described in my opening comments are market conditions that we have anticipated. We have not had our head in the sand on this. To the contrary we have written our assets to a place where we are comfortable the statement of the assets will be properly positioned for the future even as the market continues to deteriorate.  Another element is the fact we have brought down our pricing in the field quite a lot. Probably more than the existing home market has. I think that there is less correction ahead for the new home market than there is for the existing home market.  The final point is that you were absolutely right, David, our cost structure is changing. We are bringing down construction costs at a very impressive rate. What I saw in the field with some of the initiatives that a gentleman named Mike Foster is spearheading across the company for us, is that both at the local, regional and corporate levels we are finding ways through unit cost pricing to bring down construction costs at an accelerated rate even where you have commodity prices going up. This is very important in the underwriting of future impairments. We think we are going to be able to be profitable in almost every one of our land positions going forward even in this declining market. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: My first question if you could just give us a little bit more detail on JV’s and it was good to see the recourse continues to come down. I was wondering if Bruce or Stuart could describe how much cash out went this quarter for JV’s, for debt pay down or on lines and where your total balance sheet investments stand? 
Bruce Gross:  Let me talk to the point of how much went out to joint ventures. The total contributions during the quarter to joint ventures were between $50-60 million and a smaller portion of that went to re-margining relating to joint venture debt. As far as the joint venture investment balance for the quarter that number is approximately $870 million at the end of May. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: So the $50-60 million includes any type of debt pay down as well as the recourse debt came down? 
Bruce Gross:  That is correct. Any contributions to joint ventures are in that line. The re-margining amount is a subset of that $50-60 million. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: Before I move onto the second question a small subset question on the JV’s if I could. Any update on Kyle Canyon or Heritage and where your exposure stands for those two ventures? 
Bruce Gross:  There is no update relative to Kyle. We don’t have any investment in Kyle. There is no update there. Heritage we still feel very good about. It is a very strategic joint venture for us that is [El Toro] and we are still going forward as we talked about in the past. 
Michael Rehaut – JP Morgan: My second question on land investment. I found that pretty interesting you spent $162 on. I was wondering if you could kind of break down how much of that was option take downs and how much of that was more opportunistic purchases and if you can give any color in terms of where those were and you also mentioned they were structured to protect Lennar from future declines. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit more detail there. 
Stuart Miller:  Mike we are very clever here. We know that you have now asked three questions and that third question had six parts to it. We see you. Mike, I think that what I’d have to say is that every dollar we spend right now is opportunistic. All of the dollars out. If we are not an option deal finding that we are buying into a good opportunity we are walking and we have done that aggressively. So when you look at the dollars we are spending on land and you are asking how much of that is opportunistic and how much is option, each of those option deals have either been re-worked or they have been walked from and they have been re-worked to a point where we feel that we have a good and solid opportunity. We are not land banking take downs and supporting deals and ventures and stuff like that. Each deal we are taking down today is opportunistic so I’d have to say all of it. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates.
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates:  Let’s go back to home building 101. Gross margins and SG&A. First of all on the gross margins of 230 it is a remarkable improvement you had. You said part of that was to a lower land base. How much of that was coming through a reversal of previously impaired projects and how much was related to your cost savings in materials and labor? 
Bruce Gross:  You know something Tim, we knew that question was going to be asked and we suspected it would be asked by you. We spent a lot of time thinking about the answer to that question and given the size of the impairment we have taken it is really hard to delineate that in a meaningful way because when I come down to that evaluation I would almost have to say that all of it is attributable to land write downs because so much of our land write downs affects every community we are in. So, unless we are taking down rolling option home sites. So it is not only hard, it is impossible to delineate where the margin improvement is coming from. What we can tell you is that what we have done is across the board re-written our land to a point where we can produce margin. As we go forward margin improvement will continue to come from construction cost reduction and from SG&A reductions.  Now, back to home building 101. On the construction cost side, as I said earlier, we are seeing construction costs that are coming down as much as 20%. Now that doesn’t mean 20% across the board but in many instances we are seeing that kind of improvement. If we look back over the past year and we look year-over-year we are probably seeing something short of….somewhere in the 7-8% range in terms of construction cost reduction. But as we look ahead we see more and more cost savings coming through. Now the land price is remaining fairly stable.  Finally on the SG&A level we are looking at an SG&A level that is really coming down from somewhere in the 15-18% range. 
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates: The question though on the second one, did you say…I couldn’t believe my ears…did you say you expected the SG&A rate as a percent of sales to be 10% in the fourth quarter? 
Bruce Gross:  At the division level we are expecting every division to be at that level by the fourth quarter. Now as I said, realistically and practically speaking there are going to be some divisions that don’t quite get there. But the amount of progress that has been made in that direction is striking and a number of our divisions have already gotten there and every one of them has a plan to get there by the fourth quarter. 
Tim Jones – Wasserman and Associates: When is the last time in the company’s history you had that? 
Bruce Gross:  Well these are different times. I don’t remember. I will say that is our focus today. Each of the components of the manufacturing business starting with SG&A is absolutely where we are focused. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Stephen East – Pali Research.
Stephen East – Pali Research : If you can talk a little bit, you talked some about the unique opportunities you were using your cash for, are those primarily attractive JV’s you would prefer to consolidate or would these be purely independent deals you are seeing coming down the pipeline? 
Stuart Miller:  Primarily right now JV’s and that is because that is where we are seeing distress turn into current opportunity. In the market at large we haven’t seen that much actually come through the pipeline. I noted before Steve that we are underwriting a number of deals and portfolios that are out there. Frankly the reality of market conditions has not yet really filtered through to the sellers so I kind of look at these as what I call warm-up exercises. What we saw in the late 80’s and early 90’s was it took some time for people to really reconcile.  Within our joint ventures where distress exists right there with us within our partnerships it is a straight negotiation where we can figure out where the opportunity exists and where common ground exists for the partner. 
Stephen East – Pali Research : On those JV’s are you agnostic as to whether or what the debt loads are? Whether they are debt free or have meaningful debt? 
Stuart Miller:  We underwrite everything looking at it as a pure opportunity and if there is debt or no debt we are going to deal with it the same way. We are not interested in taking on additional obligations where there isn’t meaningful opportunity for our future. 
Stephen East – Pali Research : If volume stayed at roughly the level we are running now how long do you think it would take you to get to a normalized operating margin looking at sort of what you talked about with the improvement in gross margin from your impaired land and moving your SG&A into a 10% type level? 
Stuart Miller:  What do you mean by normalized operating margin? 
Stephen East – Pali Research : Let’s call it a single point number, 8% for lack of a better point. 
Stuart Miller:  I can’t guess. You are embedding in your question a lot of assumptions. The market is staying where it is right now and there is no more downward trend and sales pace where it is now? I’m not even sure where it is now. As I said, you get very erratic weeks in terms of sales pace in the field so it is kind of hard to make the assumptions you are laying out. We do anticipate given a fairly steady trend line we do anticipate improving net margins as we go forward. How quickly we get to a net 8% is just too hard to call right now. 
Stephen East – Pali Research : One last question, your land supply you have now is fairly heavy for current volumes. Are you comfortable with that or would you like to bring that down over the next year or two? 
Stuart Miller:  No, I think we are comfortable with that. I think at some point, I’m not much into projecting right now, but at some point our production levels are going to come back up and the land that we have is going to be absorbed at a faster pace. I think that as we look at our land asset right now I think we have a sizeable land asset from the standpoint of number of home sites available but that is going to hold us in good stead going forward because I think that the business is going to come back. There is going to come a time where this foreclosure problem starts to subside and there is going to come a time where the demographics of this country start to kick in again and there is pent up demand. I think the swing is going to be strong. It just doesn’t happen to be in the next couple of quarters. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank North America. 
Analyst for Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank North America: I just wanted to try and get an idea of what percentage of your lots are fully developed? 
Bruce Gross:  I don’t have an exact percentage as to how many are fully developed but in terms of dollars I can kind of give you a rough order of magnitude that finished home sites are lets say approximately $900 million to $1 billion of our total inventory numbers we gave out earlier. 
Analyst for Nishu Sood – Deutsche Bank North America: I just wanted to see if you could elaborate on the foreclosure competition. Are these in your direct neighborhoods or adjacent areas? 
Stuart Miller:  It is an interesting question. We really focused on exactly that question within each of our divisions. What we have found is with the remaining communities we have, that is the communities we have not walked from, the number of foreclosures actually in our communities are fairly low. I’m going to give you some numbers and they are probably not good numbers but they are kind of indicative of the order of magnitude but we found there weren’t really situations where we found more than 20% of a community that had gone through elements of a foreclosure. By the way the term foreclosure seems to be confused throughout the industry right now. The foreclosure is sometimes referred to as loans in default or loans under judicial process or homes that have actually been taken back as REO or have been sold. So we’re looking at the whole span of homes that have either been sold as REO or homes that are actually in a default process right now, so that whole spectrum. It has been a smaller percentage than we thought it would be. Generally in the 20% range.  We are also finding that the clearing price for foreclosed home has not taken as big as a dip as we thought they might and in fact they are selling at least in our communities selling somewhat close to the sales price we are offering for new homes. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jim Wilson – JMP Securities. 
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities:  I don’t know if I missed it but in the California impairment on the JV’s is there anything there related to Land Source like for the management contract or anything or is it all from other JV’s? 
Bruce Gross:  No that would all be from other JV’s. 
Jim Wilson – JMP Securities: Anything you can comment on with the shelf filing and potential uses beyond the obvious that it could be anything? Is there anything it is targeted for? 
Stuart Miller:  There is nothing behind that filing. It is a filing that expired and in the normal course we are just re-filing. There is nothing to read into that Jim. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath – Lehman Brothers. 
Megan McGrath – Lehman Brothers:  I just wanted to ask quickly about your incentives. It ticked up a little sequentially and year-over-year. I was wondering if you could just talk about how your incentives have evolved. How the newer financing incentives seem to be working, or how they have changed over the past couple of quarters? 
Stuart Miller:  The question of incentives is a very locally driven question and what you are looking at in the corporate level is a roll up of a lot of very different programs that are working differently in different markets. So the incentive programs are left to our divisions and are very much focused on driving sales given current levels of market conditions. Really on a day by day, community by community basis that changes around to accommodate basically competing against our biggest competitor, as I said before, and that is the foreclosure market. I don’t think there are trends we can describe to you. I think you are actually seeing a lot of erratic data points that are combining to look like a trend and they don’t really represent a trend. 
Megan McGrath – Lehman Brothers: Just a quick one for Bruce. Your home building debt looked like it ticked up just a tiny bit quarter-over-quarter. Did you put a new JV down on the books or is that something else going on there? 
Bruce Gross:  There was a joint venture consolidation during the quarter and that is the only reason that increased overall for home building. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim – Credit Suisse. 
Dan Oppenheim – Credit Suisse:  I’m wondering if you can talk a little bit more on SG&A. You are talking about the outlook continuing to worsen and weak absorption as it is right now and your goal is to mark it down to 10% SG&A as a percentage of revenue. How is it you look at managing that and clearly we are getting close to the point where you are cutting some bone in the big markets. What is it that is involved in cutting SG&A at this point where you think you can keep sort of cutting away and keep business as we are going forward here? 
Bruce Gross:  That is a fair question Dan. Clearly as sales pace is moving around primarily in a downward direction and prices are moving down getting to a 10% level on revenues is a tricky business right now. We are only as good as our predictions and projections. You also highlight that we have cut away some of the fat and probably cut through some muscle and maybe hit some bone. But the fact is at the end of the day we are getting down to a very aggressively thin group of professionals in each division and we are consolidating divisions where possible and really bringing the machine down to its bare necessities. I think that a lot of the opportunities to cut come from the ability to eliminate communities that are not performing well. So as some of our communities bleed off it helps us bring down our SG&A and other efficiencies we see in the market like consolidating some of our purchasing effort at either regional or corporate levels or consolidating our marketing programs and having them come from a corporate level.  In each of these areas we are looking at ways to take cost out of the operating division and either combine them to generate efficiencies or to just eliminate them entirely. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research. 
Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research:  If I look at the dollar value of your backlog from the first quarter to second quarter it is the first time it has moved up in almost three years. I know you don’t make predictions but given what the current situation is, etc. can we reasonably expect a return to that seasonal pattern where it builds first, second and third and then decreases in the fourth? 
Stuart Miller:  No. I don’t think that we can expect to read any or see any patterns re-emerge for the time being. I think we are going to see some fairly erratic numbers that come through the system. Really what I back that up with is just the view ahead to the foreclosure market. I think if you look at the pipeline across the country particularly in some of the biggest markets, the foreclosure pipeline and that is the homes that are in default today just entering the judicial process, it is getting bigger not smaller. Barring something being done at the governmental level I think we are going to see more pressure going forward rather than opportunity to see typical selling patterns re-emerge.  So a lot of the patterns we see are going to be dependent on the inventory levels driven by the foreclosure market. There are wild cards out there. There are legislative opportunities that are in front of Congress right now that could ameliorate some of these pressures and we’re just going to have to wait and see. 
Jay McCanless – FTN Midwest Research: On the incentives I note there has been significant advertisement on your website, etc. for rate buy downs. Is that the primary incentive you are offering now or is it still a mix of option packages for the house plus the rate buy downs? How does the incentive picture look right now? 
Stuart Miller:  It is all of the above but the rate buy down incentive is a significant one. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Rashid Dahod – Argus Research. 
Rashid Dahod – Argus Research:  In response to an earlier question you mentioned the expected correction of existing home prices and some of the other builders have reported where their new homes are priced below comparable existing homes. I was wondering what market you are seeing that in or what percentage of markets you are seeing that in as well? 
Stuart Miller:  I think that what is being highlighted is the new home market corrected much more rapidly than the existing home market. So what you are seeing in the existing home market is the number of homes on the market at prices that are more reflective of yesterday’s values. I think this is a national phenomenon, not specific to any particular market. Basically you haven’t seen that reconciliation in the mind of the individual homeowner to the fact that home values have diminished to the extent they have. So we see this really across the country.  Now the foreclosure market is not having as much of a difficult time pricing to where the new home market is. 
Rashid Dahod – Argus Research: As existing home prices correct what impact do you think that will have on the new home sales and what is your strategy? 
Stuart Miller:  That is a good question. Listen I think that as existing home sales correct more and more it will put more competitive pressure just because you’ll have more legitimately priced inventory in the market place. But always remember that new homes compete very well against existing homes. They come with a warranty. It is not somebody else’s footprint on the home and so we will compete and do compete very well against comparably priced existing home and in fact the new home market typically trades at a premium to the existing home.  Now what I will say is that what you have seen over the past year or two is a quick correction in the new home market because the home builders have moved rather rapidly to reduce inventory levels. I noted in my comments one of the positives out there is that the new home market inventory level has come down precipitously and that is a real positive for pricing power in the future. 
Operator:  The next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods. 
Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods:  I wanted to see if I could ask you a couple of questions regarding what we might consider to be a normalized base. I know I’m going to get into a little bit of trouble here because you asked the other guy what normalized meant, but let me put it this way…you indicated your unsold, completed inventory was down 47% from just the previous quarter sequentially and I’ve been noticing your backlog conversion ratio has been extremely high for really the last three, in fact five quarters now, almost 100%. Given that you are not going to be delivering as many homes that were already sitting in your backlog completed I would think you might see your conversion ratio decline and therefore you would be doing more sort of a build-to-order type business. Is that what we should be expecting from you as soon as this third quarter or are there other factors I’m not thinking about? 
Stuart Miller:  Well at the same time that we are eliminating a lot of our inventory our production cycle is coming down pretty quickly as well. As part of our cost initiatives we are also very focused on cycle time and our cycle times have been coming down so that is going to offset some of that. 
Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods: You mean your natural cycle time as opposed to being influenced by cancellations and things like that? 
Stuart Miller:  Right. I think that you are seeing a lower cancellation rate. I don’t know we will sustain a 22% cancellation rate but I suspect it is going to be lower than where we have been over the past three years on a consistent basis. We are absolutely more focused on selling homes that are not under construction and there is more of that but we think our delivery time on those homes is going to improve as well.  So our backlog conversion ratio will move around a little bit but we think there will be some offsetting input to that on both sides. 
Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods: That result should be, I would think, some reduction in overhead carry and that sort of gets to my next question which is your SG&A rate. Now you talked about a divisional SG&A rate of about 10% as your goal. I just hadn’t heard you talk about that in prior years. I just want to make sure I’m understanding. So the 10% divisional SG&A rate pretty much aggregates up to a 10% SG&A rate as a percentage of home sale revenues that we would see on your income statement? Or is there some adjustment factor you can give us? 
Stuart Miller:  Number one the answer to the last part of the question is yes it should reflect on the income statement at that level. You are right, we haven’t really talked about it much. This has been a primary focus over the last year or year and a half and I just haven’t wanted to talk about it until I see real progress in the field. This last round of Ops reviews gave me a level of optimism about where we are actually going to land here. Now might it move around because volumes aren’t where divisions expect them to be or something? It is possible but we have made a lot of progress in this arena. 
Stephen Kim – Alpine Woods: Does that suggest your break even point in terms of absorptions per community to break even profit wise is reduced from where it was 2-3 years ago? 
Stuart Miller:  It is reduced materially. It has come down materially. 
Operator:  The final question comes from the line of Alex Barron – Agency Trading Group. 
Alex Barron – Agency Trading Group:  I don’t know if I missed it but did you mention what the cash flow from operations was for the quarter? 
Bruce Gross:  We didn’t mention it yet because the cash flow statement isn’t completed Alex. Essentially cash quarter-over-quarter was reduced about $200 million in total. 
Alex Barron – Agency Trading Group: My other question was I know you guys have already sold some land but of the communities you currently own I was wondering what percentage of those have been impaired at least once. 
Bruce Gross:  Currently of our total communities we have impaired 5% this quarter. We don’t really track a cumulative percentage count but we have impaired about 5% of our communities that is in our second quarter impairment number. 
Stuart Miller:  The other way for me to say that would be we have impaired 100% of the ones that should be impaired. I’m sorry we are not really directly answering your question. 
Alex Barron – Agency Trading Group: In terms of how…I know you guys have been doing these financing incentives with rate buy downs and paying closing costs and down payment assistance, how is that accounted for? Is that in the cost of goods sold? Is that part of SG&A? How does that flow through the income statement? 
Bruce Gross:  That is included in sales incentives which is a reduction to revenue. So it factors into the gross margin calculation. 100% of it. 
Alex Barron – Agency Trading Group: So it is basically the revenue is what is adjusted? 
Bruce Gross:  Yes. Sales incentives are a reduction of revenue and 100% of any cost relating to a buy down program is included in sales incentives which is a reduction in revenue. 
Stuart Miller:  That will be the last question for this morning. We appreciate everybody’s attention as we report our second quarter. We are optimistic about our progress and where we are in this tough market condition and look forward to reporting our third quarter. 
Operator:  That does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-03-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to Lennar Corp.’s first quarter earnings conference call.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode.  After the presentation we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  Today’s conference is being recorded.  If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.

Please note that Lennar assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except as required by Federal Securities Law.
Operator: I would like to now turn the call over to your conference host, Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO.  Sir, you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Good morning and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2008 update.  In the context of market conditions they continue to be difficult and frankly continue to deteriorate.  We would like to update you both on the status of the home building industry market conditions and on the strategy and progress of Lennar in particular. I’m joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer, and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and now our newly appointed treasurer – Congratulations Diane, and David Collins who is now our Controller – Congratulations David.  David has been a member of the Lennar accounting team for 10 years as our Director of Financial Reporting and has taken on the role of Controller as Diane has moved into our Treasurer position. Bruce Gross will provide additional detail on our numbers after my opening remarks and David will participate with an update on our asset review and impairment, a report we have given now for the past two years, and Diane will be available to participate in our question-and-answer. This is a housekeeping item before I begin…I would like to request that in our question-and-answer period that will follow my opening remarks, or our opening remarks, that you please limit to just one question and one follow-up so that we can be as fair as possible to all participants.  We welcome you to join or rejoin the queue if you have additional questions and will accept or attempt to answer as many questions as possible in the hour, more or less, that we have allotted to the call. As noted in our press release that we issued this morning, the housing market has remained challenged in the first quarter of 2008.  What is also beginning to become clear is that the rest of the economy has now followed suit and I believe has now slipped into recession.  The deterioration that took place so quickly in the housing market last year now seems to be happening at the same rapid pace in the overall economy. Data points these days are all over the place and are prone to misinterpretation and second guessing with each new report.  The only thing that seems clear is that regardless of what is reported in the news or by the economists, in the market, the grocery store, at the pumps and in the working world it just doesn’t feel good. The only real bright spot today is that when the news is particularly dire and is confirmed in some way, the government and other market forces have acted quickly and decisively.  While we might argue or suggest that actions are late, they do nonetheless suggest that there is a floor out there where enough negative news confirmed will result in enough action to bring on sustainable stabilization. It seems that we are now nearing that point of confirmation.  Today’s data, the GDP has slipped to 0.6% growth rate, is the beginning of confirmation.  A weakening labor market and growing jobless claims is confirmation.  Illiquidity in our financial market is confirmation.  Higher food and energy prices are confirmation.  The lowest consumer confidence numbers in five years is confirmation.  Reduced orders for durable goods is confirmation. The indicators keep coming and while there is discussion and disagreement back and forth on what they mean and how to fix things, it seems that we are quickly approaching the time where decision makers will reconcile to the reality that positive, constructive steps need to be taken to properly support weakened markets and enable them to recover. We believe that an integral part of the answer that will emerge is that the fixing of the component of the economy that has led us into this economic contraction, i.e. home building or housing, will be that first and most important step and fix in leading us out. This fix, it seems, is the bright light that I see at the end of home building’s dark tunnel.  As I noted in our press release, the home market is faced with an increased supply and a suppressed demand.  Home inventories, particularly existing homes, are expanding and will have to be absorbed before pressure is relieved on sales volume and price.  If we are going to get home ownership back on its feet we are going to need to facilitate the absorption of inventory by encouraging buyers to start purchasing again and we are going to have to facilitate a mortgage market to be able to lend at multiple price points to those purchasers. Whether over the next six months or after the election, these steps will be taken out of necessity to facilitate housing’s leadership out of the economic doldrum.  This is simply my view of today’s landscape. But what do we at Lennar do in the interim?  Well this is exactly what we have prepared for and exactly why we have taken the steps we have taken.  We have done the things over the past 24 months that have situated Lennar for success going forward.  As you can begin to see in our first quarter results, we have made quite a lot of progress in having our company prepared. First and foremost our balance sheet has been fortified with a substantial cash position of over $1 billion, nothing borrowed on our revolver and a responsible debt-to-total capital position at 38% to 38.2% and net debt-to-total capital of 24.5%. In the wake of the meaningful restatements of assets that we have undergone and the repositioning of many of our joint venture properties this is meaningful progress.  While we continue to lose money in our first quarter with loss of $0.56 per share and home building operating loss of just under $110 million, aggregate levels of impairment and losses are clearly now dissipating. We have done the heavy lifting on impairment and are now situated with stated assets that can and will produce improving markets when the rate of decline in market pricing subsides.  We believe that even with continued degradation of market conditions our stated asset base will not suffer nearly the level of impairment that we have seen to date. Next, our home building margin is beginning to improve.  With a 50 basis point improvement this quarter to 14.3% or 17.1% before valuation adjustments up 150 basis points.  While the margins are still weak we expect to see in the coming quarters a stabilization and hopefully improvement in margins that begin to market trend. Each of our divisions is focused on responsible margins on each and every home started as we now have land marked down to where margins can be achieved.  Construction costs have been negotiated and are being renegotiated again.  With the realities of the market now known to everyone current market pricing is being remarked lower on everything except commodities. Because our standing inventory levels are extremely low and current, new construction costs are defining the cost structure of most of our deliveries, particularly as we get into the third quarter. Overhead levels are low. Markets have been consolidated and systems have been paired back to match our current volume levels.  All forms of reporting at local and corporate levels have been reconsidered in light of redefining ourselves as a leaner and more efficient company. We have reworked or are close to reworking our non-performing joint ventures.  While we have not and cannot comment on specific ventures, we have held true to our conviction that we do not support the debt of non-recourse obligation and we are not excusing partners from sharing partnership losses.  While the renegotiation process can be difficult and time consuming, many of our partnerships have presented us with an opportunity to actually enhance our investment position. To conclude, I would like to talk about our sale at year-end 2007 to the Morgan Stanley fund.  This program continues as one of our points of progress as we have reflected on the sale through the first quarter of 2008.  When we concluded this transaction the market gasped and asked why.  Today, in retrospect, we are decidedly pleased that the reasons that we concluded the deal at year end are born out today. First we raised capital by selling assets.  The land assets are situated in a vehicle that is designed to own land while cash in the current market as it has continued to evolve is a distinct advantage to Lennar’s balance sheet. Second, we concluded this sale at a time when financing was still available.  While the debt for the transaction is well situated for success as part of the fund, that facility could not be duplicated today because of debt market dislocation.  For this reason alone, our deal could not be duplicated at the same levels using 100% equity. Third, we priced this sale properly so that the sale of home sites in the future to third party home builders or at our discretion to Lennar will enable the purchaser to build homes that yield appropriate home building margins. Fourth, we remained in the deal as a minority investor and as an investor we have made an excellent purchase that will provide profitability for the future. Fifth, we cemented an excellent relationship with our partners at Morgan Stanley with whom we have worked for the past 15 years. Perhaps more importantly, through the experience of concluding this sale we have grown a potential framework for working jointly on similar assets across the country and have together learned that the barriers to entry into this business are higher than many expect. Sixth, we have used this transaction to streamline our organization and to supplement overhead coverage with fee income associated with managing the assets in the fund. Finally, we have re-injected Jeff [Karznov] into our business as an architect of business in the future and as the eyes and ears to be very close to the deals that exist in the market place at large. In the current market environment we feel we are being exposed to all deals that are in the market whether they be asset deals or debt deals.  In as much as Jeff and I and Lennar’s management team have done this before and because there is equity capital looking for ways to invest we believe that we will find opportunity once again. Many in the market have questioned this transaction both in its completion and its post-closing execution.  No doubt this is a one of a kind deal and it leaves us with one of a kind positioning for the future.  Rumors in the market seek to cast a cloud on its viability and its current standing.  With market conditions as they are, we recognize that there are some things that are just out of our control and we’re simply not going to be able to alter those elements.  But the items that are within our sphere of influence, we are all over them.  The Morgan Stanley fund, like the many other elements of our company, are within our sphere of influence and we are all over them.  These are the things that define our positioning in this very difficult market and mark the future for Lennar. With that let me turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thank you Stuart.  Good morning every body.  Over the past several quarters we have mapped out a strategy relative to our balance sheet and our joint ventures and I’d like to give you an update on the progress that we’ve made towards that strategy.  Additionally, I will provide some more color on our first quarter results. Starting with the results on our balance sheet strategy, we have continued to remain focused on strong cash generation through aggressive asset management and maintaining ample liquidity.  We have continued to carefully manage our inventory levels as they have decreased from $8.3 billion in the prior year’s first quarter to $4.6 billion during the current quarter.  The finish tones and construction in progress inventory was reduced 46% from $4.2 billion to $2.3 billion year-over-year.  Land under development was also reduced 57% from $3.6 billion to $1.5 billion in the current quarter. We have continued to manage starts to today’s realistic volume levels and as a result we have reduced starts 49% in the first quarter compared to the prior year’s first quarter and that is without unconsolidated joint ventures.  Homes under construction declined 61% from 13,900 in the first quarter of last year to 5,400 in the first quarter of 2008.  Unsold inventory under construction was reduced by approximately 58% year-over-year and we were also able to reduce our completed unsold homes count to 814 at the end of the first quarter of this year, which is a reduction from 1,659 in the first quarter of last year. Our home sites owned and controlled also reduced significantly and there is a decline of approximately 200,000 home sites from the peak in the first quarter of 2006 from 346,000 to now 145,000.  Included in that count are 72,000 home sites owned, 21,000 home sites controlled by option with third party sellers and 52,000 optioned from joint ventures. Our continued strategy of converting inventory to cash further strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter as we generated positive operating cash flow and we ended up with a $1.1 billion cash number on the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter. Additionally, as Stuart mentioned, we ended the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility which we had amended in January and was already discussed in detail on the last conference call in January. Inclusive of impairments, our net debt to total capital improved to 24.5% at the end of the first quarter from 28.6% at the end of the first quarter last year.  Our debt levels have decreased by over $300 million since the prior year’s first quarter. There has been significant progress made in both the reduction of joint venture recourse obligations as well as the reduction in the number of joint ventures.  The company has been very focused on reducing its recourse JV indebtedness which was cut in half from approximately $1.8 billion at the end of 2006 to $917 million at the end of the first quarter. Sequentially we also noted improvement from November 2007 when the balance was $1.33 billion. Lennar’s net recourse JV exposure improved from $795 million at the end of 2007 to $668 million at the end of the first quarter.  The joint ventures with JV recourse guarantees, just to highlight again, are supported by hard assets and in excess of $1 billion of partners equity which reflect the valuation adjustments that have been taken each quarter as part of our detail asset-by-asset review process, which David is going to talk about in a second. The absolute number of joint ventures have also been reduced from the peak of close to 270 joint ventures in 2006 to 210 joint ventures at the end of 2007 and now down to 180 joint ventures at the end of the quarter.  We continue to focus on considerable further reduction in this number as we go through the year. There was also significant progress in the reduction of financial letters of credit during the quarter.  Fees have also been cut significantly from a peak of $728 million at the end of 2006.  We are now down to $355 million at the end of the first quarter and sequentially from year-end there was also reduction.  That count was $424 million at the end of 2007. Turning to operating results for the quarter, we had a $0.18 loss excluding $107 million of pre-tax valuation adjustments which David is going to walk us through.  Our revenues from home sales decreased 64% to $953 million.  This was driven by a 60% decrease in home deliveries and an 8% decrease in average sales price to $278,000. The average sales price declined regionally as follows: The east was down 14% to $271,000.  Central was down 1% to $206,000.  West was down 6% to $389,000 and the other region was down 13% to $289,000. In the first quarter of 2008 we achieved the highest pre-impairment gross margin going back to the third quarter of 2006 and that number was 17.1% percent during the quarter, up 150 basis points over the prior year first quarter. As you will note, the results tie into our strategy of pricing the market to move inventory as our sales incentives were $48,000 per home versus $45,500 in the prior year.  The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to a lower land basis which reflects the exhaustive asset reviews we have had each quarter, impairing assets to be reflective of today’s market conditions as well as renegotiating land contract and options and new land purchases to achieve a land basis reflective of today’s market conditions. Additionally, we have continued to focus on reducing construction costs which also helped in the gross margin improvement.  Gross margin percentage improved in all regions except the central region where the gross margin didn’t decline as much during the down turn. David will talk about the land joint venture and management fee numbers which are most importantly impacted by valuation adjustments during the quarter. Turning to SG&A, we have been very focused on right sizing our overhead levels.  We have continued to consolidate home building operations and reduced our associated headcount.  That is now down from a peak of 14,100 to approximately 6,200 associates through today.  This focus alone with reduced variable selling expenses drove a significant reduction in absolute dollar number of SG&A expenses which are down $194 million or 53% compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of revenue SG&A did increase to 18.4% during the quarter and that was primarily a result of a 64% decline in revenue.  We do expect that this percentage will continue to decline throughout the year as our divisions are on track to significantly reduce SG&A as a percentage of revenue throughout 2008. New orders were down 57% during the quarter compared to prior year.  As you saw in the press release they did weaken in all regions.  We did note that the cancellation rate declined to 26% during the quarter from 29% in the prior year’s quarter. Financial services profit decreased from $15.9 million to a loss of $9.7 million in the quarter.  The loss for the quarter included about $2 million in severance and lease termination costs.  Mortgage decreased from a profit of $13.5 million in last year’s first quarter to $1.1 million of profit.  The decline in profitability was primarily due to a reduction in mortgage originations.  This quarter our mortgage capture rate increased from 70% in the prior year’s first quarter to 80% in the first quarter.  Fixed rate loans are about 98% of the originations versus 72% in the prior year.  Jumbo loans are only about 3% of the total loans versus 17% in the prior year. The percent of FHA loans increased to 44% in the current quarter from 9% in the first quarter of last year.  The higher loan limits with FHA went into effect after the end of our first quarter and the new FHA [selling] loan limit for 2008, which does vary by market, has increased from a max of $363,000 to approximately $730,000. Our title losses increased from about break even last year to approximately $12 million in the current year and that is the result of fewer transactions and what is typically a slower first quarter we have been aggressively reviewing the title operations branch by branch and closing a number of branches. Our tax benefit during the quarter was at a calculated rate of 42.8%,which will fluctuate throughout the year based on our results and as we indicated in the first quarter conference call we did receive $852 million of cash relating to the carry back of NOL’s to 2005 and 2006. As a result of accounting pronouncements effective during the quarter primarily related to FIN 48, we took a charge to retained earnings of approximately $30 million and as we have indicated in the last number of quarters we are not providing a current earnings goal due to the current uncertain market conditions, however we remain focused on our strategy of generating strong cash flow, carefully managing our inventory, right sizing overhead and positioning for profitability when the market returns. Let me turn it over to David now who is going to go over the valuation adjustments.
David Collins: Thank you Bruce and good morning everyone.  In conjunction with our balance sheet focus we continue to evaluate and re-evaluate our assets each quarter.  Although we believe that most of the significant impairments are behind us, we continue to remain actively engaged in our comprehensive and rigorous process of division by division asset reviews to ensure that our assets are properly stated.  In this morning’s release we outlined our first quarter valuation adjustments by segment.  However, let me quickly review the categories once again. The first category we have the home building side of our business.  We apply the standards of FAS 144 to land that we intend to build homes on and recorded a valuation adjustment of $26 million.  The segment detail is as follows:  East segment $8 million, central segment $2 million, west region $10 million and our “other” section $6 million. The second category is land that we sold or intend to sell to third parties.  Consistent with our strategy of converting inventory into cash, we identified land that we sold during the first quarter or intend to sell subsequent to the first quarter.  We applied the standards of FAS 144 to that land and recorded a valuation adjustment of $15 million.  The segment detail is as follows:  East $1 million, central $9 million, west $4 million and “other” $1 million. The next category related to land is option deposits and pre-acquisition costs.  We continue to evaluate, re-evaluate and renegotiate deposits on land under option as markets remain challenged.  For those option contracts where we were not able to adjust or readjust the terms to a level that would lead to an acceptable return based on current market conditions we made the decision to walk away from the contract as we have done in past quarters.  As a result, we wrote off $17 million of option deposit and pre-acquisition costs which represented approximately 2,600 home sites.  The segment detail is as follows:  The east segment $7 million, central $4 million, west $4 million and “other” $2 million. The last category is joint ventures.  We continue to evaluate and re-evaluate our investments in joint ventures.  We focused on the recoverability of our investment relative to the market conditions that exist today.  We applied the standards of 144 to the assets in our joint ventures including the evaluation of discounted future cash flows. Additionally, we applied the standards of APB 18 to our investment balance related to those ventures.  As a result we recorded a valuation adjustment of $49 million.  The segment detail is as follows:  East segment $5 million, west segment $43 million and “other” $1 million. So after that overview we would like to open it up to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the formal question-and-answer session.  If you would like to ask your question please press *1 on your touchtone phone.  You will be announced prior to asking your question.  If you would like to withdraw your question at any time please press *2.  Once again, to ask your question please press *1 on your touchtone phone. It looks like our first question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS.
David Goldberg: Thanks.  Good morning.  Stuart I was hoping we could revisit something you mentioned in your opening comments about the JV renegotiations and re-approaching JV partners.  Can you give us some kind of estimate, maybe a ballpark, what percent of the 180 JV’s do you have left as you have re-approached partners, started the renegotiation process and how are you finding I guess both the lenders and your partners are willing to renegotiate at this point?
Stuart Miller: Interesting question, David.  You know our joint ventures are certainly the topic of a lot of discussion and speculation. There is some myths that simply have to be dispelled.  First of all, many of our joint ventures are really in very good standing.  Some of the assets, or many of the assets in a number of our ventures are really very well positioned and we really don’t have an issue with our partners or with our lender.  In many of our ventures we have adequate collateral to support the venture for now and for the future.  It is important to understand that there is a base number of ventures that are just in good standing.  So the question really is of the ventures how many or what percent of them where there is some kind of dysfunction have we approached that we tackled and have we undertaken?  I can’t quantify that specifically but I can say it is the vast majority.  There is a subset of trouble ventures where we had partners that didn’t step up, that didn’t support, that became difficult or what not and we have resolved most of those ventures.  There are a few of them that are lingering. There are other ventures where we might have come to a debt maturity or to a moment in time where action needs to be taken where there is a funding requirement or something where there is just a negotiation.  In all of those ventures we have worked with our partners.  Where we have had difficult partners we have taken the tough position that our equity holders would expect us to be taking.  Sometimes that has meant we had to walk at the edge of the line of default or more difficult positions.  But in all instances we have negotiated and positioned ourselves to be able to manage the venture and end up with a good execution. So I’d have to say as kind of an answer to your question for the subset of ventures that are showing signs of trouble the vast majority of them have been reworked and there is a small subset that are still being reworked.
David Goldberg: Thank you for the color on that.  I guess the other question I would have would be it seems like your own land position went up sequentially by about 10,000 if I have the numbers right.  I’m just wondering what margins you have on the land that you’re taking down now?  If they are similar to what we are seeing come through the income statement now and how those pro forma when you take a look at them?
Stuart Miller: I can’t think of an exception to this and I’m always reluctant to say in all cases, but certainly in the vast majority of cases our margins are recalibrated to what I would call a responsible margin.  Is that 17%?  20%?  22%?  It is in that kind of a range on land that we’re taking down.  We’ve either impaired the land or we have renegotiated the deal on land that we are taking down.  Virtually anything that we are taking down is recalibrated to an acceptable margin for the future.  Part of the problem with answering the question is in a market where you are continuing to see decline and decline of pricing it is hard to really represent a margin.
David Goldberg: I guess that’s why I asked because it seemed like in your opening statements you were talking about possibly being able to build on the margin from where it is today and based upon the pace of sales and the deterioration of the market it would seem like that would be tough on new land as it flows through.
Stuart Miller: You know in most instances we are taking down land as needed.  To the extent that we are doing that we are basically putting homes in construction where the margin is being carefully crafted and capped at the time that we are taking down the land.  There is no question that you will have some pull outs and cancellations and some situations where a home doesn’t get sold or started immediately and the market will continue to deteriorate.  I noticed today listening to you on CNBC your forecast is that home prices will continue to go down.  In that scenario some of the margins will not be as high as projected but we continue to renegotiate land take down and renegotiate any of the land contracts that we have under contract to match up with a margin potential given market conditions as they exist at this time.
David Goldberg: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt of Wachovia.
Carl Reichardt: Good morning guys.  How are you?  Bruce can you talk a little bit about your store count relative to last year roughly and what your sense is for what it might be in 2008 as you look out here?
Bruce Gross: In terms of store count that you are referring to communities.  We haven’t really given any community data.  But to answer your question overall I’d say that it is down approximately maybe a couple hundred communities compared to the same time last year.
Stuart Miller: We’ve always felt that store count data is more confusing than it actually adds value and I know that you would say that we should leave that to you guys to decide.  But we’ve always been reluctant to talk much about store count but there is no question that the number of communities we have under development is declining and we would expect that as we look ahead it will continue to decline.
Carl Reichardt: Following up on David’s question, Stuart, as far as the gross margins…as we look at the 150 basis points in gross margin improvement year-over-year, how would you divide that out as far as a reduction in the [durax] versus building on land that you had previously impaired and you’ve lowered the basis on?
Stuart Miller: Good question.  It’s really a hard question to disentangle.  We have really tried to put pencil to paper on some of that.  I would have to say that our construction costs probably year-over-year have come down somewhere north of 10%.  The question of impairment and how they are flowing through our actual numbers these days…the answer under the best of circumstances is convoluted.  In all instances we are working off of impaired land.  What I mean by that is we have either impaired it on our books or we have renegotiated the land contract or we are buying new land at today’s market value or we are renegotiating an options price.  So when you get down to it, Carl, the price of land is now recalibrated across the board.  You could almost argue that all of our margin comes from the recapturing of pricing of land across the board.
Carl Reichardt: Okay.  I’ll get back in the queue.  Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Mr. Dennis McGill with Zellman and Associates.
Dennis McGill: Good morning guys.  How are you?  First question just has to do with and I want to talk about absolute communities.  I assume you do look at absorptions.  Thinking about where those are today I would imagine they must be well south of where you want them to be, maybe even below 0.5 a community per week.  When you think about where they are and you look out over the next year, how are you guys approaching the pricing decision?  What are you assumptions when you think about buying land today at market price about where home prices go for the industry over the next year or two years?
Stuart Miller: Well, first of all yes absorptions are down but I think that one of the things that is becoming better known and better documented is that there is a clearing site in the market.  It just happens to be particularly low.  In all instances where we’re buying new property we are recognizing that we are going to have to find our absorption levels that are acceptable at that clearly site, which is a low clearing site.  Therefore, we have adjusted our view of the market so that we are expecting absorption to be modest.  We are taking down home sites only as we need them where it is possible.  We’re pricing to market, recognizing that this is not a market where pricing can be pushed.  So that’s kind of the thinking that is injected in all the negotiations surrounding any new land acquisitions or renegotiated option positions.
Dennis McGill: Sorry to cut you off, but just to kind of push you on that.  Are you assuming that absorption can maintain their pace where they are at and you are comfortable at running well below one per community per week and pricing you think can stay where it is and it is just a function of time and confidence, like you talked about, in the community which will allow you to get absorptions back where they are?  Or are prices going to clear lower to generate absorptions that are going to generate returns for you?
Stuart Miller: We are assuming that pricing is a moving target and one that we can’t peg down.  Pricing is going to be the determinant of absorption.  So in instances wherever we can where we’re not dealing with a fast contract wherever we can we are injecting flexibility to task our take downs, our absorptions, our pricing to whatever the market brings to us.  It is one of the toughest adjustments that is happening or is going to happen in the land market right now.  That is land holders are going to have to be flexible if they are going to move their properties because this market is not going to be pushed.  It is a market where we’re going to have to take the pricing that is available, both land seller and home builder.
Dennis McGill: Okay.  I guess that’s where I am trying to understand the divergences because it seems like it would be hard to price that land today and a lot of your comments you made on the larger Morgan Stanley deal are coming to fruition with some of the bigger deals you are seeing out there being priced below.  So it just seems like a dichotomy for land prices to continue to be under pressure but home prices not to be.
Stuart Miller: Oh, no I think home prices to be under pressure and I think I said that in my opening remarks as well, but I think that land prices are under greater pressure.  I think that home prices especially in the new home world have recalibrated themselves more dramatically than land prices have.  Land prices still have a ways to go.
Dennis McGill: Okay, I think that’s fair.  Just on that note and then I’ll jump off, in a lot of your markets where are you guys seeing into the price relative to the existing home sales?
Stuart Miller: I think the anomaly that we see in the market place generally, not just for us but for the new home market, is that new home prices are generally below existing home prices.  The existing home market has not corrected as much as the new home market.  That is a relative position that is going to right itself over time as the existing home market continues to adapt to market reality.
Dennis McGill: Thanks as always guys.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Tom [Martego with Martego Capital.]
Tom [Martego]: Hi.  I was just wondering if you can comment on the recent actions within FHA and also Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac expanding the borrowing limits as to the impact that you have seen it have on activity and traffic.  I know these have been recent changes so any color you can give on that would be interesting.
Stuart Miller: Unfortunately, look these are very, very important changes and I wish there was more color to give.  These are recent changes and the filtering through to the field; we really don’t have data points yet to be able to give information.  But I would just highlight, Tom, that as we go forward the starting points that we have relative to FHA and GSE’s is an important starting point.  I think there is more work to be done and these will be important parts of what helps us get out of the supply/demand imbalance.
Tom [Martego]: Stuart have you put together marketing plans associated around the various prices that you can now charge in those markets to be within these GSE and FHA plans so you might build a smaller house to fit under the cap whereas before that might not have been something that you anticipated?
Stuart Miller: No I think in every one of our communities today we are acutely aware of what those caps are and we have recalibrated our product to fit within the limit that either exists today or where those limits are going.  And realistically the deals that are getting done today are conforming type products.  There is not a lot of jumbo business out there.  There is certainly not an AltA kind of product or market out there or anything sub-prime.  So you’ve got to be conforming and product across the country really has to be very aligned with where FHA and the GSE’s are positioned.
Bruce Gross: Our average sales price today, Tom, we’re positioned very well within the new limits and although it is early FHA limits just went into place, the lower down payment of 3% is certainly something that we are hopeful will help sales in our market place.
Tom [Martego]: In a reasonable time frame to see if they are being helpful, is it a month and a half, two months?  Have you reached out to your marketing associates to make certain they understand what the plans are?  Here in Denver just canvassing a few of the guys that I’ve talked to there is still some uncertainty as to what qualifies and what doesn’t.
Stuart Miller: Knowing your…going to have to go out and do some homework I am reluctant to make a bold statement, so I am going to say that I would be hopeful that throughout the field our people are very much aware of the programs as they are coming down.  Given your question we are going to re-intensify our making sure that our division people are really on top of that.  It has been a very big focus at the corporate level going down to the field that the programs that are available, which I think are the lifeblood of our business right now, are known down to every person in the field and I would hope that is the case throughout our company.
Tom [Martego]: I wasn’t insinuating or anything.  I was just interested in as far as what you are doing.  Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Mr. Stephen East with Pali Research.
Stephen East: Good morning.  If I could ask you just first on land spend.  Ignoring JV’s, I know it is going to be down in 2008, what do you think between acquisition and development you will spend this year?
Bruce Gross: We haven’t given an actual number out, Stephen, but we do expect it will be significantly less and as Stuart mentioned it will be matching what we’re seeing in the market and taking down home sites as needed for our business.  So it is somewhat dependent on market conditions but it will be significantly below where we were last year.
Stephen East: Okay.  I understand.  If you just look at JV spend and the quarter, when you wrap up all the different things, you reduced the number of JV’s some I assume you consolidated and some you walked away, etc.  If you look at everything involved, consolidation, infusion of cash, land buy and development, etc. what do you think you roughly spent on JV’s for the quarter from a cash perspective?
Bruce Gross: A couple of components on that, Stephen.  We did have re-margining payments of approximately $24 million during the quarter and we had land purchases from JV’s that were somewhere over $100 million and a few joint venture consolidations which wasn’t actually a spend, it would just show up on the books.  So somewhere between $100 and $200 million relating to land purchases, re-margining payments would be the number.  When we put out our cash flow statement we’ll see final numbers relative to joint venture contributions as well.
Stephen East: Okay.  Just one last question.  I appreciate that most of your JV’s are in good shape.  Two of your larger ones you all have been going through the process.  Are those renegotiation processes, etc. done or are they ongoing?  Just sort of the status of those without getting into the nitty gritty detail that you all don’t want to talk about.
Stuart Miller: It’s not that we don’t want to talk.  It’s that we really can’t.  Those have their own public debt and statements that we’re just restricted on.  The negotiations on those are ongoing but they fit the mold of exactly the discussion I laid out in my opening remarks relative to JV’s.
Stephen East: Okay.  Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Ken Zener with Merrill Lynch.
Ken Zener: Hello.  I appreciate you addressing some of the cash contributions of the JV.  If I add $850 million to where you were in the fourth quarter it looks like your cash went down a little over $400 million.  Where else did the cash go?  It looks like your units under construction was basically the same as well as your described inventory balance.
Bruce Gross: Yeah, our cash…what you’re doing Ken is you’re taking the $600 million of cash we had at year end and add in the $850 and we ended up at about $1.1 billion.  Our land purchases during the quarter, which includes what we purchased from the joint ventures was approximately $350 million during the quarter.  That would be the lion’s share.  That is down considerably from the first quarter of last year and that is where the bulk of that would be and it was a little more heavily loaded in the first quarter as we have seen in past years putting in place the home sites that we are looking at for where we need them for the current year.
Ken Zener: Okay.  And I guess related to your land spending, your units under construction sequentially they went down but your completed unsold looks like it went up modestly.  Can you talk about the desire to put new vertical?  I believe several months ago Stuart you were talking about your lack of desire to put up vertical because it just wasn’t profitable.  Has that basically changed because of your land position and you think your competitors aren’t putting as much pricing pressure given the absence of their year end?
Stuart Miller: No, our appetite for putting inventory in the ground is still very, very low.  I think that we have in all instances adjusted our starts very carefully in each market to our sales pace.  We don’t want to kid ourselves and say each home that we put under construction gets sold in advance because we recognize the cancellation rate can easily frustrate what one thinks in the sold homes under construction and make it an unsold home.  But I think that our desire to build inventory or to start new homes is very carefully matched to what we think the market demand is at the current moment.
Ken Zener: Okay thank you.  If you could just make one comment about the FHA, which to me I understand it provides a lot of liquidity for the industry in general but it doesn’t seem to address kind of the structural issue or the problem that we are in now. Meaning, giving people liquidity, i.e. 3% down, but in the deflationary environment which I think we are in and it sounds like you would agree with that they are going to be under water very soon.  Isn’t that the issue that we face?  They can get a house but then they can be unmotivated to keep the house given their slow down payment?   So I think it helps liquidity, but I’m not sure it is going to help the structural element.  Can you address that conflict?  Thank you.
Stuart Miller: I think that in today’s current market the lion’s share of the downward pressure, especially for new homes, is behind us.  The U.S. housing market has always been dependent on a sizeable part of our market looking for the lion’s share of its purchase price coming from the debt market.  We’ve had a housing market that has supported itself very well through the years by being a fairly highly levered market with fairly high loan to value ratios.  I think that the sub-prime market was a market that got away from us.  Underwriting did not start with underwriting the ability of the customer to repay.  I think in a market today where adequate underwriting controls are in place to make sure that we are financing homes to people who can afford to actually repay the mortgage and who are invested in the home – even though the investment might be relatively small, I think ensures you have a market that starts to stabilize and in a stabilized market I think you end up with homes or loans that do get repaid and a housing market that is in good condition.
Ken Zener: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JP Morgan.
Michael Rehaut: Thanks.  Good morning.  My first question I think just goes back to the impairment charges and working off…certainly I understand that you do an exhaustive review each quarter but you also mentioned that you primarily in terms of the land that you own you primarily do it on the homes that you intend to build on.  You also mentioned that certainly you are starting to moth ball and put some land aside.  I was wondering if you could give an idea of how much of that land you are sort of deferring in terms of putting it aside for maybe construction in 2009 or 2010.  Has that portion increased?
Stuart Miller: Michael I’m not sure.  You might have a mix up with one of the other conference calls.  We’ve been pretty clear as we have gone through our quarterly reviews to say we have reviewed every asset in our backlogs.  It is not just the home sites that we are preparing to build on; it is each and every asset that is in the portfolio.
Michael Rehaut: Okay.  Because I thought Stuart that I heard that before when you had the more detailed break down the first category was reviewing land that you intend to build homes on is how it was described.  I was just wondering in terms of the other assets if those are just being put aside for a later date or not?
Stuart Miller: Diane has given a report each quarter on our impairment process.  If you could speak to that Diane?
Diane Barrette: You know what I’m thinking.  Maybe there is just some confusion in how we categorize it.  As we described, the reviews that we have gone through certainly we start with the assets that we are going to build homes on, then we go to the assets that we are looking to sell in the short term, but then we also mentioned that we look at the assets that currently there is no plan to sell.  I think Stuart’s point is right that it really is each and every asset and maybe there’s just some confusion in the way we broke that discussion up.  There is no limitation as to what we look at.  We have not spent a lot of time deciding which assets were more full; in fact I think it is probably the opposite direction in that we have been very aggressive of looking at everything.  Even the assets that perhaps do go out into the future a little bit more than some of the current assets we are expelling.  We have really been very clear that we look at every single asset regardless of whether it is a current asset or longer term asset, including all the assets that exist in our joint ventures, which is where the bulk of the longer term assets would be.
Michael Rehaut: Okay.  I appreciate that.  Second question I guess along these lines.  I’m just trying to ascertain the relationship to order price versus paces and impairments.  If you look at the prior quarter, the fourth quarter, you took specifically on the land charges obviously a much, much larger number.  A lot of that had to do with the Morgan Stanley sale, but still you had $225 million in the gross margins, another $230 in the land sales.  Your order ASP fell about $22 in Q4 from Q3.  This quarter the pricing was more flat and I think at the same time you mentioned things have continued to be pretty tough and there has been some further price deflation in the market.  So my question really gets to the extent there is further negative home price deflation over the next quarter, do you still expect that to have an impact or a result in your impairment analysis?
Stuart Miller: As we sought to go through impairments and come to the end of 2007 as you described, I think that it was our decided strategy to try to get ahead of the situation instead of lagging behind it.  I think that even with order trends looking like pricing could continue downward, as I said in the opening remarks, I think we are going to see a materially lesser impact because of the heavy lifting that we have already undertaken.  I think that as we have looked at assets, as we have gone through our impairment review through time and redacted those numbers that frankly I’m not sure I want to look back on so much, we did that with an eye towards understanding that the market would likely continue to deteriorate and if the market does continue to deteriorate there might be some additional impairment it will be not near the magnitude that we have seen in the past.
Bruce Gross: Keep in mind, Mike that our land under development dollars now the first quarter are down to $1.5 billion.  There has been a significant decline of what is remaining on the balance sheet on the inventory category.
Michael Rehaut: Last question.  I appreciate the response so far.  It is very helpful.  Just on the JV’s.  I think last quarter the JV’s themselves has a set to cap at about 65% and just wanted to get a sense for whether that was sustainable or I know you have done some re-margin payments but they have been relatively small up to this point, if that is something that as you have mentioned in a number of JV’s there are ongoing discussions.  How are we to think about that going forward?  Is that an acceptable debt to capital level?  Give us some sense of how that might play out.
Stuart Miller: I think that is going to continue to be a moving target and hard to kind of peg.  Debt to capital in JV’s you know you kind of have to question at this point is it debt to capital?  Debt to value?  What the right kind of question is that has to be pointed out.  Every joint venture in reality stands on its own.  Very much an important question within each joint venture whether it is a recourse, non-recourse, debt facility and what the responsible parties has their respective obligations.  So it is kind of a generically pegged what a right debt to capital percentage is for joint ventures as a group.  I think it is something that we are probably not going to be able to peg for you.  As I noted in our last quarter conference call, all of our joint ventures were conservatively capitalized at the outset.  The market movement downward has rocked that capitalization into the negative in pretty much all instances.  But the reason they were capitalized conservatively in the beginning was to be able to withstand negative impact and that is what most of them are doing and those that are not they are being renegotiated into that position. Bruce?
Bruce Gross: One thing to add, Mike, as you look at the overall joint venture debt to total capital, if you strip out land source because we didn’t step up the basis last year when we admitted a new partner in the first quarter of last year, land source has close to 100% debt to total capital as a result of not stepping up the asset, which is included in your numbers.  In the current quarter, the debt to total capital excluding land source is about 57%.
Michael Rehaut: That’s helpful.  Sorry, let me just sneak in one more.   Kyle Canyon has been out there that it lists interest payments.  Can you give us an idea if possible of the total debt that is out there from the JV’s that you are involved with?  Maybe what percent is in that category?
Stuart Miller: Unfortunately, Mike, I am going to have to reprimand both you and Bruce.  I said we wouldn’t talk about specific joint ventures.  Bruce started it out by talking about land source and you’re following it up with Kyle.
Michael Rehaut: Bruce, I’ll take the blame on that.
Stuart Miller: We’re going to have to go to the next one.
Operator: Our next question is coming from Mr. Jim Wilson with JMP Securities.
Jim Wilson: Thanks.  Good morning guys.  I won’t ask about JV’s then.  I wanted to talk about; I guess two questions would be on cost.  The first one, as you reduced headcount dramatically and I was just wondering if you have thoughts or anything you can say on any further it might go.  On the one hand you reduced it a lot, but obviously your SG&A ratio is still 18% of revenue, obviously on depressed revenue.  But if you have any further thoughts on where that might go?  The second one is how much benefit if there is a way to quantify that or coloring that, the lower construction costs in general have helped margins or even could help margins in the future?  What have you seen and what might you see further?
Stuart Miller: Jim, it’s going to be all of these pieces happening together and in tandem.  Our SG&A will go down as we go through the year.  Each of our divisions has a plan that for the year their SG&A in relation to revenues should be close to 10%.  That is a far cry from where are today at 18% but a large part of that is that revenues in this first quarter are clearly slow.  We are continuing to move SG&A down. The re-negotiation of construction costs continues to be a positive factor that will improve margins. It might be in smaller percentage amounts as we go forward, but we are continuing to hammer at construction costs and inject reality into the market place in general.  So it really is all components, the land component as well.  Everything chipping away at driving higher margins.
Jim Wilson: Okay.  Great.  Thanks that’s all I have.
Stuart Miller: We’ll take one last question.
Operator: Our last question is coming from Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank North America.
Nishu Sood: Thanks.  I also wanted to ask about the gross margins.  Now I know you have said you don’t track this in the past but you did mention in your commentary about how the gross margin benefited from the prior impairments marking the land assets down to kind of a current value.  I was just wondering, given the magnitude of the jump if you could just help us to frame some kind of quantification of how much gross margins benefited from the amount that they were marked down to current values?
Stuart Miller: You know, Nishu, Bruce and I spend a lot of time anticipating your question today and in trying to come up with something that made sense to us given the magnitude of the impairment we have taken over the past couple of years you could almost argue that all of it has come from adjustment in pricing and land.  The bottom line is within this industry the reality is you just don’t make margins on land prices that are wrong or that are too high.  That is kind of an axiom of the industry.  So in this market where we’ve seen such degradation in pricing over the last couple of years anything that had been negotiated or bought, put on the books in 2005 or 2006 was land that was going to be producing a negative margin in 2007 and 2008.  So the only way that new homes would be built would be on re-priced land.  Now that is in combination re-priced either through impairments that have been taken or by renegotiation of contracts that were in the pipeline or purchase of new land at new prices or renegotiation of options pricing.  But it is really all the same. That is it is the re-pricing of land assets to a level where a home could be built on a positive margin.
Nishu Sood: Got it.  Now that is helpful.  The second question I had was on the financial services.  Obviously the profitability has diminished a lot.  You mentioned market conditions out there just lower originations of loans.  We have also noticed in some of your communities you have been offering below market rate financing.  I was just wondering if in the past few quarters you have stepped up the use of the below market pricing or anything to your financial subsidiary as a means of driving sales?
Bruce Gross: We have, Nishu.  We have offered some programs that we have seen some success with and there has been a bit of a step up in offering lower rates to help with the affordability of attracting buyers into our communities.
Stuart Miller: I think financing for the time being is going to be at the heart of where sales are made.  We are going to continue to see that be part of the pricing mechanism and the attraction mechanism for home buyers coming into the market.  I think if you look historically over past cycles coming out of a downward trend has always been defined by a combination of purchase pricing and financing packages.
Nishu Sood: I see.  So you have been shifting away from simple price cuts, or lets say option price reductions more towards the financing side of things?
Stuart Miller: I would say that is the case.  We have less of an options program across the board anyway so we don’t really use that tool to attract buyers.  But we definitely think it is the financing side of the program that is going to draw buyers back to the market.
Nishu Sood: Got it.  Thank you very much.
Stuart Miller: Okay.  Thank you every body for joining us.  We look forward to reconvening at the end of our second quarter.
Operator: This will conclude today’s conference.  Thank you for participating.  All parties may disconnect at this time.

Operator: I would like to introduce your conference host Mr. Stuart Miller, President and CEO. Sir you may begin.
Stuart Miller: Yes, thank you, Catherine and nice job Scott. Perfect reading. Thank you everyone for joining us. I would like to say good morning and thank you. To start, let me say that it's apparent now the 2007 has been a very tough year for homebuilders and now our 2007 fourth quarter and year end results reflect a difficult and argyles reconciliation of our company's position with the difficult market conditions that started the year and deteriorated throughout the year. You know only context of market conditions that continue to be difficult at that we'd like to share with you our thoughts on the homebuilding industry, market condition and the strategy and progress of Lennar in particular. We are joined this morning by Bruce Gross our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide detail on our numbers and Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Controller, who will participate with an update on our asset reviews and impairments as she has done for the past quarters. Just as a housekeeping note, I'd like to request that in our question and answer period that will follow our opening remarks that you please limit to just one question and one follow-up, so that we can be as fair as possible to all participants. And then, of course, you can rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Now, as noted in our press release that we issued this morning, the housing market is continued to deteriorate throughout 2007 and throughout our fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter results reflected very strong and definitive movement by our company to deal with the realities of the market conditions as they exist and processed and to try to get ahead of a curve while we expect market conditions to remain soft and perhaps continue to deteriorate as we go into 2008. In fact and then retrospect market conditions have been consistent throughout 2007 and what we now know as required us and the entire industry to reconsider our positions, our sizing, our asset based and our strategy. The market has given us cause to pull back to retrench, to reconsider and to position for another day and that's exactly what we've done. Our overall strategy throughout the fourth quarter was to address the component parts of our asset base, while we drove to turn hard assets into cash. And this is consistent with our long standing focus on our balance sheet first. This meant continuing to impair property values to properly state every asset on our books, so it can contribute to profitability in the future. It meant reconsidering the value and the risk of each and every joint venture, and it meant generating cash from home deliveries asset sales and of course a book sale of assets to a Morgan Stanley Fund that we previously announced. While the fourth quarter report card is disappointing, we made a great deal of progress in preparing for 2008 and beyond. Let me talk to some of those components. We have impaired our land positions on our books to reflect the continuing decline in the market. The evaluation process has been difficult to say the least, as with the each additional move downward in the market, a reexamination of prior impairment charges has revealed in some instances the need for further charges. Certain assets that were underwritten to a positive margin in prior quarters have acquired an additional charge this quarter to keep up with the market slowdown. In the fourth quarter, we again reviewed our assets aggressively and impaired to the full extent of the current market slide. Additionally, we curtailed all land purchases where possible and we walked from ups and deposits on land contracts and rolled our pre-acquisition costs. We've reconsidered the composition and contribution of every one of our joint ventures in the fourth quarter. Our ventures were established with the objective of either diversifying risks or gaining access to strategic assets through co-ownership. For the most part our ventures were leveraged conservatively and were positioned for stability. In evaluating these assets, we've moved aggressively to dismantle any ventures where the strategic reason for being had been frustrated either by the deterioration of the underlying asset value or to the lack of performance of our partner in their obligation. In all instances, we've shared downside risk with our partners and in most of the partnerships they have worked exactly as originally intended. We've also generated cash in a variety of ways: first, the company has remained focused on keeping inventories low, we've rigorously pursued this objective by using incentives and price reductions to sell homes and backfill cancellations. While we have slowed the start and felt paces through -- so that we can right size our operating division through the reduced demand levels in the market. Our sales, year-over-year, are now down 50% while our stocks are down similar way and our inventory is maintained at very low levels. We've also generated cash by selling land assets that because of reduced volume would not be needed for many years to come. While most of these assets sold for prices below their stated booked value due to the drop in market prices and the lack of demand for land assets. We believe that the cash value of these sales has far outstripped the value of the land asset on our books. Additionally, we generated cash by selling a bulk group of assets to a fund created by Morgan Stanley and ourselves. While this group of assets was also sold at a price for lower stated book and while we will be auctioning some of the home sites back from this fund, we believe in this instance as well that the availability of the cash generated from the deal is far more valuable than the hard asset on our books. Finally, and incidental to the execution of the sale of assets, we collected substantial cash just after year end by recovering taxes paid in prior years to losses generated in 2007. As noted in our press release, we've actually collected the $852 million recovery relative to our losses for 2007. What is not included in our press release is that the rapid recovery of this cash is due primarily to the tireless efforts of Mike Petrolino and an outstanding tax team that drove this recovery effort to completion. While our financial results for the fourth quarter are disappointing. They are reflective of our strategy for dealing with these market conditions and preparing for the future. We've continued to deliver our backlog and maintained very low inventory levels, while we've reduced our start pace to reflect the sales pace in the marketplace. While revenues for the quarter were down 49% to $2.2 billion, our balance sheet continues to remain strong with our homebuilding debt-to-total capital ratio standing at 37.5%. And while we've recorded a loss of approximately $1.3 billion for the quarter, it is reflective of our aggressive assessment of every land position, every joint venture, and every deal under option or contract within the company and reflective of the cash generation strategy designed to position us for the future. As we look ahead to 2008, we're now prepared to readjust our primary focus back to the day-to-day homebuilding operations that will define position and profitability for the future. We know well, how to build homes profitably. It requires the right price for the underlying land, the correct product on that land, pre-price construction cost and SG&A properly sized for the operation. We've refined our business model in each of our market and we've mapped out a strategy to regain margin of our now lower land cost basis. We've revamped product offerings in many of our markets. We've aggressively re-bid construction costs and we've lowered SG&A by reducing our workforce by over 50%. We've reviewed our business plan within each division and it made meaningful progress in repositioning each individual division over profitability. Within each Lennar division, there remains a daily morning meeting where sale starts closing inventory and asset base are carefully reviewed. And this review dovetails with regular executive management meetings with the same elements to review on a company wide basis. Our strategy overall has been recalibrated to match our pull back in each market. From our quarterly operations reviews, to our daily plant meetings in each division, we're focused daily on the fact that two factors will define our ability to be profitable in the near future. First, our land position rewritten to current market values will enable profitability, and second our division management teams focus on product construction cost and overhead elements are more within their control to reposition and harvest value. While we know that for the firs half of 2008 results will continue to be challenging based on the pricing and position that are already backed in our backlog, we are confident that the later of 2008 will begin to show evidence of the tremendous work that is been put forth this year. In conclusion, let me say that while it would be easy to become disheartened by the black and white numbers on the paper that define our fourth quarter and year end results for 2007. I am instead encouraged by the truly outstanding efforts put forth and the progress made by the many outstanding associates of our company. I am encouraging by the everyday leadership of Jon Jaffe in the west operating as the company plow horse relentlessly working through assets in some of the most impaired markets in the country. While in his spare time working to the due diligence process of putting together the Morgan Stanley Fund. I am encouraged by Rick Beckwitt in the East, a relatively newcomer to this company, sharing the company flag as if he attached it together himself. Not a criticism, nor a distraction in working around the clock to fix an asset base that he didn't create. I am encouraged by Bruce Gross and his treasury group working through the night to reposition the credit facility that has been suddenly turned upside down. I am encouraged by Emile Haddad, our Chief Investment Officer with his asset management group assessing, positioning, and sometime selling one asset at a time to decision our company for a future. I am encouraged just to have Jeff Krasnoff back working with us; he is just the smartest guy I know. I am encouraged by Diane Bessette and David Collins leading our accounting team to report accurately and with absolute integrity making sure through days and nights and weekends that there is backup for every reported number. I am encouraged by the fortification of our Board of Directors with the addition, the recent addition of Sherrill Hudson a past esteemed Managing Director of Deloitte & Touche and now the CEO of TECO Energy in Florida, joining our Board of Directors. I am encouraged again by Mike Petrolino one of tax group bringing home an $850 million check from the IRF in record time and why just because it is part of the plan. And I am encouraged by the many regional Presidents and division Presidents and their team who have responded for the countless request from corporate for information that never seems to end, as we try to get our hands around this turbulent market conditions while they continue their charge to innovate products for the markets, reduce constructions costs and of course at the same time reduce overhead and headcount. For all of them and many others in the country it would in the company, it would have been easier for them to put their heads in the sand and avoid the harsh realities of these difficult market conditions and let someone else clean it up. But I am encouraged because they have chosen to engage a big challenge and confront the storm that has been hit upon us. They work nighttimes, weekends and holidays to get the job done. They cancelled holidays and family time and took personally the responsibility of fixing what has been broken and they did it with less compensation and without a sound. These are truly the 24/7 soldiers of Lennar and because of them, their tireless efforts, their conviction, their love for this company, they will build upon the progress that has been made in 2007, and I am personally enthusiastic about the prospects not only for our recovery, but also our prosperity in the future. With that let me turn over to Bruce.
Bruce Gross: Thank you, Stuart and good morning everybody. I am going to discuss our balance sheet, including some detail on our joint ventures and then our fourth quarter results. Let me start with the results of the balance sheet for strategy that Stuart articulated with the focus on converting inventory to cash. We have continued to carefully manage our inventory levels, as they have decreased from $7.8 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter to $4.5 billion during the current quarter. The finished homes and construction-in-progress inventory category was reduced approximately 50% from $4.4 billion to $2.2 billion year-over-year. Land under development was also reduced to approximately 50% from $3 billion in the prior year's quarter to $1.5 billion in the current fourth quarter. Consolidated inventory-not-owned increased from $372 million to $820 million. However, it would have also declined if not for the accounting treatment of the Morgan Stanley land transaction, which increased consolidated inventory-not-owned by approximately $525 million. We have continued to manage starts to today's real estate volume levels and as a result we have reduced starts 68% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. Homes under construction also declined 68% from 17,000 in the fourth quarter of 2006 to only 5,500 in the fourth quarter of 2007. Unsold inventory under construction was reduced by approximately 66% year-over-year. And we were also able to reduce our completed unsold homes to 762 homes at 11/30/07, which is a reduction of approximately 900 completed unsold homes, since the first quarter of 2007. As a result of our aggressive focus on asset management, we have reduced home sites owned and controlled by 197,000 homes sites from the peak in the first quarter of 2006. And that's a reduction from 346,000 to a 149,000 up 57% decline. Included in the 149,000 home sites that are remaining, are 63,000 home sites owned, 23,000 controlled by option with third party land sellers, and 63,000 option from joint ventures. This quarter's option deposit walk-away expense was $218 million and represented about 12500 home sites. Our strategy of converting inventory to cash strengthened our balance sheet as follows. Inclusive of impairments our net debt to total capital was 30.2% at November 30th, 2007. Our debt levels have been reduced by approximately $318 million, since the prior year's fourth quarter. Additionally we generated significant positive operating cash flow of over $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 and this excludes approximately $450 million of cash, which we did receive by November 30th, but is not included in the operating cash flow section of our cash flow statement from the Morgan Stanley land transaction. There was $642 million of cash on the balance sheet at November 30th, and subsequent to year-end, as Stuart mentioned we further strengthen our cash position with the receipt-in-hand of an additional $852 million of cash, relating to a tax refund from the carry back of net operating losses to recoup taxes paid in our peak earnings years of 2005 and 2006. Additionally, we ended the quarter with no outstanding balance on a revolving credit facility, and we completed an amendment of the company's senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and given our liquidity position, we were comfortable reducing the company's borrowing capacity from $3.1 billion to $1.5 billion and we also amended certain debt covenant. As a result of the two rating agency downgrades to below investment grade in the fourth quarter, we were required to be in compliance with the borrowing base covenant in our senior unsecured credit facility. As a result of the borrowing base covenant, as well as impairments that were taken, we modified the minimum tangible net worth covenant, the borrowing base covenant and the maximum leverage ratio covenant. These modifications, along with our cash position provide the company with the necessary flexibility and liquidity to operate in these challenging times. We have continued to increase the transparency regarding our joint venture debt obligations; our 10-K, which is due to be filed next Tuesday, will provide a detail breakdown of categories of our joint venture debt. We have made meaningful strides in reducing our joint venturing in indebtedness from $5.5 billion in the third quarter of 2007 to $5.1 billion by the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Of these $5.1 billion of joint venture indebtedness, $3.4 billion is non-recourse indebtedness, of which $2.3 billion or 68% is specific to three large joint ventures, whereby our ownership percentage for these three joint ventures is approximately only 15%. The company has been very focused on reducing its recourse JV indebtedness, which was reduced from $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006 to $1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007. Our strategy is to continue to aggressively reduce, particularly the recourse joint venturing indebtedness. And we have agreed to further reduce the amount of this JV recourse indebtedness by $300 million in 2008 and $200 million in 2009, as part of our bank amendment. We have reduced our ownership percentage in the aggregate equity of our joint ventures from 39% at the end of 2006 to 34% at the end of 2007. Additionally the numbers of joint ventures have been reduced from a peak of approximately 270 joint ventures in 2006 to about 210 joint ventures at the end of 2007. And we're focused on considerably reducing the number of joint ventures again in 2008. During the fourth quarter there was $3 million of re-margining payments made relating to joint venture recourse indebtedness and that brought the total for all of 2007 to $84 million. Turning to the operating results for the quarter, Diane is going to work through the valuation adjustment detail in a few minutes. However, excluding these valuation adjustments, we had approximately a $0.42 last for the quarter. Our results are fairly detailed in the press release, and as you will note the results tie into our strategy of pricing-to-market to move inventory, as we delivered over 7000 homes during the quarter and as our sales incentives increased to about $59,000 per home from $47,000 per home in the prior year's quarter. As a result of our gross margin before impairments, that was 12.1% versus 14.4% in the prior year's quarter and gross margins were down in each of our segments as this was a broad based decline. Texas is probably the one market where gross margins were more stable and remain closer to its historical performance. The results in landed and joint ventures are primarily related to impairments, which Diane will cover. Turning to SG&A, we've been very focused on rightsizing SG&A and we've consolidated many of our home building operations through our markets. And the numbers relating to the 50% associate head count reduction was from over 14,000 associates at the peak in 2006 to at this point we are under 7,000 associates today. This focus along with reduced variable selling expenses are the primary drivers leading to reduced SG&A expenses of $186 million or 38% compared to the same period last year. Additionally, we have incurred unusual and non recurring expenses this quarter, primarily from severance and lease termination costs of about $12 million. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased to 15.1% during the quarter primarily as a result of the 51% decline in revenue. New orders were down 50% during the quarter compared to the prior year and new orders weakened in all of our regions. As I mentioned it was a broad based decline, experienced in all of the regions. And the same goes with backlog as well, which declined 65% and was experienced in all of our operating regions. The cancellation rate was 33% for the quarter. And turning to financial services, profits decreased from $42.9 million in the previous year's quarter to a loss of $18.7 million this quarter. The loss this quarter included approximately $5 million in severance and lease termination costs, which we expect to be non-recurring. Mortgage decreased from $35.6 million to a loss of $7.8 million. This decline in profitability was primarily due to a 45% reduction in mortgage origination dollars. However, we did increase our capture rate from 70% to 78%. Average FICO scores remained in the low 700s. This quarter fixed rate loans increased considerably to about 97% of the loans we originated compared to 70% in the prior year and jumbo loans were only about 4% of the total loans. The percent of FHA or VA loans increase to about 36% in the current quarter from 11% in the prior year. And subprime loans were only about 2% of the loan volume, but these are agency eligible product. Alt-A also was reduced considerably from about 46% in the prior year to about 6% during the current quarter, and any Alt-A product that we originate requires significant down payment as well as higher credit scores than in the past, along with partial or full verification of income. Title profits decreased from $5.7 million in the prior year to a loss of $11.8 million in the current quarter and that was the result of fewer transactions due to the slow market conditions. As a result of our operating loss, we recorded a tax benefit for the quarter and we've adjusted the tax benefit to a tax rate of 37% for all of 2007. We did not have a FASB 109 tax valuation reserve this quarter, as we concluded it is more likely then not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax asset from future earnings. However at this time we are not providing a 2008 earnings goal due to the current uncertain market conditions. We will however remain focused on generating strong cash flow, carefully managing our inventory, right sizing our overhead and positioning for profitability when the market stabilizes. Now Diane's going to provide an update on our impairment numbers.
Diane Bessette: Thank you Bruce and good morning everyone. In conjunction with our balance sheet focus, we continue to evaluate and reevaluate our assets each quarter, throughout our fourth quarter the housing market continued to deteriorate, therefore it was important once again to maintain our comprehensive and rigorous process of division-by-division asset reviews, to ensure that our asset are properly stated. In this morning’s release we outlined our fourth quarter valuation adjustments by segments, however let me quickly review the categories once again. In the first category is the Morgan Stanley land transaction, as Bruce and Stuart both mentioned, in conjunction with the strategic land investments that we found Morgan Stanley, we recorded an evaluation adjustment of $740 million on the property required by the venture. The portfolio consists of approximately 11,000 home sites in 32 communities located throughout the country. The segment details of the valuation adjustments is as follows, in the East segment $170 million, in the Central segment $28 million, West segment $509 million and others $33 million. The second category is additional land that we sold or intend to sell to third parties. Consistent with our strategy of converting inventory into cash we identified land that we sold during the fourth quarter or intend to sale subsequent to November 30th. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to that land and recorded a valuation adjustment of $230 million. The segment detail is as follow. East segment $65 million, Central segment $34 million, West segment $75 million; and other $55 million. The final category related to land is option deposits and pre-acquisition costs, we continued to evaluate, re-evaluate and re-negotiate deposits on land under option as markets continued to decline. For those option contracts where we were not able to adjust or re-adjust the terms to a level that would lead to an acceptable return, based on current market conditions, we made the decision to walk away from the contract, as we've done in past quarters. As a result, we wrote-off $218 million of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs, which represented approximately 12,500 home sites. The segment detail is as follows. East segment $45 million; Central segment $8 million; West segment $146 million; and other $18 million. Then turning to the homebuilding side of our business, we once again applied the standards of FAS 144 to land that we intend to build homes on and recorded valuation adjustment of $225 million. The segment detail is as follows. East segment $67 million; Central segment $31 million; West segment $116 million; and other $11 million. In the fifth category is our joint ventures, we focused on the recoverability of our investment related, relative to the market conditions that exist today. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to the assets in our joint ventures, including the evaluation of discounted future cash book. Additionally, we applied the standards of APB 18 to our investment balance related to those ventures. As a result, we recorded evaluation adjustment of $277 million. And the segment detail is as follows. In the East $64 million, Central $28 million, West $177 million and other $9 million. And finally: goodwill. We recorded a write-off of goodwill, related to our home building operations in the amount of $174 million. This goodwill impairment was due to a significant decline in the estimated fair value of our reporting units, subsequent to our third quarter, which resulted from significant deterioration in market conditions and the decrease in our stock price. The segment detail is as follows, the East segment $46 million, Central $28 million, West $44 million and other $55 million. So, with that quick overview, we would like to open it up for questions.
Stuart Miller: We are going to open that up to questions, Catharine are you available?
Operator: We will now begin the formal question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Good morning guys. Thank you very much for the opportunity. I am very impressed with what you have done on the balance sheet with reducing your debt-to-capital post 11/07, we actually showed it at 15%. And also, I am happy about your continuing to reduce the JV exposure and simplify it. I am wondering, realizing that you still have $1 billion of recourse debt in your plan as to continue to reduce that further: how do you give the market assurance that your balance sheet is strong? And it appears to be when so much concern related to taking the assets today that are JVs and not only the recourse debt, but all of the rest of it basically that that risk have been put back to you. And I realize it's difficult to given some market that that's not an issue, but if there is any way to assure us or give us any good thoughts on that would certainly be a help, because it appears that your balance sheet is a lot stronger than the market gives you credit for. And then just to elaborate, I guess, it's the sneak of the second question, but you mentioned that you're expecting the, all of your hard work to come to fruition in the second half of '08, wondering: if you can elaborate Stuart on that?
Stuart Miller: Yeah, listen, I don't want to overstate that Ivy, we're of course still going to be subject to market conditions, but as we look ahead it was really focused on getting each of our divisions and position to have a clear profitability model and that profitability model is focused on every home, it goes under production right now on home sight that should be properly priced. They positioned themselves with the right product and construction costs; it should be able to be profitable as we turn into the second half of the year. But the market continues to deteriorate at an accelerated basis; we're simply not going to get there. I personally have some hopes that there's going to be some actions by the Fed by the Federal Government that will shore up some of the market condition even as they still have the tendency to fight. And as we get to the back half of year, I do not expect to see sales and home prices accelerate but I am just -- may be I am just hopeful, I am hopeful that the slide does not continue at the accelerated rates and I think that we are currently well positioned in each division to be able to start saddling back, as it relates to the first part of your question, as it relates to joint ventures. One of the strong things that we have in our favor in times like this is that we worked hard on our balance sheet as prove to good times to be able to withstand and absorb some pretty steep shock. And even as we've gone through the recalibration that we have gone through now we still been able to maintain a balance sheet in pretty good shape, in very good shape and we've been able to generate cash both from operations and more importantly by doing some heads of things in the marketplace. What's going to ensure that the balance sheet will remain strong as we roll forward? I think, the answer to that wise and the very exacting evaluation is: that we will fight not only to our balance sheet assets, but also to our joint venture assets today. Nothing is going to isolate us completely from a complete melt down in the marketplace beyond where we are, but to the extent that assets retain any value at all. We have taken the charges to-date that we think are appropriate. And for any kind of market conditions with some softening ahead but not with an exaggerated softening ahead, we think, we're very well positioned to move forward and to remain stable.
Bruce Gross: And let me just add some numbers behind what Stuart saying, as you look at the joint ventures Ivy, now looking at the total joint ventures we talked about there is a total of $5.1 billion of debt of which $3.4 million is recourse debt. But there is also $2.7 billion of equity and this is after we have gone through the review just like we do with our wholly owned assets of our joint venture investments, investment-by-investment for any potential impairments and there have been impairments as you know for the last few years that bring down the investment to the appropriate stated value, we have taken significant valuation adjustments. So, there is significant equity and then there are hard assets that are additionally supporting the debt within those joint ventures. So, although, it doesn't mean we can't have a re-margining comeback to as such as we mentioned we had $84 million this year. There are hard assets, there is significant equity and the net recourse exposure has continued to decline to the company as well. In addition to the JV recourse indebtedness coming down to a billion, we've also reduced the net recourse exposure to the company from last year at $ 1 billion to the end of this quarter at $795 million.
Stuart Miller: But let me just clarify this: when you say there is $2.7 billion of equity that's not all our equity?
Bruce Gross: Correct.
Stuart Miller: Equity in large part that is partners' equity, the point that you are making now is that the ventures were established with fairly conservative debt put in place, a lot of equity in these joint ventures and there's a lot of equity to go through before the debt associated with any of those ventures becomes threatened, alright?
Bruce Gross: Correct.
Stuart Miller: Okay.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: And just to follow-up on that, I think that makes -- obviously people should may can feel better, but realizing that you have taken impairments each quarter and it looks as if you've taken less homebuilding impairments this quarter and to your point Stuart, even if things get worse, but not materially worse, you think, you could have hopefully with your asset valuations gotten. If I'm hearing you correctly, your arms around maybe the impairments peaking and seeing a lot less impairments going forward, and with that said, the 10-K that you are reporting on Tuesday hopefully, what type of increase transparency will we get on the JVs? I guess, that's a two-folded question?
Bruce Gross: Well, that's, let me talk about the joint venture transparency. We do go through and identified all of the different categories of joint venture indebtedness, and we have again, significant detail disclosure on all of these, on the joint ventures, the various categories, the balance sheet, the debt side. And I think you'll find that there is significant increase in the transparency from where we've been in the past.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great!
Bruce Gross: And that should be filed Tuesday, next week.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great!
Bruce Gross: And Ivy, I think, that the point that you are highlighting is, we've really made an efforts here to get ahead of the curve. I simply don't want to die the death of a thousand cuts, I guess, that's a little cliché, but it's really the way that I feel. I think that it's almost axiomatic that you can not make money on land that is improperly evaluated, it doesn't matter how good your homebuilding operation is. We're really positioning to get ahead and relative to some of the land positions that we have and joint ventures that we have. And I think that we've made incredible steps going forward. I have to qualify everything that I said by the uncertainties that lie ahead in the market place. And then, as it relates to the uncertainty relative to joint ventures on our book, we're certainly making additional attempts to improve the trends apparently in our 10-K and in all of our disclosures. So that people do get a good sense of comfort for the fact that we have a balance sheet that really is in good set.
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great, thanks very much.
Stuart Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carl, Reichardt, Wachovia Securities.
Carl, Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Good morning guys. How are you?
Stuart Miller: Hi, Carl.
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Thanks for taking my question. And back on the issue of joint ventures Stuart maybe one higher level; as you look forward at the business and the impression that we were covering '09 or whatever: do you expect Lennar to be more active in joint ventures to try to shrink the size of the land position on the balance sheet? Or: would less active because you're going to be taking advantage of fully on positions at the bottom to expand your business? I think why I am struggling with this: whether or not joint ventures are going to be a more important larger part of your business in future years? Or: a less significant part? Given this downturn and what has happened to this plan I am just trying to think about your strategy utilizing these going forward.
Stuart Miller: That's an interesting question Carl; I think that, I think you'd have to cut your question in a couple of different ways. Number one, I think it's absolutely the case and as we go forward we will use fewer joint ventures in terms of the numbers of partners that we will have. I think that having fewer of the smaller type joint ventures would make administrative -- it would make administratively much more manageable. And I think that would be less inclined to new use joint venture structures at the individual property level. Let me also say that certainly for the next many years, the joint venture structure another structures are simple not going to be needed, there is going to be land available. And so, I think that for many years, we are going to be very inclined to take advantage of the market conditions that exist where there will be develop some sites available and I think that we'll build our business up about. So, in terms of the number of joint ventures will be less inclined to use smaller ventures in terms of the need to use ventures its simply won't be there. So, it will be a much smaller part of our business. With that said, and using our transaction with Morgan family as a proxy, well, I classify that more of as a fund. I do think that the opportunities that exist in the open market today to be engaged in the real estate business and to the opportunistic in trouble time, is something that we have a real expertise sense. The joint venture experiences that we have had has given us a great platform for being able to be and a very effective fund manager and I think that there will be opportunities for us to put together pools of capital, but stick to engage the risk associated with lands, but buying land at the bottom of the market conditions and I think that we will use those kinds of vehicles to take our expertise and to lever that with land assets that are positioned for recovery. So, we will use the venture structures in one form or another, I think it will be more in line with a fund type concept than with an individual venture type contract. 
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Okay and then second - last question. Thinking about that recovery scenario: do you expect, as you see it now, Lennar will deepen its existing market footprint or even shrink and then re-deepen it? Or: do you expect to expand that geographic footprint as you look out?
Stuart Miller: Right now Carl we are focused on the footprints that we have in place. I think if you have to characterize the attitude within our company, it’s about looking at what we've got and getting it back to efficiency. I think we've spent a better part of 2007 focused on being asset managers. We've positioned ourselves now to get back into the primary focus of running operating division the way we know how as profit centers. And I think that we're looking at the existing footprint, we're not looking beyond it, we're not looking to materially shrink it either, but we are looking at the platform we have. We have scaled back from a headcount standpoint by almost 15%. We're really left with the eight players in all of our markets, and that’s what we're going to work with in terms of really refining the footprints that we've got. 
Carl Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: I appreciate that. Thanks Stuart 
Stuart Miller: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Zener, Merrill Lynch
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: Good morning.
Stuart Miller: Good morning.
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: With your corporate liquidity rising can you address your expected cash output for land development that you own, and some of the required lot take-downs that you have coming from options or from other joint venture structures that are acquired in ’07 -- ’08? Excuse me.
Bruce Gross: Let me comment on what’s required. With our option program, they are in fact options and there isn’t a requirement with respect to those take-downs. So, just as we’ve walked away from a very significant portion of our options over the last year across, those options that we have remaining continue to remain options. That option ability is to remain in their force. So there is virtually no specific performance. There might be no specific performance with respect to any take-down requirements. The other part of your question: what is our required outflow with respect to home sites that we own? There isn’t a number per say to put on the tables. I am assuming you are talking about development dollars required with respect to home sites owned Ken?
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: Correct.
Bruce Gross: Okay, we don’t have an exact number there, but our focus has been to very tightly manage to the current demand in each local market, with respect to any development that we are taking on and we’ve aggressively reduced as we mentioned the number of home sites, the number of starts. So we are going to manage that very tightly with respect to the demand that exists in our markets today.
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: Okay, I guess another angle on that would be completion guarantees that you do have within your joint venture structure. Could you comment? I realize the bank’s Ken will contribute the majority of the capital to complete these projects, but: can you give us a sense of how these banks are responding on some of these completion guarantees? Given that they are the largest capital contributor. Are they just saying: “let's not move forward even though you have a completion guarantee”? And: could you give us some of the different dynamics around that?
Stuart Miller: Yeah, this is a fair question; unfortunately it hasn't quite ripened yet. And every situation really is unique and different in that regard. Each of those completion guarantees is being managed differently and separately. And I think we are going to sit back and wait and see. And you're right, a lot of it is funded by the underlined venture or debt itself, but each one is going to be looked at specifically.  In some instances you have some of the properties that you are talking about Ken. Our properties are really well positioned and should be developed for current absorption. And so the completion not only guarantees, but opportunity is one that is probably the right thing to do at this point, and we'll act accordingly. Additionally there other properties where it is very clear to both us and the banks and everybody involved that the strategy is: to not go forward and to not put more money in the ground at this time. One might be talking about an excellent property, but it simply doesn't make sense to put the money in the ground. And in those instances there are pull back. So, each of these deals is being dealt with very individually.
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: Okay, I appreciate that. And just: if you could comment how much of the Morgan Stanley land sale of $1.3 billion as a carried value had been impaired before? Thank you.
Bruce Gross: That number was about a $150 million in total --.
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: So: their original purchase price was 1.45?
Bruce Gross: Approximately.
Ken Zener - Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan : Hello?
Operator: Mr. Rehaut your line is open you may ask your question.
Stuart Miller: Let's go on to the next.
Operator: One moment: Mr. Rehaut?
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Yes I am here.
Operator: Thank you, your line is open.
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Alright I was talking the whole time; I guess there is an issue there. First question was related to the tax refund or the tax cash refund and also the statement about the FAS 109 that you determined that you would be able to utilize that asset, and this is certainly at least from - I guess I have a couple of questions here. If you could just walk through the rationale on the 109 approach, because certainly the other builders are kind of looking at as the peak earnings of ’05 roll-of, that you'd have between ’06 being a lower year, ’07 being a very large loss year. The only way that you wouldn’t enter into it three year accumulative loss position in '08; the only way you'd be able to prevent that is having nice earnings year in '08, and that’s been the rational for the big tax FAS-109 write-offs. So I was wondering: if you could kind of walk through how you are getting to a different answer on that front and similarly the large cash tax refund? How you are able to recoup such a nice number post the year-end?
Bruce Gross: Well let me start me the easier one. As Stuart said earlier, we have an incredible tax team led by Mike Petrolino, who worked around the clock after year-end to facilitate the quick recoupment of the taxes that were previously paid, and that was just a lot of hard work effort, planning in order to shepherd that through appropriately in order to get a quick inflow of cash. With respect to FAS 109 which has been a hot topic here lately. From the perspective of the literature as we've looked at it and our auditors have looked at it, you have determine that it’s more likely than not, that you will be in a position to realize that tax asset in the future. One very strong negative piece of information is, if you have cumulative losses over a certain period of time based on the sick locality of your industry, and based on the cumulative losses so far we're actually positive further three years, but based on cyclicality in the business, we're not looking at a three year period, we believe that we can go to a four year period.  And again that’s one piece of information, and we'll have to look at 2008 and see how that plays out, and at that point we'll able to conclude one way or the other if there is a potential valuation adjustment depending how 2008 plays it self out. 
Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you. Second question: if you could just walk through what the changes were to the tangible net worth requirement and some of the other covenants?
Stuart Miller: I could get into the detail, it's probably easier Mike. We're filing an 8K with respect to that amendment that will have all the details relating to those items over the next day or so. And minimum tangible net worth is an easy one. It was basically a reset based on our equity value at the end of November, plus a provision, in case there is a valuation reserved in the future relating to FAS 109.
Michael Rehaut - JP. Morgan: Okay. Let me sneak in one more if I could then. The benefit in gross margins from prior impairments Bruce: would you happen to have that?
Bruce Gross: No. Mike, that's not something that we report on, because as we look at it there are land positions, they get renegotiated, some are new deals or old deals, and it's just not something that we track.
Michael Rehaut - JP. Morgan: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is coming from David Goldberg, UBS.
David Goldberg - UBS: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Stuart Miller: Hi, David.
David Goldberg - UBS: How you doing? You mentioned in your opening remarks that most of your JV partnerships have worked out as they were planned to work out. I was wondering: if we could focus on some of the ones that didn't worked out the way that you thought they would? Maybe give us an idea just kind of: what goes wrong and how they play themselves out?
Stuart Miller: Well, so many thanks for bringing that up David. It might not have -- maybe I didn't say it quite right. They're clearly haven't worked out the way we had hoped they did. Our valuations for the assets certainly wasn't to see in a loss position, I was really talking about the mechanics of the joint venture. In most instances it has really worked out exactly. But we got what we've bargained for and that is a shared risk position with a joint venture partner. What happens when they don’t work out, and we do have some that have not worked out, you have a partner that, because of the shift in market conditions, who finds himself in financial difficulty and can't uphold his end of day-to-day operations or funding interest or something like that. And we have to sit and talk and re-negotiate, this really puts us in a position relative to the partnership and relative to the bank relationship, to sit down and negotiate respective rights and obligations, and to reposition our position and the partnership in general.
David Goldberg - UBS: I guess it’s my second question, thank you for that Stuart. This is for Bruce. In terms of brining down the recourse that are in the JVs: if you could talk about mechanics behind how you actually achieve that in the next two years? Is that just the renegotiations, switching it from recourse to non-recourse? And, if so: is it more expensive for you do? Can you just talk about how you take it from $1.8 billion to a billion now?
Bruce Gross: Sure David. You know its from several different areas, the primary way is that, that is reduced is in dealing with the assets in the joint venture, which our partner might purchase, we might purchase, we might both purchase or a 3rd party can purchase. That’s the primary way that we will deal with the joint venture debt. So, once those assets are purchased, there's enough capital to pay down the recourse indebtedness at that point. Less so from transferring it to non-recourse indebtedness although we did refinance some of the recourse indebtedness in the past year. And some of that has been moved to non-recourse going forward. It's more dealing with the assets in the JV, focusing on reducing the number of JVs, and that’s how we are going to bring that number down. And we have been making a lot of progress already along those lines. And we are very comfortable we will achieve the goals that we set out and committed to with our banks.
Stuart Miller: Let me say that David, this is not a Smoking Mirrors program of moving debt from one bucket to another, each of these ventures is really being worked and focused on. Some of the ventures that we have in place have just lost their reason for being. It was that maybe we were sharing risk in equity with a partner, and today because of the shift in the market, the share risk is really just gone away. It could be that a venture has become, has moved from a responsibly levered partnership to a highly levered partnership just by the loss in equity. In each of these situations we are sitting down with partners and figuring out the right construction for moving forward, I would tell you that in some instances we have bought land or the land asset from a partnership that what we think is an attractive price, having written-off equity and positioning the venture. In other instances we have sold our equity to a partner who has taken on the debt and moved forward, so in all instances we are looking at fundamental alteration of the partnerships, some of our partnerships are excellently, excellently positioned and well there will be trails and tribulations going forward in working through a difficult market condition. They still have properly sized debt and properly positioned partners to be able to make the best of the assets.
David Goldberg - UBS: That’s great thank you 
Stuart Miller: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nishu Sood, Deutsche Bank
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Thank you. I had a few questions on some of the land transactions, first I wanted to start with, I was wondering: if you could give us some more details on the 8,300 lots? I believe it was that you sold in Florida to a metro development I think it was, specifically the kind of basis of that land on a pre-impaired basis and: what you have realized for it?
Bruce Gross: Sure Nishu let me take that one. What we did there is we had 8300 home sites that were controlled for the future, they were longer term takedowns. And strategically what we did is we converted those 8300, which was one transaction, and for a similar dollar amount what we did is we actually purchased some shorter term home sites that were able to be put in production on a more current basis. The total dollar amount of each of those transactions, the sale and the purchase was in the $20 million range, so it was not significant at all, even though it was highlighted by the media just given that it was picked up shortly after the Morgan Stanley transaction, which had significant dollars involved and about 11,000 home sites.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Oh! I see so it’s more of a swap really in terms of: when the land can be put into use?
Bruce Gross: Well there were two separate transactions, but it was a re-positioning, as we've looked at around the country with our asset base it wasn’t exactly a swap it was more of a re-positioning of assets, where we were more focused on shorter term assets that could be put into production sooner and generate cash flow quicker and to be going out as far, just given the fact that there is more land available as we look forward.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Got it. And my second question, I wanted to ask also about the land that was involved in the Morgan Stanley venture, kind of looking at it qualitatively and if you work with the numbers that you folks provided, the $1.3 billion in the 11,000 lots, we get a pretty significant number, $120,000 or north per lot, which is a pretty significant number for lots which are in different stages of development. So: does that tell us that those are the lots that were dealt with here? Or: in a higher price markets? Maybe mostly in California or perhaps more ‘A’ grade lots? How do we kind of reconcile that in terms of understanding what types of lots were involved in that transaction?
Bruce Gross: Nishu, as you do look at the geographic breakdown of those home sites, the starting point is in our lower priced markets where we typically use rolling lot options like Texas and the Carolinas. There were no home sites that went into the program. So, you are correct. These were primarily in markets where land is more expensive, in more of the coastal markets. That’s where the geographic breakdown of these 11,000 home sites would split out more appropriately. There were quite a few end markets like California, as well as Florida and various other coastal markets in particular.
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank: Okay, thanks a lot.
Bruce Gross: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Oppenheim, Banc of America Securities.
Dan Oppenheim - Banc of America Securities : Thanks very much. I was wondering: if you can talk about the inventory? They clearly are great things to generate cash and reduce debt. If we look at the backlog, which in couple of regions is below the stay orders where we presume a lot of the spec homes were sold during the past quarter: how would you look at -- how many homes are in construction right now? How many finished homes you have? Just give us absolute numbers also relative to: where we were at there six months a year ago? Just give some perspective on that.
Bruce Gross: Okay. Just a couple of those numbers which I have laid out Dan, at the start of my section, homes under construction declined 68% from a year ago, there were 17,000 homes under construction in the fourth quarter of '06 and 5500 at the end of Q4 of '07. The homes that were completed unsold have come down considerably as well. Actually, the first quarter of '07, we were about 900 completed homes higher than we ended the year and we ended the year with 762 completed unsold homes.
Dan Oppenheim - Banc of America Securities: Thanks. And if you can talk then in terms of your goals and towards strategy in terms of sales at this point? How do you describe it? And certainly it is switched to one where it is less aggressive and mothballing communities? What would the strategy be at this point?
Bruce Gross: The strategy with respect to sales, and you mentioned mothballing, so you are referring to with the land that we have remaining in our inventory. Our strategy as we have indicated has been just a match to current market demand levels.
Dan Oppenheim - Banc of America Securities: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen East, Pali Capital.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Thank you just a couple of questions. Bruce on the $500 million on free cash flow, which was pretty good, and that was before the Morgan Stanley: How would you split that out between homebuilding versus land sales?
Bruce Gross: I don't have that split here, we don't split that out on our cash flow statement Stephen.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. Just generally speaking: is the majority of it from homebuilding? Would that be a fair assumption?
Bruce Gross: Yeah, I can say that's probably fair assumption.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. And then, on the Morgan Stanley transaction, the inventory stays on your books can you help me out little bit, if the inventory stays on the books obliviously the cash come on the books as well. So: how do you relive the inventory? And: how is the cash flow through? How do we see it here in the same thing on the tax benefit? Do you get that immediately or does that have to flow through overtime later in the day?
Bruce Gross: Let me just make one comment and then I will have Diane walk through the mechanics. You indicated that the cash isn't actually on the books. So, the cash actually was received and we did receive that cash and it is on the books as of 11/30/07. But let me turn it over to Diane to walk through the mechanics of how this will work in the future.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay.
Diane Bessette : Well, I just trying to keep it simple and the reason is I am just saying on our books is, if you look at the accounting rules under FAS 66 which speaks to sales of real estate, we have what's called continuing involvement, and what that really means is that its a moment we have option agreement and right the first offer is on all the land and certainly that is not in obligation, it truly as it stated it's an option or related first offer. So, what will happen is as we decide to exercise, we are not to exercise little the option, the land will then either come of our books, and we will have a sale or it will sale our books and will be building it out. So, it will really be determined on an option-by-option basis and whether we choose to exercise that way or not.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay. And just one last question, Stuart, you have talked in the past that you wanted to get your balance sheet in a position to take advantage of opportunities that come along, I guess, as you look at the market and you look at your balance sheet: when do you think the markets start presenting those opportunities in a meaningful way? Is this a -- it's just in your opinion? Is this an '08 event or an '09 event?
Stuart Miller: That's a really interesting question, I am not sure yet, Steve, I think that there is still time, I think there is still reconciliation, I think that the homebuilding world has been a little bit ahead of the curve, the land world has been a little bit behind, liquidity in the marketplace in general has stabilized. We're odd officially stabilized land pricing, relative to where I think it's still going to go and I think that we still have some time before we start to see opportunity. I know that we're not going to compromise our balance sheet today by chasing opportunities as the market is still trying to find the bottom. So, I think that we're still driven by finding ways to take advantage of down market, as we're in right now, but we're are not inclined to further trigger to soon and I think that right now it's a little too soon.
Stephen East - Pali Capital: Okay, thanks. That's helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from Timothy Jones, Wasserman and Associates.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Good morning to all of you.
Stuart Miller: Hi, Tim?
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Hi. One thing, Carl Reichardt of course asked my two questions, I did that on the prior call on him, so it will works out. But to get one thing straight on 109 before ask the question. Are you -- isn't Deloitte allowing you to take 2005, 2006, and 2007 for your three year base year and that have to take 2008 right now?
Stuart Miller: In looking at that Tim again, the literature of 109 discusses the fact that you need to look at whether it's more likely then not that you'll be able to realize those benefits. And as you look at that and evaluate it, it's been the company's conclusion and Deloitte's conclusion that in a cyclical business like ours, as we've looked at three years is a guideline. But based on the cyclicality of your industry and what you've experienced potentially you can end up with a different number then just three year, so.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: You're using that -- 2005 number, I mean: you know darn well that 2008 there's a 1% chance that 2008 look remotely to reassemble 2005 in earnings or lack of them.
Stuart Miller: As we look forward, we would look to include 2008 based on the cyclicality, as we evaluate 109 going forward. So, we're looking at it, as I indicated it before over a four-year time period. And looking at one of the components although it's strong indicator with respect to whether or not you have a valuation reserve or not and that's accumulative loss. So, we look at that at as a four year period based on cyclicality that we've experienced in the industry.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Okay, my two questions. My first one, I think your tax man should be sanctified, but my question there is: I don't understand: how you got $850 million of cash refunds? I understand how you got the 250 from the Morgan Stanley deal, because you realized an actual loss, but for the rest of the stuff most of these losses are non-cash charges and you really had not realized the loss. Therefore: how can you take the tax benefit from the IRS?
Stuart Miller: What we had a lot of focus on Tim this year is actually taken what was a non-cash charge and as we've actually concluded transactions, converting inventory to cash, and you could see that from a large reduction in our inventory, we've concluded transactions that which time you realize that differ tax outset and it becomes an Income Tax receivable.
Bruce Gross: Yeah Tim, I think, the thing that you might be missing is that in many instances, we made an active decision to take what might have been an impairment and then turn it into a realizable tax loss by actually concluding a sale transaction relative to the underlying asset. So, while the Morgan Stanley asset sale has received a lot of attention, there were a number of asset sales that may be more behind the scene that were part of creating the transaction, the sale transaction, that resulted in the tax recovery.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Why in the world didn't the rest of the homebuilders do this?
Bruce Gross: So, we were tarred in the fourth quarter and we …
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Great job, but: why didn't the other ones do it? They just lost those benefits.
Bruce Gross: Yes Tim.
Stuart Miller: Yeah, you are going to let on some other calls Tim?
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Okay one last thing is: Your joint ventures, you got at nine months, you had about a $1.5 billion of payables, that’s an awful high end amount. What does that consist of? And: what is your responsibility on that?
Bruce Gross: We don’t have that detail right now, may be that's something we could follow up after this call.
Timothy Jones - Wasserman and Associates: Okay I will talk to you off the line, thanks a lot.
Stuart Miller: Thank you Tim. Okay and we will take one more call.
Operator: Thank you our last question will be coming from Eric Landry of Morningstar 
Eric Landry - Morningstar: Great! Thanks for taking my question.
Bruce Gross: Sure 
Eric Landry - Morningstar: First let me mention that I am short at the speed at which you received that the tax rebate and I think it’s a testament to the management down there in Miami. So congratulations!
Stuart Miller: Thank you. But let’s just mention Mike Petrolino's name one more time, he really did an excellent job.
Eric Landry - Morningstar: Wonderful work! Stuart I am lucky enough to not have to have covered the industry back in the last downturn in the late 80s, early 90s, so I am hoping for a bit of historical perspective. It appears to me that the big builders today are, several of them are, extraordinarily well prepared for whatever the market has to throw at them over next several quarters or even years whatever you have. Was this the case back in the late 80s early 90s?
Stuart Miller: No. There are some significant differences right now. First of all in prior downturn, the capitalization of most of the big homebuilders was in the 60%, 70, 80% range going into the downturn. Most of the big builders in the current field started at the beginning of this downturn with debt-to-total cap ranges in the 30%, 40%, 50% range. So the starting point was a better capitalization.  Secondly, the capitalization in the prior downturns was always defined by short-term debt. In the current market, all of the big homebuilders are capitalized with longer term fixed rate debt as a base to their base business. So, those two factors are significant shock absorbers for the homebuilders in this downturn and really are creating a lot more stability. 
Eric Landry - Morningstar: So basically, vastly more well prepared this time.
Stuart Miller: Yeah dramatically better prepared! I think the lessons of the past have been heeded in a lot of ways. It doesn’t mean that there haven’t been mistakes made, but the severity of this downturn has not yet proven fatal, and I think that most of the builders are likely to be able to sustain themselves through that. 
Eric Landry - Morningstar: I agree and they are also well prepared to harvest opportunities on your side, which brings up why I was going to questioning. There hasn’t been much insider buying and the market hasn’t really been giving any credit for this preparedness as well. Anyway I have one more question and that is: Bruce if you could let me know some relative proportion of your 63,000 owned lots that are finished?
Bruce Gross: The percentage of the owned home sites that are finished and I don’t have that handy Eric. May be that's something I could follow-up on as well 
Eric Landry - Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks 
Stuart Miller: Okay. Well listen, thank you everybody for your interest and attention. It's been a tough year and a tough quarter, and we look forward to stride forward in 2008 Thank you 
Operator: This will conclude today’s conference.  Thank you.

Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you Ken and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2007 update. In the context of what continues to be difficult market conditions, we would like to share with you our thoughts on both the home building industry in general and the progress and performance of Lennar in particular.  I am joined this morning by Bruce Gross, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide additional detail on our numbers and again by Diane Bessette, our Vice President and Controller, who will participate as she has in the past, with an update on our asset review and impairment.  I know there are a lot of questions this morning. So, accordingly, I would like to request that in our question and answer period that you please limit to just one question and one follow up so that we can be as fair as possible to all of our participants. We welcome you to join or rejoin the queue if you have additional questions and will attempt to answer as many as possible in the hour more or less that we have allotted for the call.  Now as noted in our press release that we issued this morning, these continue to be very difficult times for the home building industry. In fact, there were times when the market speaks loudly and clearly and gives an indication that it's time to pull back, to retrench and to wait for another day, and these are those times. Our third quarter results reflect a very strong and definitive movement by our company in sync with current market conditions.  Just over a week ago, we completed our quarterly operations reviews with our division management team. In those reviews, we met with each division management team. We reviewed their market condition, we reviewed their performance for the quarter and we reviewed their strategy for each asset they own in their respective market. It was clear from these meetings that current market conditions are primarily defined by the overhang of inventories in their markets which is comprised of completed homes on the ground, spec homes that are back on the market and owned homes that are up for sale. The overriding sentiment in our reviews was that the market has continued to become more and more competitive as inventories are managed and there continues to be a great deal of downward pricing pressure through the use of incentives, price reduction and incentivized brokerage fees.  Many of the competitive sales are standing inventory homes, which resulted either from cancellation or prior purchasers putting their homes on the market. All of these have very quick closings available. In most markets, there continues to be a very big push to reduce standing inventory across the industry. In addition to the standing inventories of new homes, it's apparent there's a growing backlog of existing homes both from speculators and owner occupied that are not selling at yesterday's prices and they are now repriced in order to sell. Overall, the supply of homes to sell continues to climb in many of our markets and we are not yet able to get a good reading on how quickly this inventory will be absorbed or whether it will continue to increase as foreclosures increase and add to inventory. While potential foreclosures might be limited by governmental pressure on lenders or to proposed legislation. It's currently not clear what their impact is going to be.  On the demand side, there are customers out there but they are simply not motivated. Consumer psychology has been affected by the steep drop in the market and consumer confidence in the home purchase process has waned. While the recent cut in interest rates by the Fed might begin a process of rebuilding confidence, it will most certainly not be a panacea for conditions as they exist. And although traffic has been increased by the use of incentives and mortgage buy-down programs, many of the deals that are struck have been prone to cancellation at the first sign of a better deal.  Adding to the sluggishness on the demand side is the continued deterioration of the mortgage market. An additional component of demand has been sidelined because of the inability of customers to qualify for a mortgage or because the purchaser of a customer's home needed for closing cannot qualify. While we are hopeful that the GSEs, Fannie May and Fannie Mac and the FHA, will fill the void left by the mortgage market at large, we have not yet seen stability in the mortgage market either. What is clear is that supply and demand have continued to shift more rapidly than expected.  In our last conference call, I noted that three things will have to happen before we see a stabilization and recovery in the market. They were: number one, inventories of both new and existing homes will have to stabilize first and then be absorbed; number two, the mortgage markets will need to settle and number three, consumer confidence is going to have to be restored so that purchasers once again believe in the ultimate value of their home. In fact, we have not only not seen evidence of any of these items resolving, but instead, we have seen further deterioration throughout our third quarter.  Lennar's strategy has been certain and consistent as we have seen these market conditions unfold and remain unresolved. Our overwriting strategy first and foremost is and has been to remain focused on our balance sheet. This means both generating cash wherever possible and also properly stating every asset on our book so it can contribute to profitability in the future. Our company has intensified the focus on generating cash and keeping inventories low. We have vigorously pursued this objective by using incentives and price reductions to sell homes and to backfill cancellations. While we continued to believe that the best way to generate cash flow is to deliver our inventories, that is completed homes, homes under construction and developed land by reducing prices to market pricing and converting inventory to cash, we have stopped short of fire selling our homes while others are clearing inventory.  Accordingly, our sales pace has dropped considerably and we have dramatically pulled back production to properly size our division to the reduced demand levels in the market. Our starts year-over-year are now down over 62%.  Additionally, we have curtailed all land purchases where possible and have walked from options deals on land contracts. And currently, we have impaired land positions on our book to reflect a continuing decline in the market. The evaluation process has been difficult as with each additional move downward in the market a reexamination of our impairment charges reveals the need for further charges still.  Certain assets that were underwritten to a positive margin in prior quarters require an additional charge this quarter to keep up with the market slowdown. We have even mothballed some valuable land assets where residual value analysis in today's market results in an absurdly low land valuation.  While our results for the third quarter are disappointing, they are reflective of our strategy for dealing with these market conditions and preparing for the future. We have continued to deliver our backlog while we have reduced our start pace to reflect the sales pace in the marketplace. While revenues for the third quarter were down 44% to $2.3 billion, our balance sheet continues to remain strong with our debt to total capital standing at 33.5%. And while we have recorded a loss of approximately $514 million, it is reflective of our aggressive reassessment each quarter of every land position, every joint venture and every deal under option or contract within the company in light of current market conditions and current margin.  Our management team has also maintained day-by-day focus on our business operations. We have continued to refine our business model in each of our markets and we have mapped out a strategy to regain margin when the market stabilizes. We reviewed our business plan within each division, considering sales, starts, closings, inventory and asset base and we have adjusted production levels so that they are tailored to each division's unique position. Within each Lennar division, there is a daily morning meeting where sales, starts, closing inventory and asset base are carefully reviewed. And this review dovetails with a daily executive management meeting where the same elements are reviewed on a company wide basis. Our strategy overall has been recalibrated daily to match the ongoing pullback in the overall market.  From our quarterly operations reviews to our daily plant meetings in each division to our daily corporate call, we are currently focusing on the fact that two factors will define our ability to be profitable in the future. First, our land position, rewritten to current market values, will contribute to profitability when the market stabilizes. And second, our overhead is being resized to materially reduce production levels. As noted in our press release, to date, we have reduced our headcount by 35% and we expect to continue reduction until we are sized properly for current production. While we are focused on reducing the size of our operating machine, we continue to enhance our division management team so they are properly equipped to move forward as the market stabilizes. Over the past quarters, we have revamped both our sales effort and our marketing program. Additionally, we have and continue to rebid our construction costs and we have made material gains in this regard. We have also materially reduced the number of floor plans offered and the number of SKUs that we purchase.  In conclusion, let me say that in current market conditions, it sometimes feels like the market will never recover. It will and we are working towards that better day. Our third quarter results on their face are disappointing. Nevertheless, they are part of a program to reflect the harsh realities of a very difficult market condition and to reposition our company to emerge from these times, scale down and prepare to reclaim profitability another day.  We have a seasoned management team and a group of associates at Lennar that have worked through difficult market conditions before. Both I and they know that times like these require 24/7 attention and focuses, and we are most certainly on that program. In that regard, I would like to thank the many associates who have weathered the sometimes thankless undertaking required in difficult market conditions. Unfortunately, in the short term, hard work only seems to result in another step backwards. What isn't so clear is that in the long term, the investment we are making today will remake Lennar as a stronger and better company for the future.  To that end, I and our associates are focused on maintaining the strength of our balance sheet as the foundation for defining both stability in a difficult market and also future opportunity and growth as the market returns. We are focused on reducing the size of our company while improving our operations and we are focused on returning to profitability. With a strong financial position, a lean inventory position and refined operations, Lennar will be positioned to change and to adapt and to meet the opportunities and challenges of the new and at some point recovered market.  And with that, let me turn over to Bruce. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you Stuart and good morning. I am going to discuss our balance sheet and our third quarter results. We have remained very consistent with our balance sheet first strategy. Inclusive of impairments, our debt to total capital finished at 33.5% or 32.4% on a net debt to total capital basis. Our debt levels have been reduced by over $200 million since the prior year's third quarter and we continue to be positioned with ample liquidity.  We ended the quarter with $300 million of borrowings on our $3.1 billion revolving credit facility and reported $128 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have continued to carefully mange our inventory levels as they have decreased from $8.7 billion in the prior year's third quarter to $6.7 billion during the current quarter. Of this reduction, $600 million was not related to impairments.  We have continued to manage starts, as Stuart mentioned, everyday in our daily plant meetings to determine the right activity level given each market's local conditions. And as a result of the market deterioration and increased supply in the market, we have reduced starts 62% in the third quarter and that's inclusive of unconsolidated joint ventures as compared to the prior year.  Although the mortgage market was extremely volatile during the quarter, we were still able to reduce our completed unsold homes by approximately 200 homes since the second quarter of this year and they remain between one and two homes completed on average per community. As a result of our aggressive focus on asset management, we have reduced homesites homes owned and controlled by 138,000 homesites from the peak in the first quarter of 2006 from 345,000 homesites owned and controlled to 207,000, a 40% decline. Included in the 207,000 homesites are 86,000 homesites owned, 43,000 controlled by option with third party land sellers and 78,000 optioned from joint ventures. The remaining 43,000 homesites controlled by option with third parties declined almost 70% from the peak in 2006. This quarter's option deposit walk-away expense was approximately $243 million, representing 15,000 homesites that we walked away from.  In order to preserve the ample liquidity we have, we requested an amendment from our lenders to eliminate the interest coverage ratio covenant and instead convert its calculation to define the maximum leverage ratio. We received 93% bank approval for our revolving credit facility amendment and our EBITDA to interest incurred coverage ratio this quarter on a covenant basis, and this on a trailing fourth quarter calculation, finished over 2 times coverage and our homebuilding debt to EBIT leverage also on a four quarter average was 4.5 times. These calculations exclude the impact of impairments as they are non-cash items.  We've continued to increase the transparency regarding our joint venture debt obligations. Our 10-Q will provide a detailed break down of the categories of our joint venture debt. Lennar net recourse exposure on joint venture debt was reduced from $947 million in the second quarter to $872 million in the current quarter. With respect to joint venture indebtedness, we contributed $24 million in the third quarter related to remargining of recourse debt. The majority of this was the result of impairments that have been taken at JV entity level. We have contributed $84 million on a year-to-date basis.  Despite continued volatility in the secondary loan market and tightening investor and financing guidelines, Lennar's mortgage banking subsidiaries continued to have sufficient warehouse financing for the mortgages we originate through two existing facilities with a total of 9 banks that aggregate to $1.1 billion. At August 31st, total borrowings were $528 million and the two facilities expire in April and June 2008 respectively.  There were no stock repurchases during the quarter. And in conclusion with our balance sheet, our balance sheet first strategy has been working as intended. We have been reducing inventory while renegotiating pricing on remaining controlled homesites or walking away and we have been focused on generating strong cash flow, reducing debt while maintaining ample liquidity.  Turning to the operating results for the quarter. As part of the division operating reviews, there were additional impairments, which Diane Bessette will go though in a few minutes. As a result of the $857 million pretax charge related to the valuation adjustments, write offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs, goodwill and notes receivable, excluding these adjustments, we had an $0.08 profit for the quarter.  Our 44% decrease in revenue from home sales is due to a 41% decrease in wholly-owned deliveries and a 6% decrease in average sales price on wholly-owned deliveries from 316,000 to 296,000 year-over-year. This decrease was a result of increased sales incentives from $36,000 to $46,000 per home year-over-year. The average sales price by region is detailed as follows: the East region was down 17% from $340,000 to $282,000; our Central region was flat at $205,000 and our Western region was down 2% from $451,000 to $440,000.  Our gross margin on home sales percentage before impairments decreased from 19.5% in the prior year to 14% in the current period. The gross margin percentage decreased in all of our operating regions with the rest... I'm sorry, with the East at 14.2%, the Central at 14.4% and the West at 13.5%. This decline in margin was driven by the increase in sales incentives from 10% in the prior year to 13.4% in the current quarter. The sales incentives were broad based again this quarter and generally the markets that experienced the highest gross margins in the last few years also have experienced the largest sales incentives.  Diane will comment on the land in joint ventures as she talks about the impairments.  And turning to SG&A, we have consolidated homebuilding operations in many markets and have reduced our total homebuilding division count by approximately 30%. Our associate headcount has been reduced by 35% from the peak in 2006 through to date. This focus on rightsizing SG&A along with reduced variable compensation expense are the primary drivers leading to a reduction in our SG&A expenses year-over-year for the quarter of $122 million or 29%. Additionally, we have incurred some unusual and non-recurring charges this quarter primarily impacting SG&A as follows: Severance and lease costs of approximately $7million; costs relating to our research and development facility which we have established at the former El Toro military base to produce more efficient and appealing homes was $4 million during the quarter and conversion costs to our national Lennar branding campaign was $4.5 million during the quarter. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased to 14% during the quarter, primarily as a result of the 44% decline in revenue during the quarter.  New orders were down 48% during the quarter compared to the prior year. New orders weakened as the quarter progressed with August being the weakest month, and this was a broad-based decline experienced in all of our operating regions. The number of homes in backlog declined 60% year-over-year with each region experiencing greater than a 50% decline in homes in backlog year-over-year. The cancellation rate for the quarter was 32%.  Our Financial Services profits decreased from $61.7 million in the prior year's quarter to a loss of $5.2 million. In the prior year's quarter, we had a gain of over $18 million from the sale of our personal lines insurance business that is not recurring. Mortgage decreased from $32.5 million to a loss of $2.3 million. The decline in profitability was due to a 34% reduction in mortgage origination and the $9.3 million of partial write-offs of land seller notes receivable. These notes are a result of land sales made by the homebuilder with a portion of the sales price taken in the form of a note. This quarter our mortgage capture rate increased from 67% to 72% and this quarter as you know, the mortgage market experienced tremendous volatility and following our mortgage statistics for the loans that we originated and funded during the quarter. The average FICO score remains in the low 700s. Our fixed rate loan percentage increased to 88% from 63% in the prior year. Jumbo loans were approximately 16% of the total loans and the percentage of FHA or VA loans increased to 25% in the current quarter from 12% in the third quarter of last year. Sub-prime loans are about 1% of total loan volume and these are agency eligible products in that 1%.  Alt-A product has been reduced considerably from 41% in the prior year to 25% of the originations in the current quarter. And the Alt-A product has changed significantly. The days of no verification, no down payment and low credit scores are past. Alt-A product in today's market requires credit scores over 680 along with a higher down payment and partial or full verification of income.  Our title profits decreased based on fewer transactions from $11.3 million in the prior year's quarter to a loss of $1.3 million. And as a result of our operating loss, we reported a tax benefit for the quarter and we have adjusted the tax benefit to the projected rate of 38% for 2007.  In conclusion, as we indicated, we are not providing the future earnings goal at this time due to uncertain market conditions. However, our management team remains focused on generating strong cash flow, carefully managing our inventory, rightsizing our overheard and positioning for profitability when the market stabilizes again.  Now Diane is going to provide us with an update on our impairment process. 
Diane J. Bessette - Vice President and Controller: Thank you, Bruce, and good morning. In conjunction with our balance sheet focus, we continue to realistically evaluate and reevaluate our assets each quarter.  Throughout our third quarter, the housing market continued to deteriorate. Therefore, it was important once again to maintain our comprehensive and rigorous process of division-by-division asset reviews to ensure that our assets are properly stated. So as we looked at land under option, we continue to evaluate, reevaluate and renegotiate deposits on land under option as markets continue to decline. For those option contracts where we were not able to adjust or readjust the terms to a level that would lead to an acceptable return based on current market conditions, we made the decision to walk away from the contract as we have done in past quarters.  We continue to evaluate and reevaluate the fair value of land that we own. On an asset-by-asset basis, we applied the standards of FAS 144 to ensure that the carrying value of the asset did not exceed its fair value in the unpredictable market conditions that exist today. And we continue to evaluate and reevaluate our investments in joint ventures. We focused on the recoverability of our investment relative to the market conditions that exists today. We applied the standards of FAS 144 to the assets in our joint ventures including the evaluation of discounted future cash flows which should produce profitable returns in the future. Additionally, we applied the standards of APB 18 to our investment balance related to those ventures.  In this morning's release, we outlined our third quarter valuation adjustments by segment. However, let me quickly review the information once again. Starting with option deposits and pre-acquisitions costs, we wrote off approximately $243 million of option deposits and pre-acquisitions costs, which represented approximately 15,000 homesites. The segment detail is as follows: in the East segment, $45 million; Central segment, $38 million; West segment, $140 million and others $20 million.  Additionally, we recorded approximately $418 million of valuation adjustments on wholly-owned land worth between split between homebuilding $303 million and land $115 million. The segment detail for the impact on homebuilding is as follows: East segment, $93 million; Central segment, $36 million; West segment, $150 million and other $25 million. The segment detail for the impact on land is as follows: East segment, $32 million; Central segment, $16 million; West segment, $41 million and other $25 million.  Finally, we recorded approximately $171 million in total valuation adjustments related to our investments in joint ventures. The segment detail is as follows: East, $23 million; Central, $15 million; West, $129 million and other $4 million.  So as we look ahead, what do we see with respect to future valuation issues? That is a difficult question to answer because future market conditions are still uncertain. But our direction is very clear: we will continue to focus on our balance sheet through our comprehensive and rigorous quarterly assets reviews that focus on a realistic evaluation of our assets in current market conditions. Through these reviews, we will continue to ensure that our balance sheet is accurately stated as market conditions continue to revolve.  And now, we'd like to open it up for questions.  Question And Answer 
Operator: Great, thank you very much. And again, ladies and gentlemen, if you do, could you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up during the Q&A session today. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question then today comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead. 
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Hey, good morning guys. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. 
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: I am a little confused. If we talk about your strategy, Stuart, you have always said that when you purchase land, you might as well have thought about it as if the homeowner was buying it at the time, because we are going to move it through the production line and your manufacturing machine until it got sold and you generated cash. And that's how you've been operating all along. You've been operating, moving through the inventory as many mothballed and decided to wait for a sunnier day. And yet, right now you are changing that strategy, but at the same time you have higher impairments than any one in your peer group and you have worse orders than any one in the peer group. And others are doing these sale bonanzas and wondering why you are changing strategy, from what I understood all along, you preferred with carry costs and everything associated with holding land, was not what you guys were strategically going to do in a downturn. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, I don't think the strategy has really changed much Ivy. We continue to price market conditions, but as we went through the third quarter, we saw just so many competing programs to dramatically reduce inventory that it kind of got to a point where pricing was just unrealistic and maybe even ridiculous. I think you have to be sensible as you work through market conditions like this. Remember, we have been through these conditions before. We were anticipatory in their approach to the way that the market would reveal itself. We worked through a number of communities and a lot of inventory; we have kept our inventory low throughout. But what we don't want to do is jump into the middle of the toughest of competitive environments and sell things at below a reasonable price point. And I think that if you look backward, it seemed like we were discounting ahead of the market or we were probably moving quicker to sell some of our inventory and to work through it. That in fact was the case. But as the market has just deteriorated more and more, we don't want to go below a certain floor, and that is the floor of reasonable amount [ph]. 
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Aren't you worried, Stuart, that maybe that price that Hovnanian and Standard Pacific went to, for example, might be the real price and therefore you might even have to go below where they were and you are missing out on what could be sales today for you that can move through inventory and generate cash? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: First of all, highlighting any particular participant, it really is the market overall. And so I think that the programs that various participants have in place are good and responsible programs. Are we [ph] missing potential sales I think in advance of where we are today and being responsive to market conditions. We have pulled back on production kind of anticipating that as we came to year end in particular and as a number of factors would kind of indicate that inventories would want to be burnt through. We have pulled back production dramatically and positioned ourselves to be able to pull back sales and not work as aggressively through a sales program. Do I think that this is problematic? No. This is why we have focused so heavily on building a strong balance sheet. It's for times like these where you have to able to navigate very strange waters and have the ability to pull back and sit idly while the market moves through. And again, I just want to emphasize that both I and our management team have seen these things before, we have been through these situations. There are times where we want to be participatory in the market pricing that exist, there are times where we want to be sidelined, and we are pleased that our balance sheet gives us the latitude to be able to navigate. 
Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates: Great. Thanks a lot guys. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. 
Operator: Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with Wachovia. Please go ahead. 
Carl E. Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Good morning guys. How are you? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. 
Carl E. Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Stuart, I have a question about your current market spread. Are you now or are you anticipating, looking at your current geographic positioning, altering that in a significant way? By that I mean getting out of some markets where you have a relatively thin presence, holding on to that capital thinking about reconcentrating it later or do you expect that you keep your current geographic diversification as set? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Our current thinking, Carl, is to maintain our geographic footprint as it is. It's an unusual time where almost every market across the country is similarly impaired. There are some that are a little bit less than others, but all of the markets are down. Fundamentally, each and every one of the markets that we are in are good and strong markets. And I think that our primary focus is to scale back and scale back across the board. We still believe that diversification geographically is a good program and we are not inclined to pull out of any markets right now. 
Carl E. Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: And since that echoes what most every other builder has told me as well, despite hearing of some who have either surreptitiously or perhaps otherwise publicly exited some markets, I am trying to figure out how the hypercompetitive conditions in the marketplace ease if every one is staying where they are and they are not reducing their geographic footprint so that when things recovers, the focus on acquiring land bids [ph] up land prices quickly on the recovery. I don't see how, without reduction in the markets in which you participate, you are able to continue to see that... expect that kind of recovery in the marketplace that you do. Can you comment at all on this? I am still confused as to why builders aren't pulling back more aggressively. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think that builders are pulling back aggressively, perhaps not in geographic footprint. I hear your question, and I think that if you really think historically, most of the strategic markets in the country have been defined by smaller builders growing up and maybe ultimately becoming a part of larger builders. That trend, if there is a void in these markets as they start to recover, there will be a new group of smaller builders that emerge and fill that void. I don't think it really is going to matter whether it's the larger builders or the smaller builders that are competitive within each market. I think that what is going to resolve the market conditions is the fact that number one, people are going to recognize that the markets are more impaired than they think. There will be a pull back in volume across the board in each market. And the real... the rebuilding process rather than being a knee-jerk response to an exuberant market condition, will be a slow and methodical rebuilding process that will not lend itself to people just jumping back in and gobbling up land that's available. If you think back through prior cycles, the rebuilding process has not... or the move upward in the market has not revealed itself overnight and lent itself to people jumping back in. 
Carl E. Reichardt - Wachovia Securities: Fair enough. Thanks. I will get back in. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Okay. 
Operator: Great, thank you. And our next question then comes from the line of David Goldberg with UBS. Please go ahead. 
David Goldberg - UBS: All right, thanks. Stuart, I wonder if you could comment on how comfortable you are with your JV partners. If you are concerned about distrust among any of your JV partners and what would... can you give me some examples, hypothetical, on and how the JVs would play out in case a JV partner felt some distress or capital constraints? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: It's a good question David. Good morning. I think that you can't lump all of the JV partners together in one basket. There are some that are weaker than others. Many of our JV partners are very strong. They will each play out differently. What I will say generically across the board is that our JVs have worked well to date and I say, somewhat unfortunately, just as we have shared on the upside the opportunity to profit within our JVs, the JV structures have in fact proven to be a mitigating factor in terms of absorbing some of the downside impact. And realistically that we and our partners have shared some of the deterioration in market conditions. Where we have weaker JV partners, we will have to work with them in a more adversarial relationship. I will say that those are few and far between. In most instances in our joint ventures, we have partners that stand toe to toe with us and stand tall relative to the obligations of the venture. 
David Goldberg - UBS: Okay, thanks. And my second question was and I... please forgive me if I missed the number... but if you guys had let us know how many unsold units you had under construction or completed and how that's going in terms of the even flow process and how you are adjusting your start base given that you are seeing deterioration to the month? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: The number David as far as unsold completed inventory was over 1200 homes, which is down a couple of hundred homes from the last quarter, from the second quarter and the number of homes that were unsold that were under construction was about 5100. And as addressing your question with respect to even flow, our focus on trying to meet the market conditions as the market moves and after determining the right level of demand, we are continuing to try to spread out the activity on as close to an even flow basis as possible, but that's after we are ensuring that we are matching the demand in the marketplace. And as that demand might change in our daily plant meetings, we are adjusting accordingly. 
David Goldberg - UBS: And you don't think that given the deterioration, that's necessarily creating more inventory that's out there, because it takes a certain amount of time to lag on the start base? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, we have reduced the inventory... your question about inventory. 
David Goldberg - UBS: Yes. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Under construction. If you looked at the unsold inventory at this time last year, it was about 10,700 that were unsold under construction and we only had closer to 700 that were completed unsold. So the inventory has been reduced significantly. 
David Goldberg - UBS: Okay. Thanks. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Thank you. 
Operator: Great and thank you and our next question then comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is actually Ray Kwon [ph] on for Mike. I was wondering if you could comment on some of the turns throughout the quarter can rates, orders, pricing incentives through August and then whatever you can give us on September? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, we generally don't comment on trends into the next quarter Ray. But I will say that relative to the third quarter, we saw a downward trend through the quarter. August was clearly a worse month than the prior two... the prior two months. And relative to mortgage cancellations, there is no question that there was a spike upward in cancellations in the month of August. August really seemed to be a melting pot of all things negative, and that defined the end of the quarter as we went into fourth. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Then a follow up. Given the pretty large write-down this quarter, how much breathing room do you guys have left on the minimum tangible net worth covenants? I think it was about 500... or about 1 billion last quarter, maybe you can update on what the amount is for this third quarter. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Sure. Ray, we expect to have in excess of 900 million cushion in terms of tangible net worth covenants. So we still have ample room with respect to that covenant. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And you guys only went back to the bank on the interest coverage ratio, is that correct? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: That's correct. We went back and within that amendment, we eliminated the interest coverage covenant and as defining leverage, where we do have below a 2 to 1 interest coverage, there is a ratcheting down over time of maximum leverage. And in that calculation, we do include our portion of joint venture recourse debt and essentially eliminated most of the non-recourse debt. And that calculation today, our leverage on a covenant basis, is somewhere in the mid 40% range. 
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, good. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Great, thank you, and our next question then comes from the line of Jim Wilson with JMP Securities. Please go ahead. 
James Wilson - JMP Securities: Thanks. Good morning guys. I was wondering, Stuart, or Bruce, if you could may be color... I mean obviously everything is pretty negative in price pressure out there, but could you give a little color on where and what markets and what instances you are still seeing reasonable margins in any parts of the country where that's still the case? I know they are, I am sure, still disappointing, but where you might be seeing reasonable levels of profitability still. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Jim, it's really community by community. This has been a broad-based declined. As you looked at our gross margins excluding impairments, they were close to 14% across the board. So there is really... in the past, we have always highlighted a few markets that were better or worse, and it's really hard to depict any particular area and try to lead to a conclusion. It's really been a broad-based decline and the 14% gross margin before impairments was fairly consistent through the regions. 
James Wilson - JMP Securities: Okay. And then second question just with all the broad-based or advertised sales and the price cuts that have been associated with many builders, do you feel like you have generally or generally matched in most markets to where you see other builders have gone in pricing or have you held that longer or in turn have you been any more aggressive? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Well at certain points, Jim, we have been ahead of the curve and probably led in some of the prices and in a number of instances, more recently, we have tried to pull back short of extremely aggressive pricing. And there aren't easy answers to this to what we have done or what we should be doing. It's really touch and feel, and it's relative to each division individually and each community individually where we have had to kind of measure our response to the discounting efforts of others and make sure that we don't kind of spiral that pricing downwards to very, very, very low levels. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: And in connection with that Jim, we have really managed our inventory through the process. So with respect to pricing decisions that we are making, everything we have done has been in the context of continuing to make sure that inventory is moving downward and we are very focused on the balance sheet. 
James Wilson - JMP Securities: Okay, great. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. And we are going to a question of the line of Kenneth Zener with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Good morning. Interested in the joint ventures. If I look at your joint ventures impairment as a percent of their assets, it seems like it's a few hundred, basically 200 to 400 basis points lower than what you guys were seeing at a corporate basis. So I am just trying to understand why the joint ventures would have less impairment and seeing if that's because a joint venture run impairment tests based upon the contracts that they have with people to take down developed lots like you or other builders. So I am seeing if you can kind of explain why that might be happening if they don't need to take imperilments because they know builders are taking down lots which the builders themselves might walk away from and what that means about future funding. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think we have really looked at it or sliced it that way to make that comparison. So I don't think we are going to have a good answer for that. But we have... I can tell you as a matter of process that what we have done is looked at our joint ventures just as we look at every other asset within the company. And so we haven't made any distinction or differentiation between the evaluation process that we have in the joint venture versus others. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: But it seems like the joint venture actually has a contract with builders. It could have been from the principals such as yourself or another builder which justifies them not writing off land. I mean, so, would they just not be writing it off because they have a contract saying builder X is going to buy the land -- 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: If it doesn't get impaired until that point? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: No. In your question... embedded in your question, there are two kind of roads you can go down. Number one, maybe there is a contract with us. I can tell you that in our joint ventures where there is a contract with Lennar to sell, developed homesites, Lennar has aggressively gone back, renegotiated those deals to market conditions or walked away even from joint venture deals. As it relates to third party builders, we have not stuck our head in the sand and failed to recognize that any contract that might be in place might not be a contract that's performed on. So our valuation process has been very focused on real market conditions. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Okay. And then I guess with the 14% gross margin ex charges, given that housing conditions deteriorate so much, it was a surprise to see a 40 BP sequential increase. Could you explain how that could be happening amid a deteriorating housing market and isolate the contribution from, let's say, your sticks and bricks reduction and quantify the amount of previous impairments that are flowing through? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: As far as the gross margin percentage, your comment in terms of the improvement, we are at 14%... and you are referring to which period? 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Well, this... I mean you had 14%. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Right. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: This quarter. Last quarter, I think it was a pre-adjusted 13.6%. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay, so you're going back to the second -- 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Sequential, correct, I'm sorry. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Correct. So it just seems like things got worse and you are doing better. Even though your impairment is clearly a document deterioration in either absorptions or price, a combination of both. Just trying to understand I mean how much impairment benefits flowing through or if you are just so successful renegotiating the sticks and bricks side. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Well, there are different components that go into the program and there has been a focus and there has been success on cost reduction. We have been over the last number of quarters impairing assets that needed to be impaired, and there is some contribution from that category as well. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Is that quantified? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, we haven't quantified that. So we would expect in and earlier in this year we did expect that as the year progressed, the second half of this year we would see improvement in gross margin unless the markets were to go downward. And therefore, we didn't get as much improvement in margin as we would have hoped for. So, that was actually what we were thinking earlier in the year that the margins would improve, but the decline in the markets have minimized that improvement. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Right. But you are not willing to quantify. I mean it seems it's a pretty... it seems strange that it would be, in a worsening housing market, up sequentially. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes. No -- 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: I just think people are more concerned about the real returns on your capital than the impaired benefits. So I think that's really what I am trying to drive at is what the real returns on your business are ex these impairment benefits and charges since that's how you are presenting it. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, we haven't quantified that, and keep in mind that as we are trying to make sure that our land base is appropriate for today's market conditions, it comes from different buckets. You have some impairments, you have renegotiation of homesites that we've optioned with third parties or joint ventures. So you have to keep in mind all those different buckets that factor in to try to appropriately state lands at where today's market conditions are. 
Kenneth R. Zener - Merrill Lynchand Company: Thank you. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You are welcome. 
Operator: Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Susan Berliner with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead. 
Susan Berliner - Bear Stearns: Sure. Good morning. I just wanted to kind of touch on free cash flow. It seemed to me that last year this quarter and clearly in the fourth quarter, you generated a lot of cash and it seemed like this quarter you used cash. So I was wondering if you could quantify it. And also since the rating agencies are so focused on free cash flow, if you can give us any sort of guidance for 4Q? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Hi Susan. We remain very focused on generating strong cash flow and we continue to state that we'll be cash flow positive for the year. We have not given out a number for this quarter yet because in the computations we'll have that for our 10-Q. There is a number of different items that we have to include there relative to different categories that aren't complete yet. But our focus on balance sheet and generating free cash flow remains very aggressive and again, we believe we'll be in that positive cash flow position again with a strong balance sheet as we see the end of the fiscal year. 
Susan Berliner - Bear Stearns: Bruce, can I just follow up, but it seemed like you used cash this quarter and then last year you generated a lot. So I guess what was the rationale there? What am I... what should I take away from that? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There is nothing to take away from that. I think from our perspective, we have reduced inventory aggressively again. We are focused with the reduction of starts if you look at a 62% reduction in starts. And as Stuart mentioned, we have significantly reduced planned acquisitions. As we go forward, we are positioned to have an improving balance sheet as we continue through the year focused on cash flow generation. And I think you will see that as we get to the end of the fiscal year in November. 
Susan Berliner - Bear Stearns: Great. Thank you. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome. 
Operator: Thanks. And our next question then comes from the line of Dan Oppenheim with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead. 
Daniel Oppenheim - Banc of America Securities LLC: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you can just talk about the process which you are assessing whether to mothball land or whether [ph] to build it out. And if you'd said earlier that you are looking at... in other words, it's below reasonable levels you are mothballing now. Just I mean thinking about it, if some of the weakness in the industry now is self inflected by builders who are just continuing to build too much, is this strategy of mothballing now dependent on others pulling back as well? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I think we've gotten to a point in some markets and we are... where when you look at the cost to develop a parcel of land and to actually develop homesites and you include that and the cost of building a home and you get to a point where the residual value of the land, the land itself in well located areas is maybe close to zero. You just know that you are in a market where it just doesn't make any sense to put the next dollars into the piece of ground and you know that the land has to be worth more than zero. So it's not really by way of inventory management, land inventory management that we are making a choice in some instances to mothball the land. It's just by way of recognizing that valuation is just a SKU right now. We are living in a no-bid market relative to land sales and there will be a brighter day in terms of valuing your real estate assets. 
Daniel Oppenheim - Banc of America Securities LLC: Understood. I guess what I am wondering is that if we were to think about that and just think about home prices continuing to the fall based on the excess supply that's out there and working through it, doesn't that mean to justify land being worth more than zero you either have to... either the home price have to increase there, which someone unlikely made in markets [ph] right now, we have to see a greater reduction in the construction costs? Are you assuming that we are going to get that much more of a decline in that area coming soon? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: No, I don't think that there is going to be a great reduction in construction costs. I think that there will be some things that will be reworked in the industry. But I think that there will another day where prices move in a positive direction and I think that there will be day where once again homes sell for something greater than their replacement cost. 
Daniel Oppenheim - Banc of America Securities LLC: Thanks very much. 
Operator: Thanks. And our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank North America: Thanks. I had a question on the impairment. Are you becoming, in general I suppose in assessing these impairments, more aggressively negative in your assumptions? Because I was also, following up on what Ken was talking about earlier, a little bit surprised to see impairments at the level that they were in a quarter when gross margins were actually up sequentially. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Ken, this is Bruce. What we are looking at is the reality of the market conditions. And the market certainly took a step backwards as we went through the quarter and we are not betting on things turning around tomorrow. We are looking at the market for what it is and we are taking our best guess of what the cash flows for particular communities though their built out will look like. So with respect to the negatives, the negatives came from the market as opposed to a change in the way that we are looking at impairments. Our analysis of impairments remains consistent and we are looking at the market for what it is. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank North America: And what were the biggest deltas in terms of your assumptions? Was it on the volume side? Are you assuming pricing is going to continue to decline at a substantial pace? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, it's... I think that a big part of it is seen in absorption. Pricing is pricing and maybe it's moving down a little bit more and there is a little bit more negativity injected in the pricing. But the absorptions are really pulled out. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank North America: Okay. And just a question, Stuart, in your commentary you mentioned that a more recent phenomenon, apart from the builders continuing to take prices down, is prices coming down in the resale market. I was just wondering if maybe you could fill us in on... in your discussion, let's say with your local managers, how do your local managers respond to changes in the existing market let's say as compared to competing with the builder down the road? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: I don't think that there is a specific response that they can or do give to adjustments in the existing home market. They just... they are working with a sense of pricing within their overall market and in particular in the locale surrounding each community that they are in. The pressure in pricing might come from the existing home market or from the new home market, but what we have heard from our divisions, many of our divisions more recently is that while the existing home market had been on the sidelines in terms of adjusting pricing, the existing home market is moving much more rapidly to adjust downwards. 
Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank North America: Okay. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Pali Capital. Please go ahead. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Good morning. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Good morning. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: You talked a little bit on the JVs, on the impairments. What were the few main ones on the impairment charges? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You are talking about the specific joint ventures? 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Right. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay. We haven't really itemized those out because we have never listed out the joint ventures, and certainly there is a number of them. And the $170 million of impairment with the joint ventures, there were a few joint ventures that if you totaled them up that made up more than 50% of impairment. So it was a little bit more concentrated in a few joint ventures. But it wouldn't mean anything for the group if we named joint ventures because it's never been publicly laid out joint venture by joint venture. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Okay. And just a couple of your big JVs in California, the land source, I know you all have decided to not take down lots and I understand that has some consequences with potentially triggering reappraisals and you all had a meeting with the bankers etcetera. If you could talk about that along with your decisions to slow down the El Toro, sort of maybe compare/contrast what's going on between the two? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Those are good examples. Both of those ventures are both moving forward pretty much as underwritten. And I know that sounds strange given what you've said relative to the walking away. But in the underwriting of both of those ventures, because they are long-term land positions in very strategic markets, both of them were underwritten and stressed relative to a substantial downturn during their lifespan. And the timing of that downturn wasn't expected at the time, but the downturn forecast was very much used in the modeling of the expected profitability of those ventures. So they are both in strong positions right now and I think there is a lot of confidence in the future of both of them. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Does the land source situation, does that, I guess change... I guess I am wondering the relationship, someone asked earlier, the relationships, how they perform and that type of thing. Has this changed or is the strategy changed on it moving forward? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, that's a fair question. I think that these are two examples where we are dealing with partners that are very sophisticated and comparable financial footing to our company. And in the context of these ventures, all parties understand the market conditions that exist and we are working cooperatively to work through these times and work with our assets. I guess some of your question is has it stressed the partnership that we have acted in compliance with our rights and position within the partnership? And I would have to say I don't think so. We have a very healthy relationship with all of our partners. They understand that this market has adjusted and this is not a walk away that is cavalier nor unjustified. And so I think it's incumbent on and welcome by the partners that we recognize the realities of the market and move forward constructively. And I think we have a good, healthy working relationship with both sets of partners. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Okay. And just one another quick question for Bruce and Diane. When you all talk about on write-offs, or when I think you talked about artificially the land is temporarily sort of valued at zero type thing, which of course we all know it has economic value long term that are you required to write those down accordingly or are there different assumptions that come into play there? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: What we do, Stephen, on each of the deals is we run the cash flow through the life of the community, and that's what we do is we look at the cash flow. And if it doesn't generate positive cash flow through the life of the community, then of course we are required to write down the asset currently. But in cases where we might have mothballed the community and put it off because there is too much supply in the marketplace or some other reason, we are still looking at a cash flow that over the life of that asset will be positive. And if it required an asset write-down, we would have taken it and if didn't, then we would not. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Okay. But it doesn't automatically trigger then if you wind up mothballing? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: No, it dose not. 
Stephen East - Pali Research: Okay. Thanks. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You are welcome. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Barron with Agency Trading Group. Please go ahead. 
Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group: Hey guys. Hoping you can talk a little bit about your thinking or the math behind the options that you still haven't walked away from, how you are thinking about those. And also you have talked about some land positions that you are mothballing, what the math is on those. And my last question is whether you've contributed any additional equity capital to some of your JVs. Thanks. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Let me comment on the options and any contributions, the joint ventures. As we indicated from the peak, Alex, we had 132,000 homesites that were optioned from third party land sellers, and that's been reduced by approximately 70%. So there remains about 44,000 homesites give or take options. And with each of those, our program is we are looking at current market conditions, and if those options are reflective of current market condition and our inventory position still requires us to necessitate land in that marketplace, then there is a likelihood that we might go forward. If it doesn't, we'll try to renegotiate or we potentially might walk away from some or all of the remainder of those 44,000. We are looking at it deal by deal. With respect to any contributions that we were required to make this quarter to any of our joint ventures, we have contributed approximately about $100 million to joint ventures this quarter.  And your last question, which was with respect to the math behind the mothballing of any of the land, as we stated just a little while ago, we are looking at each asset. And each asset has its strategy when we meet with each division and review every asset. And for various reasons, there might be too much inventory in a market for the moment. We might decide that some land should be mothballed for a later date and it is land that we'd like to possibly develop in the future. We run the cash flow on that particular community and if that community needs to be in impaired, then we would be impair it. If not, we are just putting it aside and waiting for the right opportunity to moving forward. But we are very focused on balance sheet and cash flow going out the door and we are not looking to develop any communities and put dollars into the ground if we don't believe we are likely to take down those homesites or build on those homesites in the short term. So it's a very focused balance sheet strategy with respect to any land that is being mothballed today. 
Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group: And just real quick, as it pertains to the communities you impaired this quarter, how many were there and how many were reimpaired please? 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: There were over 200 active communities in totaled that were impaired and two-thirds of those approximately were new communities that were not previously impaired. 
Alex Barron - Agency Trading Group: Thank you, Bruce. 
Bruce E. Gross - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: You're welcome. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: I think we'll take one last question. 
Operator: All right, thanks. And that last question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. 
Robert Stevenson - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon now guys. In terms of deposits, there been some anecdotal stories of builders reducing the deposit requirements in order to get orders in the door. Have you guys seen any of that and are you guys actively doing that in any markets? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: There's no question that deposits have been reduced materially as some of the incentivized programs out there have come to market. It's one of the reasons that we have avoided some of the selling into the current market condition. We live in a competitive environment and we have to kind of take the market as it comes. But the market today is clearly a challenging one in terms of getting a sizeable deposit on the sale of home. 
Robert Stevenson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then I mean in terms of the can rate, when you look at that today, what's the can rate differential between when you are selling dirt or something that's under construction as at the beginning of the cycle where it's going to take four, six, eight months to develop versus stuff that's closing relatively quickly within the next 60, 90, days. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: Yes, the can rates on the homes that are... preconstruction sales tend to be higher. People who are purchasing homes that are for pretty approximate closings say within a month or two are genuinely not walking away from their purchase. 
Robert Stevenson - Morgan Stanley: But if your overall can rate is 32%, does that mean that any can... that the can rate on dirt is probably closer to 60% and the can rate on spec is... completed spec is closer to 5% or 10%? 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: We haven't done the math. I can only give you a sense. I don't what those numbers would be and I don't want to guess. 
Robert Stevenson - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks guys. 
Stuart A. Miller - President and Chief Executive Officer: All right. Well, thank you all for joining us for our update. We look forward to better times ahead and will talk again at the end of our fourth quarter. Thank you.
